[The scene changes to SpongeBob on the Bikini Bottom Television (BBTV) giving his first show since moving to the up-close and personal. He is also seen with his BBTV camera set.]
TV Announcer: And now, non-commercial commercial. BBTV has just been added to your home screen. [TV starts to decline] Suddenly quiet, all the traffic light's gone. BB... instead of going down... instead of going down. [customers gasp] Attention, everyone, is what we really want... BB... instead of going down, we're going to get... [TV explodes, causing massive mayhem] BB... instead of going down, we're going to get... [customers scream and run away]
SpongeBob: [into microphone] Mr. Krabs, sir, I think this is the time to ask you to resign. [Mr. Krabs gets on with his machine] The Krusty Krab is a restaurant and, like all great civic duty work, it must be stepped on. But in this case, the customer was hurt. So, you'll be resigning immediately.
Mr. Krabs: That's exactly what I've been sayin' all along. But what would you like to see me do? [Mr. Krabs pushes down on the table with a shovel in front of him, the shovel falls on the bottom half of the platelet. The customer screams and runs off]
SpongeBob: Hey, what do we have to say about this?
Mr. Krabs: It's easy, I'll just have some manners. [Mr. Krabs goes down on the floorboards and the shovel falls on the floor. Mr. Krabs puts the shovel back down] I know you've all followed me around and seen the world and know what a sweet, kind, generous soul... [doorbell rings] Hello? [Mr. Krabs' face is on a cup. The cupidity vanishes]
Squidward: What's this? My torrent of tears over a cup!
SpongeBob: It's Squidward. How the heck can you say that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: That's right. I pity your twisted sob stories. [Mr. Krabs shows a sad face on the customer's shoulder]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, every time I see him, I kick his butt! [customer starts a riot, Mr. Krabs starts crying and Mr. Krabs starts shoveling snow towards the customer, but he's late and the storm is really bad] How the heck can you say that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I guess he's just lost his job and can't afford to miss work. That's it. No work, no pay, no tips. Just me. The one who paved the way, Mr. Stuffy.
SpongeBob: Wow. How did you become what?
Mr. Krabs: Well, back in old days, I used to steal a lot of his stuff.
SpongeBob: Ha! humiliation!
Mr. Krabs: [a long line of customers is shown] humiliation at best? [he starts yelling and walking around stealing stuff while Squidward sits back and watches] Or was it Pearl's scepterback?
Squidward: [starts attacking the customers]
Mr. Krabs: I can't keep up this grind anymore. If I'm to be believed, he's been scepting out there for years.
SpongeBob: So he was the scepterback!
Mr. Krabs: Well, not now. What's the point?
SpongeBob: Oh, scepters, you're just sipping cocoa. [Mr. Krabs drinks a mug of cocoa from Mr. Krabs' body] Wait, Mr. Krabs? [sees himself in Mr. Krabs' body, he screams and runs around, screaming] Noooooooooo! Don'tâ€™t come back! [Mr. Krabs arrives with a bucket of snow and a shovel, he then uses the snow as a platter for snowing and runs off. He then plucks the snow to make chess pieces.]-o chess pieces!
Mr. Krabs: What on earth is going on?
SpongeBob: Oh, one thing or the other, I'm going to Madame Vaucla. [he plucks a hairpin causing it to come off and cover itself] Madame Vaucla, you are not to approach me anymore. [laughs] You know what I mean?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I meant what I said.
SpongeBob: Madame Vaucla, you've... you've come to take my crown of honor.
Mr. Krabs:
