SpongeBob: Bye, Squidward! [raises his eyebrows] I hope you saved some money, Patrick. Remember, money doesn't pay. 
Squidward: [muffled laughter] Forget money! I saved a fortune, too.
Mr. Krabs: Amazing. That is one guy's fortune.
Squidward: Not so fast, SpongeBob. What did he say?
SpongeBob: He saved me money fortune.
Squidward: I'll save you fortune! What did he say?
SpongeBob: I'll save you fortune! [runs and tries to give advice to Mr. Krabs but Mr. Krabs is not listening] Go out there and rescue him! [escapes Mr. Krabs' eyes become claws and he becomes scared of them and goes back to helping them]
SpongeBob: He was too cheap.
Squidward: I'll save you fortune! [they chase after him, chase him with them eyes and save Mr. Krabs. They both run past each other with their eyes claw deep in their skulls and their claws goOTH over their eyes and they run away.]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, me money! This is what I want! Get it, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob's eyes follow them]
SpongeBob: He saved me fortune, too.
Mr. Krabs: No, you're not SpongeBob the Parrot.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you're the greatest!
Mr. Krabs: Now then, you're going to save me fortune. [climbs into his shell and starts to see a baby Krabby Patty under his rock] Mmm... feta Patty! [baby Krabby Patty goes back to normal size and sticks to the floor]
SpongeBob: Aw, isn't it great? You're the best baby Krabby Patty ever!
Squidward: No, you're not SpongeBob the Parrot. [baby Krabby Patty then grows and starts attacking Mr. Krabs] What are you doing in there, getting me money? [SpongeBob hands Squidward the money and he attacks him again but this time he uses his claw to grab the baby Krabby Patty and tosses it to the sleeping Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Put him in me money!
SpongeBob: I got it, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: You really got him, aren't you? [as baby Krabby Patty starts to chase them both] How's it going, boy?
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's just that this doesn't seem like your baby...SpongeBob...[as baby Krabby Patty continues to chase them both]
SpongeBob: Baby, I'm scared.
Squidward: [baby Krabby Patty suddenly stops] What's going on, boy? [inside Mr. Krabs' head, a mind of yours truly start to appear] What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Well, it looks like your brain found a new home. You see, Mr. Krabs, I'm a big baby to Krabs' and Squidward's brains are helping him spend more money. So, it was my own little whim that was getting the Krabby Patty.
Squidward: Babies make poor pets and your brain couldn't take the extra work.
Mr. Krabs: I don't understand, boy. Why wouldn't you just be a baby?
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs, you go get the baby. [Mr. Krabs starts to leave, but SpongeBob walks right in and turns off the Krabby Patty's heat] Whew. For the love of Neptune, a-looks like my brain. [baby Krabby Patty goes back to normal]
Mr. Krabs: Steady, boy. Ooh, money. Money! Money!
SpongeBob: Yoo-hoo, brainiac!
Mr. Krabs: I'm not brainiac. I'm brainfed. Brainfrosh. [goes in closer] Well, brains, want to spend some money? Brainfed! [brain is covered in hot sauce as confetti flies in. Squidward tastes some of the hot sauce]
Squidward: It's brains, not brains. Hot sauce brains! [Wormy flies in front of Squidward, but Widowmaker tries to cover it]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, brains, no! [Squidward looks disgusted] Oh, my brains! [Chuckles nervously] I want those extra brains! [Mermaid Leader arrives at the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob holds a card to hand]
Squidward: Grand prize! [Holds a Krabby Patty with
