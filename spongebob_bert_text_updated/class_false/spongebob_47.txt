<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins with a storybook entitled "Patty Arcade." An apple is shown and a book entitled "Storybook" is shown. The book opens and a book named "Storybook II," is shown.]
Children: Storybook! [walks to the right of the main book]
[The book opens to show a large living room with a couch, a television, and a blue background that says "Storybook"]
Mary's Storybook: Let me start you off easy, by saying you begin with a kiss. Then, the kiss transforms you into an accordion. Then, the word Y, becomes root, and begins your revenge. [growls, hits the screen, and changes the ending] By now, I should know. "Patty Arcade" opens.
Patrick: I'm up first.
SpongeBob: I'm up first! [jumps up and hits the screen, causing the Chum Bucket to open]
Patrick: SpongeBob, what is this thing?
SpongeBob: A fork in the road. [chuckles]
Patrick: Who's with me, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That's quite a storybook for you, Patrick. You know, when you were a baby.
Patrick: Oh! I was a baby! Baby! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Aww. Let me have a look. [takes a photo of the fork then cuts to a Krusty Krab with a fork in the road next to it]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, we were all born with a desire. A desire so strong, it has cost us your lives.
SpongeBob: That's what you said. But I didn't have to pay you.
Mr. Krabs: Can't you justave it all over again, boy?
[cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are flipping patties]
SpongeBob: We're gonna have a good time.
Patrick: Isn't that so obvious?
SpongeBob: Why, if you're the only one who wants to have a good time, I've got a good idea. [takes out a piece of paper]
Patrick: Let's see. [takes out a piece of paper] I'll show you...
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Patrick!
[cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob and Patrick are flipping patties]
SpongeBob: Okay, ready for the Krabby Patty?! Go get them, Patrick! [Patrick comes out and takes a bite of the Krabby Patty]
Patrick: [Giggling and Wiggles] SpongeBob, does everybody keep their eyes wide when they get the Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: No, that's not what I said!
Patrick: Thank you, thank you!
SpongeBob: [Looks at SpongeBob and chuckles] That's a good one, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, then, why is it on the menu?
SpongeBob: No, not on the menu.
Patrick: Oh, why, why, why? Oh, why? [SpongeBob whimpers while he stands in the middle of the floor, holding up an 8-bit paper airplane] I've got a question! Patrick, where is the Krabby Patty?
Patrick: [Stops and points to the door on the right] That's right, Squidward!
Squidward: What is it?
Patrick: The Krusty Krab.
[SpongeBob starts to sulk as he sees that he's in the wrong room]
SpongeBob: Ooh, better get to the bottom of this quickly, Patrick. What are you doing, Mr. Squidward?
Patrick: Krabby Patties. Why, Mr. Squidward's the head chef of that place! And we know what he's up to. So I'm gonna need your help, hmm?
SpongeBob: We're trying to... help?
Patrick: Yeah, yeah, go get him.
[SpongeBob gets Patrick by the door]
SpongeBob: We're not helping him! We're not trying to help him! We're... not a secret society!
Patrick: [Still sulk] I still got him!
SpongeBob: [Gulps and starts breaking free] We're not trying to steal him!
Patrick: Huh? What do you mean?
SpongeBob: We're trying to retrieve the Krabby Patty.
Patrick: Well, I don't know what it is, but it's pretty nifty eh...
[Scene cuts to the Chum Bucket where SpongeBob is pointing]
SpongeBob: Well, at least we still have him.
Patrick: Yeah, well, I don't mean to
