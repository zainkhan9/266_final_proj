[The episode starts when the screen shows the exterior of Bikini Bottom. It then fades to a shot of the coffeemaker.]
Narrator: [As a boss of the ship, Squidward is shown. He answers the door] Welcome aboard, captain! [Squidward gets booted out]
Squidward: Hello. [He sees the door. He opens it and sees SpongeBob standing there, too tall for the door] I sent you here to shut down the... uhh, Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah?
Squidward: What are you, you complaining about?
SpongeBob: I'm not here to order.
Squidward: I need to order, alright. [looks up and sees a menu with lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese on it] Special! Squidward! Order up!
SpongeBob: What's this?! [covers his mouth and looks at the chef then he starts to rip the lettuce and tomato off]
Squidward: Well, it's about the only thing that I need myâ€” [cuts to SpongeBob, pointing to the menu where the pickles falls apart, then cuts to Mr. Krabs eating the pickles]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, this is terrible! Squidward's ruined! [cries]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, want to- [cuts to SpongeBob and slams the chef's door]
Captain: What happened to you?
Mr. Krabs: I'll tell you what happened to me. [cuts to Mr. Krabs outside his restaurant with SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: I'm so sorry!
SpongeBob: But what can I do?
Mr. Krabs: You could do? I got so worried about working so hard that I... I... I quit.
SpongeBob: But, but, but, but, but, but, but.
Mr. Krabs: Quit? What did you quit? Oh, well, that's hard to swallow.
SpongeBob: I can do this. [climbs into Mr. Krabs' body] I can grow hair. [weeping, then drains into the seahorse's shell] I can... oh, I've got to return to the freezer. [cut to SpongeBob on the ceiling with a cup of water] Here you go. [SpongeBob sits up]
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs' eyes have sunk into the glass cup]
Mr. Krabs: Now, SpongeBob, I see you've had enough. You've got to turn off the... uh... ice cream. [SpongeBob slowly cups the seahorse's shell. Then, he looks around and sees Squidward sleeping in his bed. Door is open, and SpongeBob falls out of it] Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Squidward?
Mr. Krabs: He's got to be more careful. What's going on with the geyser? [SpongeBob measures him with a vase] What are you peeks at?
SpongeBob: I can't see anything.
Mr. Krabs: Give me a break.
SpongeBob: You can thank me, Squidward. [jumps up to the glass cup] I could use a better angle. [Mr. Krabs screams]
Mr. Krabs: This is not a game.
SpongeBob: [lifts his glasses up] Yes, it is. Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, I sure can't. [slaps his left arm then jumps back onto his rock. He shakes his arm off the floor] Relax, boy. Let me handle your drinks.
SpongeBob: [confused] What am I supposed to do with all your stupid rudiks?
Mr. Krabs: They're your friends. Now don't tell me. Those are my friends. They're all closed up and taken care of. I have to go get my drink now.
SpongeBob: But you're not going to the ice cream parlor.
Mr. Krabs: Take me to the ice cream parlor. [Mr. Krabs walks a couple steps forward, and SpongeBob takes his drink. Mr. Krabs is puzzled now; SpongeBob takes the drink and he opens the drawer, revealing a straw] Whoa!
SpongeBob: I didn't know I had those nice nice nice muscles. [holds up his right arm] Those are my arms.
Mr. Krabs: All right, two nice nice nice muscles. What do you have here? [starts to punch himself or something and starts to throb on the floor]
Patrick: I have a bad throbbing pain
