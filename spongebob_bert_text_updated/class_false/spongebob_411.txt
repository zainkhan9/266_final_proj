<Start Ep> 
[The episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick playing in Neptune's Reef with the decorations on. Patrick comes up with a window that the two close their eyes and playfully rub it. Then he rubs it all over their pineapple outfits while laughing. Then he starts painting on their sign that says "Closed"]
SpongeBob: Whoo! Neptune's Reef! What a beautiful day! I can't help the thought of being outdoors! [laughs] I know! [laughs some more]
Patrick: [Patrick's head is in the window and SpongeBob has it so close together] Huh? [he gets hit with an acorn]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is in the window and Patrick is behind it] Huh? [he gets hit with an acorn] [Patrick slams his fist on SpongeBob's sign]
Patrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [they run into the Bikini Bottom Waterworks] You need a waterworks! [they run through the back door of the old lighthouse and SpongeBob enters by the hand]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I'll be right back. [he comes back to the SpongeBob house but points out the spot where the Krusty Krab once was. SpongeBob walks backwards but is stopped by Patrick.] I don't know where we are. Maybe we were here all along.
Patrick: Perhaps not. [he points out the broken window with a water fountain] [louder] We better fix this!
SpongeBob: Hurry, buddy, get inside this hole.
Patrick: We were here, we were... [SpongeBob starts to walk out, but Patrick ruins him from start to finish] ...here. [SpongeBob points out the broken window] This broken window is the door!
SpongeBob: Okay, pal, we messed up the Krusty Krab. But we're gonna find a way to get back to square one again.
Patrick: The only way to get back to the old Krusty Krab is to find our own new home.
SpongeBob: Okay, pal, that's the problem. We still have our broken windows. But we're going to make them break our lives to pieces.
Patrick: I know, don't you worry. [he walks off] Kind of the way to run an orphanage. [he opens a closet] Nothing makes everyone happy like hearing about new, unrevealed talent.
SpongeBob: Got it. Let's get this place rolling.
Squidward: I can't hear you. What are you saying?
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab is the only place in town still producing quality Krabby Patties. [he walks off]
Squidward: I don't get it.
SpongeBob: Look at all this success. [he walks out a couple feet later] What do we find?
Patrick: [he sighs and starts to jog in circles around the Krusty Krab] I brought my surprise. [walks up to SpongeBob] Uh-huh. Uh-huh... Squidward.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick.
Squidward: What? What?
SpongeBob: My favorite restaurant.
Squidward: Well, that's about all I know of SpongeBob's origin.
Patrick: All I know is: He's a fake. I don't want to be the man anymore.
SpongeBob: Well, that's true. But there's no need to get angry. I made myself a sandwich, and everyone wants one. [he makes a replica of himself wearing a chicken on a flute]
Squidward: [sighs] I get it. I made my own life and friends a friends a way ticket to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: What's a Krabby Patty?
Squidward: It's a sandwich made of ketchup. Everyone wants a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah. How else are you get a Krusty Krab?
Squidward: That's right! I came here as a customer and I'm here to see the man my heart desires. No one can say that for me. [he holds up apron which has the words "Man" and "Krabby Patties" on it] Anywho, I will grant your hospitality, but no stranger could be treated this way. Can I please- [SpongeBob starts to shake Squidward's hand] So, will you let me stay?
SpongeBob: Respectfully sir. Just leave me at home. [Squidward walks away]
Squidward: Isn't that great, SpongeBob? You're taking a fancy to me
