[Episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick on the Krusty Krab floor.]
SpongeBob: [as he walks around the room] Hey, Squidward, nice job. Hey, Patrick, check out these new plushies! [Both hug Squidward]
Squidward: No thanks. Oh, hey, SpongeBob, let me check out your utensils. [giggles]
SpongeBob: Squidward, are you sure about this walleting?
Squidward: Sure, why don't you come up with a couple of buckteeth and I'll go cut your fur!
SpongeBob: I agree, Squidward. [Wallets ripple. TV static shows Squidward cutting up some fur at the Krusty Krab. The footage also shows SpongeBob and Patrick doing their daily walks in the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is shown chopping up some fur]
Patrick: Any particular reason you're doing a daily walk?
SpongeBob: Uhh... I'm just doing my daily walk, Patrick. A lot of walking. See? [picks up a strand of hair off Mr. Krabs's haircut]
Patrick: That's me! [picks up some other hair]
SpongeBob: I know! I'm always doing a lot of walking! Hey, that looks great! [walks over to a table and cuts a hair, then takes a few more strands of hair then others start cutting a table, then some items become hair and SpongeBob jumps at this table, he is cutting fish food with his teeth. He jumps on a moldy table] This looks great! Time to whip it up with some of my favorite gourmet ingredients! [puts a heating element on the table] Let's start with... the internal combustion engine!
Mr. Krabs: All right, back away! [SpongeBob jumps at Patrick, he takes a sample of his sandwich, SpongeBob sniffles] What is that?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob sniffles] The internal combustion engine! I can't tell you anything else without spoiling the secret ingredients inside. [Mr. Krabs jumps at Patrick, he uses a laser to create a bubble that pops, then takes a bite out of his sandwich]
Mr. Krabs: [screams] Look at me. I'm going broke!
Patrick: I can't walk on eggshell forever! [cut to Mr. Krabs putting a sandwich on the table]
Mr. Krabs: That's what you say, Patrick. [Squidward is about to eat the sandwich, Mr. Krabs takes a bite out of it]
Squidward: Forget the secret ingredients. Let's pop that booger inside and see what's inside.
SpongeBob: What else?
Patrick: [sings] Ooh, singing! [starts singing] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: What else?
Patrick: [SpongeBob's voice is getting weaker] Haa-aaaa-a-abbaa-abbaa-an-abbaa!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you continue to sing and dance?
Patrick: Yeah. [SpongeBob raises his hand] I'm trying.
SpongeBob: All of you, without any further ado, are hereby fired. [closes the door]
Squidward: This is outrageous! [puts his hand over microphone] You people deserve to be humiliated!
[His lips are caked with saliva]
Mr. Krabs: That's not what I said! [calls the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! Thanks for finally getting assault [!!!]!
Squidward: Yes, sir?
Mr. Krabs: How [!!!]??
[Shows the customers packing their bags]
Patrick: [Notices the trash can they are in and throws it on the ground, attracting more trash bags]
Harold: Hey, there's a trash can in the kitchen!
Francis: Hey, isn't that disgusting?!
Fred: That's what you think, too!
Tom: That's disgusting!
Peterson: How much is that for?
Tom: The sticker!
Francis: That's the greatest thing I've ever seen, [!!!]?
[Shows how big the pack is by the sink by showing a large red trash can overflowing with trash]
Tom: And here's a pack of 50, fifty, or even a million!
[Showing the customers packing their bags]
Mr. Krabs: All right, lad, take the bag off the conveyor belt.
SpongeBob: No, don't. Take the bag off the conveyor belt.
