[The episode begins with live-action footage of icebergs appearing.]
Narrator: Ah, observe the majesty of the mighty iceberg. [The panoramic panoramas of icebergs, the iceberg's tongue grabbing tentacles, and their final destination is the sea: Bikini Atoll.]
Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs: Oh, yes, yes I can think of somethin'.
[The panoramic footage of Bikini Atolls begins to fade, replaced by a short clip of the ocean.]
Narrator: [holding a pan] Good night, Mr. Krabs. I beckon you to the future.
[The clip fades to a wide shot of the Gulf of Guinea. Gulf of Guinea is a gazetted island that appears over Bikini Atolls.]
Warden: [As a worried Mr. Krabs is holding a clipboard while holding up a megaphone] We have to understand if you have any dreams about us.
Narrator: [while they continue holding panoramic footage of Bikini Atolls] Come on, Mr. Krabs. Eh?
[The prisoners on Gulf of Guinea get teleported to Bikini Bottom. The prisoners on Gulf of Guinea are now living in the future.]
Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob: Now to set up the...
[Patrick puts a small umbrella on SpongeBob's head.]
Patrick: Next.
[Patrick leaves. The three go back into the hallway.]
Patrick: Uh-oh.
[Patrick drops his umbrella and sighs. He sees a menu that says "Squidward's House" and he screams. The footage of Downtown Bikini Bottom is shown. Patrick, SpongeBob, and Squidward are shown in different timeline states. SpongeBob is at the Krusty Krab but is kicked out due to Patrick causing the chain to be kicked in the other timeline].
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick. You look so shiny.
Patrick: Yeah, that.
SpongeBob: Look at all those chains.
Patrick: [fascinated] How about these?
SpongeBob: [they show the Krusty Krab today under different management than before] Wow! They changed everything.
Patrick: Oh, I forgot how big the Krusty Krab really was back then.
SpongeBob: Yeah, back then, right?
Patrick: So was the manager?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
[The footage of Bikini Bottom is shown without the buildings, except the Shell]
Patrick: And the Wreck of the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: And that was the Krusty Krab.
Patrick: All the Krusty Krab chains are standing here today.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Narrator: One hour later...
[SpongeBob is shown without a hat on his head. A long line of fish walk up and stop to pay attention. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs sitting on his chair in front of the TV.]
Mr. Krabs: [Yawns up] Your holiday party is tomorrow.
SpongeBob: [Excited] What's a holiday?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, a circus.
SpongeBob: What does a circus mean?
Mr. Krabs: It means carnival season, ol' season, the sale of lost seasonals, the sale of old videotapes, the sale of phonics, [the film lobby of the Krusty Krab] all while I'm at my walrus' house, huh, Mr. Squidward? Let me just say, you're looking at about a five-dollar fine, Mr. Squidward. [Mr. Krabs walks closer to the cashier]
Cashier: [walks up to the cashier] Excuse me, sir. Would you like a five-dollar?
Mr. Krabs: [nervously walking up] A five-dollar? Sure, I got me five-dollar.
[Mr. Krabs punch-packed the cashier into the television. The scene changes to show the three watching a videotape from Squidward's walrus' house.]
Squidward: One, two, three, four...
Bank Teller: [From inside Squidward's cash register] Sir, you have just charged a large five-dollar fine.
Bank Teller: Sir, you have also charged large five-dollar fines.
Squidward: Oh, really?
Bank Teller: Sir, you have, uh, you have, uh...
Squidward: No, no, no, please.
Bank Teller: Sir, you have, uh, you have...
Squidward: You have, uh, you have?
Bank Teller
