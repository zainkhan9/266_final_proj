[The episode begins with an exterior shot of SpongeBob's pineapple. A rainbow billows in the sky.]
SpongeBob: La, la, la, la, la, la.
[As SpongeBob walks down the aisle, two clouds rise up. The scene zooms out to reveal Bikini Bottom's Fjords. SpongeBob continues walking until he reaches the front door. He opens it and see the Fjords. The scene changes to show SpongeBob walking down the front door. He then pulls it off, revealing Mr. Krabs inside. Speaking in his own voice, "O.K.," SpongeBob "accidentally" removed the Fjords, causing the whole place to become what is between left and right. The scene changes to show SpongeBob's back. He starts to bend his head. The scene changes to show SpongeBob squeezing the center of the Fjords. The scene changes to show a very wide shot. He reaches into his pocket and takes out a quarter and goes into the mirror. Looking down. He peaks through the top. The camera shows his eyes for a second. He passes through the glass display and through the arrow-shaped reflection in the sand dunes. He passes through a few of the other points in the Fjords until he reaches the surface.]
SpongeBob: [imitates static] All right, Mr. Krabs. Uh-huh, may I—may I—may I—spectacular?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob be good. [SpongeBob lifts his head up] SpongeBob be good. [SpongeBob's keening noise is heard. The sound is picked up by the antenna on SpongeBob's head, which is extended for a second. SpongeBob's keening noise is heard again. The antenna is broken and pieces disappear. The noise is heard again. And again, the antenna is extended for a third. The antenna is heard again, moving the bottom strand of SpongeBob's DNA from green to blue. The antenna is heard again, moving the top strand of SpongeBob's DNA from red to green. SpongeBob's antenna falls off and SpongeBob's head moves backwards, the antenna being held up by Mr. Krabs. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs' house. The front door opens. SpongeBob enters.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: [holding a written note reading, "It's All About You" (Harold)] What kind of fool do you take me for? And what does that make? [SpongeBob walks up to the front door with a note that reads, "It's All About You"] Why, what are you doing here?
[SpongeBob opens the front door. He looks down. He goes upstairs. He goes up to the door that says, "The Chum Bucket"]
SpongeBob: ...it's all about me. I was the only one who said you.
[A KK drives up in the Krusty Krab. It is surrounded by fruit and dollar signs. SpongeBob gasps.]
Karen: Double-cross! Extra credit! [SpongeBob looks around.] Oh, what a mess we've become! Hey, look at us! We can't survive! Living like dogs! [SpongeBob gasps.] Isn't that the point?
[SpongeBob looks down at the floor molding. He screams.]
SpongeBob: Maintain a high level of security at all times.
[SpongeBob lowers himself in the Chum Bucket.]
Security: Misunderstandings?
SpongeBob: I'm not stealing, you idiot!
[SpongeBob jumps on top of the security railing and slams the paneling over his head. The paneling falls over giving SpongeBob a black eye. The scene cuts to the security guard usher checking on SpongeBob. He is shining a light on SpongeBob.]
Security Guard: Your evening, sir. [The usher shows Le Schnook] Shall we?
SpongeBob: I'll just have a small coffee, and a hot fine, and some milk.
Security Guard: Has Schnooker been able to extract his money from a toilet in the past ten minutes?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob looks down. He looks at the usher, who has now run off. The usher throws SpongeBob to the back of the usher. The usher looks like a soup pantry] You Guys What's the meaning of all this, son?
Le Schnook: I don't know man, but the Krabby Patties are my go to food.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob looks at the usher] That's all very wonderful, but do you really think that'll change anything?
Le Schnook: Well my friend, the Krabby Patties are in my blood
