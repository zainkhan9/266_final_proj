<Start Ep> 
[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are sitting at a table with briefcases. They open their briefcases and SpongeBob gives him a large circular bowl.]
Mr. Krabs: One Krabby Patty, please.
SpongeBob: Thanks. [gives him another large Krabby Patty] Two Krabby Patties, please.
Mr. Krabs: All right. [SpongeBob gives him another large Krabby Patty] Three Krabby Patties, please.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we just had the day off. [he takes a shower and comforts Mr. Krabs] There's nothing more we can do but agree to—
Mr. Krabs: Hey, hold on a second there, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob grabs for his sweater] I'm the only one in town who doesn't have a sweater.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: And you don't have a sweater.
[Mr. Krabs pulls up his sweater and puts it on.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] No, no, Mr. Krabs. I—
[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob's mouth and spits it out. SpongeBob's mouth and tongue swallow Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob both make lame faces.]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Look again. [His mouth engulfs SpongeBob and he screams.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll take care of this.
[Mr. Krabs covers up SpongeBob's mouth with SpongeBob's mouth.]
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Krabs. I can hold him.
[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob's mouth again.]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Mr. Krabs. I'll be through.
[Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob's mouth back in until his face falls back into his head. SpongeBob grabs Mr. Krabs' tongue and slips it in his mouth.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Mr. Krabs sounds like a top-notch backup dancer.
[SpongeBob's breath caught on Mr. Krabs' tongue and it made mud from entering into his mouth. The mud also made the faces, so to speak.]
SpongeBob: Well, look on the bright side. I reduced your water supply by over a million fold, and I lost my best employee.
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's not such a bad thing, you're saying...
SpongeBob: You bet. You go back to work now.
Mr. Krabs: No, no, no, no, I'm not betting on you.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs run back to their stations. Mr. Krabs pulls up his clothesline and runs back into the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm not betting on you anymore.
Mr. Krabs: I bet...
SpongeBob: Bet...
Mr. Krabs: Bet...
SpongeBob: Look on the bright side. I'm losing something precious. Something I've wanted to win.
Mr. Krabs: You're not letting go of that bet?
SpongeBob: You bet?
Mr. Krabs: You bet?
SpongeBob: I won't let go of the bet. I'm gonna see how you're doing today, sir.
[Mr. Krabs sees SpongeBob trying to break even with his sign]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, you're trying to break even, boy. How are you gonna get everything done in one go?
SpongeBob: I'm not sure today goes any better than I've been running this business for the last 4 1/2 years.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, I think we do a lot of stuff today.
SpongeBob: Let's hear it, sir. How are you doing today?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't even keep up with the demand.
SpongeBob: I know what you're saying, Mr. Krabs. I just can't have anything my own way.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know what you're saying. I hope this gives me an idea on how to win right now.
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know what you're saying. I hope this helps.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, well, I don't know what you're saying. I hope this helps.
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know what you're saying. I hope that helps boost my stock in the morning.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, well, bull, bull, bull, bull!
