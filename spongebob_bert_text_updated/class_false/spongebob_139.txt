[It is raining outside.]
Nat: No need to get excited, Sandy. This is going to be great.
Sandy: Great. I'm surrounded by the best out there. What do stand out? What's the big idea?
Nat: Well, I got to say this. This street isn't fancy. It's hot and sweaty.
SpongeBob: 'Tis I, Sandy, the ocean floor.
Sandy: ECHHHH! ECHHHH!
[Sandy is struggling to break even.]
Sandy: OH GRABBIT, ECHHHH! OH GRABBIT! OH GRABBIT! ECHHHH! [gasps] The new 'I'S ON THE MOBILE APP! [SpongeBob sees how the old 'I' is doing, grunting]
SpongeBob: Great, I like the new 'I'.
Sandy: OH GRABBIT, OH GRABBIT! ECHHHH! [SpongeBob is falling backwards, still struggling] The 'I' is... I'm not falling backwards anymore. I'm just... I'm not paying the bills. [drops]
SpongeBob: Aw, that's okay, Sandy. You get the idea.
Sandy: Thanks. Now, where can I get a little more cheese? [SpongeBob lands on top of Sandy's head. SpongeBob looks around] Huh? Where? [sees the pineapple] Oh! [sees Patrick] Hey, buddy! I like your company atmosphere better.
SpongeBob: All right, Sandy, from now on, no disrespect for former teammate. I'll just wear me hat in the workplace.
Sandy: EASIER EASIER EASIER EASIER EASIE-EET! [SpongeBob breaks out of the building, while Patrick is screaming, and onto Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: What's going on around here?
Sandy: [through walkie-talkie] Would you like to speak with our... boss?
Mr. Krabs: [Plankton is walking by, with SpongeBob behind him] I think that you'd like to... Thank you. [chuckles] Stand here, let meagname away. [SpongeBob hides in the machine, and Plankton walks on, with Mr. Krabs staring at him]
SpongeBob: I think you'd like to speak with our... boss.
Plankton: I can manage this machine. But be warned. [looks at his machinery] Beware, my brother.
[Bubble transition]
Patrick: Hey, is this your boss?
SpongeBob: [looks at sign] My name is SpongeBob and this is my Krusty Krab.
Patrick: Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: I live here now.
Patrick: Oh, yeah. My name's SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, this is great. I can finally meet you all. [everyone laughs]
Squidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob, here's your pizza.
SpongeBob: Yeah. I wanted to ask you one thing. Which one time has SpongeBob stopped working?
Squidward: Two.
SpongeBob: And why is he still turning patties?
Squidward: Because he's so bored.
SpongeBob: He's bored... Oh. [turns his head around to show a finger] ...He's... I told him to stop. [grabs a rope with rope attached to it]
Squidward: You britches did it?
SpongeBob: I didn't even get to taste the patties. Sorry, Mr. Squidward, I meant Mr. Squidward.
Squidward: And he... 
SpongeBob: I said he stopped... I didn't mean... 
Squidward: And you stopped by because you wanted to taste the...
SpongeBob: Uh... delicious pizza.
Squidward: And then you went and bought three more Krabby Patties for your friends?
SpongeBob: And who will make one of each?
Squidward: Three! [both run through the kitchen] SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: Right behind you... Hmm... [squeezes behind Squidward]
Squidward: Now there's an easy way to tell. [as he pulls ahead a beat, he walks backwards through the kitchen and crashes into the back of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Found it! Found it again.
Squidward: [grabs the bag] I love Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: They're my favorite thing to do in the world.
