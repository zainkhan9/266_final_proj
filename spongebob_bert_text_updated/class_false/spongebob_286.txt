<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is marching around like a military drill sergeant while wearing an army hat.]
Mr. Krabs: Now, we're really going to go home at any second. Atten down, boy. Trampoline! Trampoline! Trampoline! Trampoline! [turns into foot then starts to walk] Trampoline! Trampoline! Trampoline! [laughs and holds onto Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Trampoline! Trampoline! Trampoline! [trips and falls off the rock and onto the floor]
Mr. Krabs: [through gritted teeth] Gosh, I'm not quite done with that yet.
SpongeBob: Boy, those Krabby Patties sure are hot.
Mr. Krabs: Really!
[SpongeBob climbs on top of Mr. Krabs' head and tramps around on his back.]
SpongeBob: Trampoline!
[Mr. Krabs gets caught on the trampoline's arm and he eats the hot sauce. Mr. Krabs trampoline over to Squidward, but he's not there.]
Squidward: [through binoculars] No, that won't work. Oh, I've got to act fast. Move! [grunts and makes a perfect lunge for the spatula that's blocking the door on his side]
Mr. Krabs: [cuts to Mr. Krabs hiding by using the jet pack on his forehead, and then walking to the Krusty Krab] Sir, you've just asked the whole mud-slide sales department.
[Mr. Krabs is talking to his fellow customers in his head, which is where the blinds are, about where to put the refuges. Krabs picks up one customer and goes to the window.]
Mr. Krabs: I've just got to look. [opens the door to reveal the Krabby Patties at SpongeBob] Hmm, look at this. [grabs the patty and points at it] It's full. [licks it and giggles] Oh, dizzy. Good one, sir. [sets her down and drives out of the Krusty Krab] I hope I don't just cause a riot in the street by tearing up the place. [enters the Krusty Krab and starts taking customers]
Fred: Hey, everybody, come back! [shouts] I had this, too!
Nat: Do no harm, son. [Opens the Krusty Krab and Widow Patty inflates]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] This is the Krusty Krab, sir.
Nat: Here's the Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: It's taken, sadly, his name. But the tradition of the Krusty Krab to eat these two treatables in person. That would be silly. And, frankly, I'm ashamed.
Nat: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: I wish I could fly out of here into the city.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs out of the jet ski outside the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: What does this mean?
Mr. Krabs: It means that tonight, Mr. Squidward, I would like you to meet me lovely, golden self. [closes the door]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Night, Squidward. [goes to sleep]
Squidward: Would you please sleep with my name on it?
[SpongeBob is sleeping. Squidward is awake until the lights turn off. Squidward tries to sleep, but his lights prevent him from sleeping. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Squidward sitting at a table. Squidward is trying to think of a name for something.]
Squidward: [Spoken] What's that?
[SpongeBob sniffs his food. Squidward sits up and wakes up. He looks at his name tag and sees "Johnny Tentacles". He then tries to think of something.]
Squidward: That's my name?
[The scene changes to Squidward finally having enough air in his body to allow for air sucking in his bed.]
Squidward: I've got nothing on a name!
[SpongeBob is shown sleeping and sees a name that looks like Squidward that he has seen in a movie. He sniffs it.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: I'm not a name!
SpongeBob: Well, sometimes I get a name, too.
Squidward:
