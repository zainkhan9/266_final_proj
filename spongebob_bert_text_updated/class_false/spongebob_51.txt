[The episode starts with SpongeBob getting ready for bed. He puts on his work hat, gets in bed and wakes up]
SpongeBob: Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. [He yawns as two tentacle shaped windows appear on his front half of his head] Night be unto him, the sea that hid me, meet me, I give thee a welcome-noon. [A horn honks. SpongeBob's sleeping head goes in the window, but is stopped by an earthworm who sees what he is. The worm wants to eat Patrick, so SpongeBob lifts up his hat but is shocked when he sees Patrick eating his lunchbox breakfast.]
Squidward: Earthworm feed me snail butter. [The worm on the ground gives SpongeBob a piece of his sandwich also gives him a receipt]
SpongeBob: [laughs] That was excellent, Squidward! A rare treat for lunchtime reading. [SpongeBob leans against the window but can't see anything out] Must have gone in. Can't see anything around lantern. Must have had to use window shades. [Lights turn on and he stands up. He mumbles and walks outside his house. Squidward is behind him]
Squidward: Hey, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob steps on him and sees him. He looks up and sees him going to his house through the window] Squidward!
SpongeBob: Reading, isn't it wonderful, Squidward?
Squidward: More like marvelous. Yee-haw, you said it. [Washes Squidward and his bookshelf. Hides in his bed] Ahh.
SpongeBob: You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. [Hits Squidward in the head with his books, Squidward gets up] You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again. You said it again... Squidward!
Squidward: What? What are you...?!
SpongeBob: Squidward, you and I have been talking for hours!
Squidward: I don't want any part of you again!
SpongeBob: I'll bet you never will be able to read this book, Squidward.
Squidward: It is, for I know nothin' else more ignominious than that. And, dare I say it,[finishing intermission] SpongeBob and I down in our first cataloguing of summer reading.
French Narrator: Ahh. Another beautiful day at the Krusty Krab.
Squidward: And, what a fine day!
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, whatcha doing?
Squidward: What if there's one more perfect day, such as today?
SpongeBob: Perfect day? You mean today?
Squidward: Today?
SpongeBob: Perfect day?
Squidward: Perfect day?
SpongeBob: Perfect day?
Squidward: Perfect day?
SpongeBob: Perfect day?
Squidward: Good idea, let me get you a Krabby Patty.
[SpongeBob takes a paper and starts working on it]
French Narrator: Ah, another day at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. What's this?
Squidward: It's another day at the Krusty Krab. I didn't read your order, so I didn't get a Double Krabby Patty, and I didn't get a Double Krabby Patty, so I didn't get a Le Spamo-- oh, my! [SpongeBob tries to read the order again, but Squidward prevented him from doing so]
SpongeBob: Well, good luck with that. I'm gonna have to sit down and think of something to do. [takes a paper from behind his back, Marv reads it, and SpongeBob thinks of it as well. SpongeBob gets a Krabby Patty, eats it and starts crying]
Marv: Give me your perfect Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Really?
Marv: Sure. [Squidward sits on the toilet and SpongeBob is crying]
SpongeBob: Ew, I'm so sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: You know what, SpongeBob? I'm so ashamed of myself. That's why I'm going to give you my gold star.
