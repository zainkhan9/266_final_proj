[The episode begins with SpongeBob, Gladys, Nazz, and the Pretty Patties all walking to the Krusty Krab. Gladys is singing in tune and the Pretty Patties in particular. Gladys notices Squidward, who is chewing on his phone, and the group of Pretty Patties made around them. Gladys grumbles as he notices Mr. Krabs, who is acting as a pirate in his weekly gambling trip.]
Pirate: Wha-ha? Ha! Who's the king? [gibberish]
Mr. Krabs: [wha-ha] Well, that's a little garble's sake. [gibberish]
Pirate: Jerk! [gibberish]
Mr. Krabs: Jerk! [gibberish]
Pirate: KraaAkaAAAgseUsWAAgseUsWAAgseUsWA! [lets go of the steering wheel and straightens out the mustache]
Gale: Hey, what's that?
Pearl: I think that the pineapple looks a lot bigger than it really is.
Gale: Wait, just look at that! [gibberish]
Pirate: Jerk! [gibberish]
Mr. Krabs: Jerk!
Gale: I can't believe it, Mr. Squidward. These losers are so used to it.
Pirate: Look at this! [points at the Krusty Krab with a high percentage of customers eating it]
Mr. Krabs: Customers? What about my employees?
Squidward: Me, too. We're all out.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, so how'd you get over Sandy, old lady?
Pearl: I couldn't believe it, Mr. Krabs. So get off of the premises, bud. [Mr. Krabs takes the money]
Mr. Krabs: So don't, SpongeBob. [Pearl walks off]
Squidward: What did I miss?
Pearl: Forget the pineapple! [Mr. Krabs pushes her even farther, leaving a bicycle tire on her helmet]
Squidward: You can live here forever and ever!
Pearl: Are we getting a mortgage or a loan?
Squidward: No.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Don't you want to live in the moment, laddy? [laughs]
SpongeBob: You get a job, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: How do I get one-upped? [laughs] Do I have toiled around here all day? No. But I got one job out of love. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Will you get a job as soon as I'm gone?
Mr. Krabs: Whatever. [Mr. Krabs makes a rainbow appear]
SpongeBob: That's just one thing. [pokes it but it is not a rainbow] I don't think we can ever replace Gus.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you did win that award, boy. Did you?
SpongeBob: Yes.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you got a little company to round up some old fish for your family feasting.
SpongeBob: [spraying water] Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And did you win that award ever, boy?
SpongeBob: Absolutely.
Mr. Krabs: Well, congratulations, boy-o. Now for one, two, three, four years of your hardy exteriority and my fiery temper.
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't know, Mr. Krabs. That's it. [laughs] I guess me fiery temper put my internal organs through this tub at work. Now, uh, maybe you're wondering... oh, well, this isn't my glamorous exterior, it's this fancy purple department store. Do I really have to wear a department store bra?
Mr. Krabs: That's a no-good-evil slogan, eh, Squidward?
Squidward: Beautiful, vibrant, warm, and welcoming. [picks him up and laughs] What can I get ya?
Mr. Krabs: Just till your ex-partitioner gets homennng back to health.
