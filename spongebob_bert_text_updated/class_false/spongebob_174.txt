[The episode opens with SpongeBob and Patrick at the Krusty Krab serving our food.]
SpongeBob: Here's your burger, sir. [hands the burger to Patrick]
Patrick: Here's mine, what are your picks?
SpongeBob: I've got a pickle!
[Patrick gives SpongeBob his soda.]
Patrick: Here's yours.
SpongeBob: I want a Krabby Patty right now!
Patrick: Oh. Patty.
SpongeBob: Here's your burger.
Patrick: Here's your burger.
SpongeBob: [holds out his walkie-talkie] Where do you want it?
Patrick: How about...
[Patrick gives SpongeBob his walkie-talkie.]
SpongeBob: [cheering] How do you like it, Mr. Director?
Director: I love it. [Patrick gives SpongeBob his walkie-talkie.]
SpongeBob: [Patrick gives walkie-talkie again] How do you like it?
Director: Like what?
SpongeBob: I cant remember.
SpongeBob: [talking to his talkie] Well, the Krabby Patty, fresh from the barnacles, your daily routine, without the cubicles, the drive thru, and the enclosed courtyard.
Director: And where does he get all that Krabby Patty goodness?
SpongeBob: He gets it from the chimney of his day. Taking the call. Spreading the word. Bargaining. Bargaining. [speaking the talkie] Bargaining. [speaking the talkie] Bargaining. Bargaining. [speaking the talkie] Bargaining. [speaking the talkie] Not enough yelling, my little fellow-skool. What do ya think? About this call? Do you have enough for the whole gamut? [speaking the talkie] Well, I'd better go somewhere else. I cant' stand the little, yellow, hairy guy.
[the scene cuts to the Bikini Atoll]
Man Ray: Hey, you do this on a weekly basis? [speaking the talkie] It kills me. [speaking the talkie] All you got is me issue one bad call and you don't even have time to respond to my every call.
[SpongeBob walks up to Patrick]
SpongeBob: Hello, Patrick.
Patrick: Um... hello.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Who said that?
Patrick: I'm sorry, I don't understand.
SpongeBob: How many times do we have to tell you we're sorry for your shenanigans, sir?
Patrick: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: How many times do we have to tell you? I'm sorry!
Patrick: What are you talking about?
SpongeBob: [annoyed] I'm sorry!
Patrick: What's that?
SpongeBob: I want you to talk!
Patrick: How many times do we have to tell you?!
SpongeBob: How many times do we have to tell you?!
Patrick: How many times do we have to tell you?!
SpongeBob: What are you talking about?
Patrick: I'm talking about polite delinquent!
SpongeBob: [annoyed] I'm talking about kindER!
Patrick: [annoyed] How many times do we have to tell you?!
SpongeBob: How many times do we have to tell you?!
