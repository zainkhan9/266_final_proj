SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Patrick: Oh, boy! Let's go get some refreshments.
Squidward: Are you done with those earlier?
SpongeBob: Hmm... [turns around and looks at his watch] Huh? [turns around and looks at his watch] Oh! I'll have to come back early. [trips over Squidward, running all over the place, and gets himself tangled in the tree's branches] Arrgh! [groans] Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: Give me that! What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward, hello. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: What now?
SpongeBob: There's gotta be something we can do.
Squidward: Something...you said?
SpongeBob: I think I know what it is.
Squidward: Aww...
[SpongeBob runs off and Squidward continues running until he reaches the back of the dumpster. He looks from where he can grab the key. He then gets out a long tube of toothpaste]
Squidward: Here's the key!
SpongeBob: Thank you.
Squidward: Oh, boy. [jumps out of the dumpster and gets himself tangled in the tree's branches] Arrgh! [groans as he falls off the tree and continues running] I gotta do something.
SpongeBob: Okay, then. I'm it! [runs over to the finish line] SpongeBob! [runs over to the finish line and runs around the edge of the tree, flailing his arms and legs. He eventually gets the key and he runs across the finish line. He then flails his arms and legs and starts running. SpongeBob finishes first in the coliseum and then in the stadium. He then climbs up the ladder and reaches the top] Oh no! [sees Patrick] Oh no there! [sees Squid] Oh no there! [sees Sandy] I must have done it! I got to have the key to Patrick's secret formula! [sees SpongeBob, who is beginning to get tired] SpongeBob, you are a true friend. Do you understand?
Squidward: [he gets in his boat and begins walking towards Patrick] No.
[Squidward stops walking towards Patrick. Patrick's eyes begin to water up and he gets angry. He throws the key bars out at Squidward. He throws a soda can next. He throws a trash can next. He throws a boot on Squidward. He even gives him a neck tattoo]
Squidward: Now, you get to talk to Patrick about this! First, I'm gonna have to talk to Patrick about Patrick. [he starts grilling and Patrick continues to freak out at him] [unintelligible] Patrick! What the...?
Patrick: Why, SpongeBob, I'm not stupid! I'm just a regular guy!
SpongeBob: Well, can we talk about that later?
[Squidward starts jeering him and start's jumping up and down all confused. Then he starts hitting himself and his head appears to be shaking.]
Squidward: You seem to be missing the point. Encino's the new normal! The city's been running out of life! It's time you fell back to Squidward!
[Squidward's angry mob starts to gather around SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: But, Squidward, the people think that's cool! They think they know me! [tries to hide himself, but SpongeBob pulls him] Sorry, Squidward, but I don't believe in normal!
[As SpongeBob walks around with a cork, a screw, and a stick in his mouth, Squidward starts hanging himself]
Squidward: All right, normal. But who's in charge? [SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other and continue laughing] They say that when you are in charge, you become norm... [SpongeBob removes the cork] ...norm...
[A spotlight can be seen above the Coliseum, giving an extra dimension to the Coliseum. SpongeBob's background now appears closer to the two]
SpongeBob: Who are you?
[SpongeBob's shadow adjusts its grip on the anchor, making it look like a cannon is going around it. The anchor bounces back and forth, making it look like it's floating]
Squidward: Okay, normal. But who's in charge?
SpongeBob: I am in
