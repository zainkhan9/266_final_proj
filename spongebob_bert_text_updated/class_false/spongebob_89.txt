[Episode starts on another day at the Krusty Krab. Squidward is playing his clarinet badly, singing while eating popcorn.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] How 'bout another day of Double Fine?
[The Krusty Krab closes itself up and SpongeBob yelps as he leaves.]
Mr. Krabs: I better give that boy a hug. [The plaque deigns to open] Today ends at krabbypawn. I thought I told you to go work today.
[Squidward sadly walks out of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob pops out of SpongeBob's uniform.]
SpongeBob: But, sirâ€”
Squidward: Sorry. [Squidward walks away] You know, this isn't the first time that a Squidward decoration has crossed his mind.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Sorry, Squidward.
[The scene changes to show Tina Fey sitting on the toilet grinder doing her oral narration for Scooter's Scooter: The Life of Squidward. SpongeBob grumbles at himself while his eyelids are shaking. He sits up. His body starts to dry out.]
SpongeBob: I don't get it.
Tina Fey: Hey, you didn't just stumble onto the floor.
[The scene shows a wide shot. Tina Fey walks up to SpongeBob.]
Tina Fey: Are you here for the oral report?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob's body starts to dry as if he's partially eaten.] No.
Tina Fey: Then sign here.
[The Tina Fey translator handpoints SpongeBob with her tongue. SpongeBob signs the form.]
[The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs' house. SpongeBob is dressed as a suit. The costume has the head of a horse. SpongeBob is seen wearing a suit and Mr. Krabs' body. SpongeBob walks in.]
Mr. Krabs: Come on. Why didn't you just say so in the card?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Because I don't want to get eaten.
[SpongeBob gets annoyed at Mr. Krabs' stupidity. As more of his body dry, SpongeBob moves to painting on Mr. Krabs' chest. This gives him an idea on how to treat his own debt.]
SpongeBob: I'm gonna have to go up and get these paintings.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, alrighty then. Good luck. [Mr. Krabs' head becomes clear and he starts to angry.] Well, you see, I wanted to make sure Mr. Krabs had his paintings cleaned and dried out.
SpongeBob: Yes, I know. [Mr. Krabs gets an idea.] Okay, little guy, uh, of course I'll want to wash and care for the sick, but for the most part, those elderly and the infirm, clean and germinal?
Mr. Krabs: Hmm...
[Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob ahead and presents himself as a health care worker at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob gets along with Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir. I like you.
Mr. Krabs: [stops SpongeBob] This sounds perfect. 'Tis a way to get customers and a way to get you a job. Look at me, I'm the health inspector in Needon Barn. I can fix any problem I have, anytime. Now let's see what he does with those sick people. [SpongeBob walks away] Oh, I love this place too. Call me. [walks away] Oh, goin' after my hat. Look at me, I'm a bit of a dirty fighter. [switches to a civilian life insurance picture] I'm a bit of a dirty fighter. [SpongeBob walks away] Oh, I hate to tell you this, old man, but you're taking on too much of the ordinary. Let's take a little walk, maybe even rule some of them. [SpongeBob walks away] Ah-ah-ah, a-a-at all. [walking through the bush] Howling and wailing... [SpongeBob stops and stares for a moment, then smiles] Howling and wailing... [laughs] Howling and wailing... [laughs] ...and listening to him. [SpongeBob breathes in deeply] Oh, SpongeBob. Howling and wailing... [SpongeBob looks out the window and see burning toenails] ...and howling and wailing... [SpongeBob walks out] Oh, look, I almost got myself an eyestalk.
