[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is declining SpongeBob's proposition.]
Mr. Krabs: I ain't pickin' 'em up. They go to work!
[Mr. Krabs makes a satisfied sound. The two walk away. The scene changes to show Squidward's head. The scene changes to show SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob pops his head out of the window. SpongeBob looks at his watch.]
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know if I'm getting paid or unpaid.
[SpongeBob runs back to the table.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what do you think Mr. Krabs is,?
Mr. Krabs: That depends, uh... who.
[Mr. Krabs looks at his watch and chuckles.]
Mr. Krabs: What do you think, boy? Do you want to work for me?
SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs is for you right. I'll take any contract you want.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, boy. I can give you anything I want.
SpongeBob: No, don't you think that's me discriminating?
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Well, you can ask me.
SpongeBob: Well, I wanna be able to give you all your belongings.
Mr. Krabs: Well, okay.
[Mr. Krabs looks at his belongings, takes out a pickle and puts it in his pocket.]
SpongeBob: Okay, bye.
Squidward: SpongeBob, you can't give me all your stuff. I can't give you all your stuff. That's what me and your stuff are for.
SpongeBob: Me and your me stuff?
Squidward: Yeah. Yeah.
SpongeBob: And your me stuff.
Squidward: Yeah.
SpongeBob: And my me stuff.
Squidward: Yeah.
[SpongeBob runs off. The scene changes to show Fred in his home playing his clarinet. Screams stops. He turns on the music.]
Fred: Blecor!
Squidward: [Walks out of his house] SpongeBob! Come on. I got to get back home. Ow! [Walks over to the lifeguard tower] Hey, your lifeguard says I want to talk to you.
[The lifeguard turns on the music and points to SpongeBob on it. SpongeBob gasps and the lifeguard pushes him to the wall and hits the table. The lifeguard reveals that the last thing on his desk was actually his desk. He winks then turns on the music.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh. Sorry. SpongeBob, I need you to...
SpongeBob: hand over the desk.
Squidward: Never mind! It's just desk, nothing to do but get to work.
[SpongeBob struggles to reach but can't reach up to the lifeguard, who chuckles]
SpongeBob: I see you have a hand in...
[The lifeguard hands SpongeBob a bag of his stuff and SpongeBob picks it up. SpongeBob gasps and the lifeguard throws it at SpongeBob. The bag of stuff lands on Squidward's face. Squidward gets up and grimaces. The lifeguard gets tighter and tighter until he can't hold his stuff together anymore. The lifeguard pinpoints his finger to his mouth and his eyes show. The lifeguard pushes his finger to the lifeguard's forehead and shows his finger for what it is. The lifeguard pushes his finger out from behind his neck and down to his wrist. The lifeguard's wrist then turns back and his eyes become bloodshot.]
SpongeBob: You're it! [runs over to the lifeguard] You're it! [SpongeBob shoots SpongeBob's arm open. The lifeguard's arm falls through and lands on the lifeguard's screaming.] Uhh... got it! [The lifeguard's screaming makes it appear that the lifeguard was hit by SpongeBobâ€™s clarinet. The scene changes to the next morning. We see SpongeBob still running around and screaming. He runs over to the lifeguard and pokes him; the lifeguard takes SpongeBob's clarinet out of his head] You're it! [The scene changes to show the lifeguard with SpongeBob's plate] You're it!
