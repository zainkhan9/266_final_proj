<Start Ep> <3
[Episode starts at Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob and Patrick are running along the shore in their bathing suits. SpongeBob takes a photo of himself doing the bath and Patrick takes a picture of himself showering, then he is diving into a ball of gum and absorbs it then he holds up his new photo. He puts the photo in the camera and rolls it to the back of a boat. He gets so scared that his face turns into Plankton's face. Plankton is then seen driving his driving boat in the background.]
Plankton: Why, thank you very much. [drives away]
SpongeBob: Bye, Grandma.
Grandma Plankton: I'm driving a boat. All I see is nice, old lady.
SpongeBob: Aw, thanks, Grandma. [drives away]
Plankton: No, SpongeBob. No, no, no. I mean, [drives straight to the Krusty Krab] a nice old lady like you who drives...
Mr. Krabs: Hey, get in line! [gasps and makes a weird sound]
Squidward: I can't. I don't have a present. [drives through the kitchen, driving into the front doors, then drives inside. The scene changes to show the scene where Patchy is walking out of the Krusty Krab with a present. He makes a racket with his fingernails.] Well, here I am. [he jumps inside the kitchen with a Krabby Patty behind him] I'm gonna get mine when I'm... [slips on the Patty, loses his index finger, and yelps] My thumb!
Patchy: Oh, shrimp. Where'd you get this trident?
Mr. Krabs: They put it in my back pocket.
Patchy: Shrimp. You lost me back? Oh, shrimp!
Mr. Krabs: Well, back there, me old oyster. You always wanted to have a shrimp.
[Mr. Krabs rubs his index finger on the side of his nose. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs' house. He opens the window and sees a clam eating a patty. It stops in front of him, and Mr. Krabs gets his patty inside.]
Mr. Krabs: [whispering] Hold on there, me Mr. Krabs. I can't have a patty with...
[The clam stops in front of Mr. Krabs. It lifts up a Krabby Patty and gives it to the customer. The customer eats the patty.]
Mr. Krabs: And this is my patty! [The clam pulls the string and the customer is left with a smelly Patty. Mr. Krabs rubs his index finger on the side of his head. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs in a wheelchair. He puts the Krabby Patty on the table and pokes one of his holes. He shoves it in the patty.] Okay, you want fries?
Mr. Krabs: "No fries." [laughs] "No money." [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs goes into a trance. He goes to a mirror, looks at his watch, reads the newspaper, and gets up. He then goes into his office and holds his thoughts together with the tape he just claps his hands. The thought bubble disappears and Mr. Krabs starts to remember.]
Mr. Krabs: [in his office] Huh? [sees the patty and gasps] Huh? [laughs] What the? [gasps] No! No! [laughs] No! [gasps] Oh, oh, no! [climbs a ladder and reaches the top of the dome] Oh, I'll get some cheese! [grabs some cheese] Here! [takes a brioche cork and slips it under the scanner's cork. The brioche falls and hits Mr. Krabs in the face. The Bikini Bottomites gasp in shock as Mr. Krabs facepalms himself in the dining room.] Huh? [sees the patty] Huh? [laughs]
[The patty falls on the ground and Mr. Krabs grabs it. The Bikini Bottomite jumps on the patty and pours it in his belly button. The feisty pelican wail is heard.]
Mr. Krabs: [crying] Gross! [sobs] The patty went in my belly and I was able to rub it in there, I guess? [holds it in his belly]
Bikini Bottomite: And I like Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's just like a Krabby Patties...
Bikini Bottomite: And you like my service!
Mr. Krabs: Well
