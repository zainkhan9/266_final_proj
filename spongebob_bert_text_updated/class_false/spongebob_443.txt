[The scene switches to SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: And Patrick, we're back.
[SpongeBob walks over to Squidward's house and notices the same fish sleeping under his rock.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward.
Squidward: [gets really angry] You're not going to get your armpit waxed like me, are you? Oh, why, SpongeBob. How am I supposed to enjoy living next to great masterpiece? [gets drenched on by his armpit wax]
[SpongeBob notices his armpit wax falls off, so he hides in his pants.]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Squidward, I thought your armpit wax would protect you from my wax.
Squidward: No, that's not what I said.
SpongeBob: Well, then, we'll just growl louder. [lowers his his armpit wax by using a louder voice] Okay, Squidward, that's enough.
[Squidward shrinks back of his head and his pants rip off.]
SpongeBob: Whew! That was loud.
[SpongeBob hyperventilates himself until his antennae begins to fly up and down like balloons. He floats to a high-sea surf spot and lands on top of a coral rock. He feeds on the coral rock and lands on the coral rock's surface, he gets off balance and uses a TennisBall topoke at Squidward. He gets under Squidward's leg and uses the back of his tongue topoke at him. Squidward falls down.]
Squidward: [gets slapped by Squidward] Stop it! Stop! [gets slapped by Patrick] Oh, Patrick, stop it! [gets slapped by SpongeBob again] Stop it! Stop!
[Patrick catapults SpongeBob and Squidward up into the air. Squidward slides around and gets himself tangled in the coral rock's coral. Squidward falls into a cabinet and SpongeBob hears something building up in the background.]
Patrick: You're coming in too fast on the remote. [observes the remote] Hit it, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob takes control of the submarine and spins around like a rocket. He jumps out of the cabinet and hits the interior of the cabinet. He turns on his remote and gets the remote's key. He opens the cabinet and gets inside, knocking over several items. The submarine enters a large metal box, which falls over on top of Squidward. SpongeBob hears this from behind.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, open up! The real Sponge!
[SpongeBob jumps out of the box, takes out a key chain, and opens the box. It reveals to be Gary.]
SpongeBob: Gary? [gets shocked] Oh, no! No, no, no! [takes the key chain and gets in front of Squidward] P-P-P-P-Squidward! [cries Squidward and his house bursts through the door with a bell; Squidward escapes and blasts SpongeBob with his submarine]
SpongeBob: Squidward! [knocks the door] He's gonna come back! [tries to get out, but is kicked to the back] Oh!
Squidward: Do you have to do it? Anything to keep him out of my hair! [SpongeBob's hair begins to grow longer and longer; Squidward growls in anger] Ha-ha! Have you got what it takes? Someone with your special gifts for speaking out? Somebody who can talk to people. Someone who can sell your things?
[Camera Flash and Sound Effect causes Squidward to blow bubbles into his nose]
SpongeBob: Well, Squidward, let's just say we're excited about his chance to show off his talents.
[camera zooms to show Mr. Krabs, laughing]
Mr. Krabs: I can't stop laughing. Some people need me to do everything.
SpongeBob: Well, okay. You need your friends.
[Squidward is tickled]
Dr. Marmalade: And now, the most requested ending.
Squidward: What?! Why would I want to spend quality time with you?
Dr. Marmalade: Because we're brilliant.
[Squidward is tickled]
Mermaid Leader: And careful what you wish, for it is found the only living mermaid who has the will. And it is this will that you are worthy of visiting the Royal Jelly.
Dr. Marmalade: Oh, I see what you're trying to do, SpongeBob. What you're trying to do is make yourself famous. I don't care who it is you're making famous, and I don't care what you think! Now get to
