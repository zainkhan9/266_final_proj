[The episode starts with a cameraman walking on his lunch break. He catches fish that are lying on the floor in front of Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.]
Sandy: What's today and what are you doing?
[The cameraman comes back and sees the floor. He freaks out and throws his body on the floor. He notices there is food in the floor and gets worried.]
Sandy: Food? What food did you eat today?
SpongeBob: [His face is all distorted and his eyes become wide and angry] Food, food, food! It's me, SpongeBob! [He jumps into the kitchen and they start making Krabby Patties.]
Mr. Krabs: Now what are we going to do, girls?
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob start making Krabby Patties in the kitchen.]
Sandy: I'm gonna need more help!
[Mr. Krabs makes a huge army of robotic arms and pretends to knock people over.]
Sandy: Uh, shrimp!
[Mr. Krabs grabs some of the arms.]
Sandy: Uh, shrimp!
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Boys, do you have more money?
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs working at the Chum Bucket. It's said to be the most exciting job in the world.]
Mr. Krabs: Now, now, don't get me wrong. I love working here. I've got so many ideas. I can't leave now.
[He happily runs off-screen. The scene changes to show Squidward in a boxing glove outfit. He tries to fight.]
Squidward: Roundabout, square one takes a minute.
[The crowd gasps, then cheers. Squidward falls to the ground and starts to shake and scream. He then starts to transform into a cringing, meat crushing bully.]
Squidward: No, I haven't been knocking anyone's head, this is my head, not your head!
[All of a sudden, an airplane-shaped head with a torso, carapace, and barrel jumps out of the plane.]
SpongeBob: Well, it sure has scared the shit out of me people. How about, uhh, Sandy, do you have a little baby head?
Sandy: Well, uhh, Babysitters Bunny.
SpongeBob: [turns into a baby] Babysitters bunny?
Sandy: Yeah. [laughs]
[Sandy throws a tantrum and cries. Suddenly, SpongeBob becomes the object of the tantrum, turning into a baby head and crying. He turns back into his normal form.]
SpongeBob: Aw, I'm sorry, I couldn't be so busy saving faces! [sobs] I'll try to save people as long as I go to work!
[Patrick walks up.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
[Patrick sobs while SpongeBob sobs. They wind up walking to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob comes up with a scheme to steal Patrick's money. SpongeBob's face changes into Patrick's face and he gives a disgusted look to Patrick's face. The scene changes to SpongeBob going to the Chum Bucket with an evil grin on his face. Patrick is behind him.]
Patrick: Hmm? Hm. [Patrick looks behind him and Patrick's face appears behind him] Huh? No, Patrick! Help!
[Patrick grabs an umbrella, cucumbers, and mops the floor. He then goes inside the Chum Bucket with a sign that says SpongeBob is There And How About: SpongeBob?]
Patrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
[Patrick falls and spits out the Krabby Patty.]
Patrick: Oh, yeah! [Patrick eats the patty and a part of the Krabby Patty falls on his face] Argh!
[Patrick runs off. SpongeBob enters the Chum Bucket and spins in mid-air. He hops on top of Patrick and goes in his head.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick.
Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob? How's my turn?
SpongeBob: Uhh, yeah, sure.
Patrick: Say no to all your weirdities, Your Highness. [giggles and starts running]
[Patrick starts to lose consciousness.]
Patrick: Oh, it's nothing, I'm too crazy for my own good. [giggles]
SpongeBob: Ha! Stay back, you fool! I'm warning you!
[Patrick gets up and runs out. SpongeBob and Patrick start dating again.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Say, what is that horrible smell? [Patrick's stomach growls]
Patrick: I don't know. That
