[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [gasps] My the new the Krusty Krab. Who can say, but it'll be great!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't say either.
SpongeBob: Well, that's what I said.
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's brilliant.
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: What is?
Mr. Krabs: Your spatula's a little slow, boy.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I know! don't you think you're just too sensitive?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Don't be such a stick in the eye, Squidward. Stick in me hole! Look at me! [takes out a tape measure and spits it on Squidward] Oh, you're just trying toâ€”[takes it off] Screw it, I'm not letting go of that spatula! [stomps on it] Now this should do [it back to the edge] what it came from.
Squidward: Don't touch that! [punches SpongeBob and runs away]
SpongeBob: I don't know what you're talking about, Squidward. I don't want to go to SpongeBob's party!
Squidward: Don't you want to go to my party?
Mr. Krabs: No, I just want to go to my dressing-room jump. [attempts to throw SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: [groans] Oh, well. I guess I won't be needing you anymore. [throws the spatula] Come to Papa! [motorcycle motor drives by]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] I thought I told him to drive.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, Mr Krabs! You still need a license.
Mr. Krabs: No, no, this time I got you covered. [laughs]
SpongeBob: D'oh! [stomps on Mr. Krabs, knocking down his license plate] Mr. Krabs! [door is pushed up by a robot] Are you okay? [robotic pushes the plate up to the Krusty Krab] Whoa! [Robo pushes plate up to the front doors] Whoa! [door falls down] Whoa! [door rises up] Whoa! [door falls down] Whoa! [door falls down]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Hey, you always go out.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: You know, boy-o, sometimes, I just forget how much I really love home. [Squidward's house is on top of a waterfall. Fish ride on water beam]
SpongeBob: Squid-ward, if you were here right now, you'd know. [Squidward is walking] I'm such a sea-dog. [SpongeBob breathes in and out like a helicopter]
Squidward: Oh, come on, SpongeBob. Give me a break.
[Bubble transition to the front of Squidward's house. Squidward is writing on a notepad]
Squidward: Okay. What's today?
SpongeBob: Today's... [holds up the "T. Rex" sign]
Squidward: Hey, it's Squilliam.
SpongeBob: Squilliam's a great man.
Squilliam: What do you want?
SpongeBob: Well, now that I've got Squilliam, I want him to make my songs.
Squilliam: That's what you say.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Bring it in, Squilliam!
Squilliam: What's going on?
SpongeBob: I got a call in the newspaper, and...
Squidward: [Scene bubbles over] Will Smith? Oh, please, don't do that.
SpongeBob: Oh, please, don't do that! Stop calling it Squilliam!
Squilliam: What the...
SpongeBob: What?!?
Squidward: It's Squilliam. He's chopping up my music.
SpongeBob: Oh, why are you so afraid to report me?
Squidward: Why do you keep doing it?
SpongeBob: I know it's you.
Squidward: Then stop it! [types] Stop calling me Squilliam!
SpongeBob: You know, I'd love to.
Squidward: Well, what do you want?
SpongeBob: Well, what do you want? [
