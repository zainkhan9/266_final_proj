[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick skipping down a path with cucumbers]
SpongeBob: Marco! Marco! [The scene returns to Patrick] Marco! [The scene returns to SpongeBob] Marco! [The scene returns to Patrick] Marco!
[As the two say the word Marco, the light from their mouths transforms into the acorn-lightens Kraken. He flies past them and SpongeBob and Patrick. We fade back to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Marco! [The scene returns to SpongeBob] Marco! Marco!
[SpongeBob runs into the air with his foot sticking out. SpongeBob tries to hit it, but misses. Then SpongeBob jumps into the air still sticking his toe. Then he screams "Krabs!"]
Patrick: SpongeBob, I've got a conditionovagant infection!
SpongeBob: [He screams, and runs into an air duct on the second floor of the Krusty Krab. Then he runs into an old lady's house. Then he runs into a house with two fishes standing on it. Then he runs into a boy's pool. Then he runs into a children's area. Then he comes out wearing a baseball uniform and a hat.]
Old Lady: Krabby Patties, please!
SpongeBob: But I've gotta take the Krusty Krab home. And this lady's got to go there first.
Old Lady: Then I don't get a way with you.
[she does, and SpongeBob falls out of the ceiling and onto the ground, screaming]
Patrick: SpongeBob,
SpongeBob: Marco! Marco! [Patrick runs into the air] Marco! [The scene returns to Marco and SpongeBob] Marco!
Marco: What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: I don't know, old man.
Marco: He's... um... not going anywhere. He's making his way back to the Krusty Krab. He's never going to get back home, ever.
SpongeBob: [walks off] All right, Marco, but I'm scared.
Marco: No, I'm not.
SpongeBob: I know. I just have to stay here and... [halts as a rock falls on him] Marco! [hangs up. The scene returns to Patrick] Okay, this here is showing you how lucky you are. You can actually hitch a ride on my back. [touches Marco's back] Now, get on with it.
Marco: [yawning] My back.
SpongeBob: [yawning] See you later, my deans tell me.
Marco: [jumps off the rock] Now, Marco, you're a miracle worker. [Marco's back cracks and splinters bugle like cheese, and they spill out into the hallway] So, what do you think?
SpongeBob: [walks over to Patrick] I don't know. Be careful.
Patrick: I'm warning you, SpongeBob. I'm a miracle worker.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's funny. I... uhh. [Marco's back cracks and splinters some more splintery. Then, the door to Patrick's house breaks free] Patrick?
Patrick: [runs over there] What's the holdup, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I know it! Ready to go home, Patrick? [hanging on the rock] Marco! [touches Patrick's back. SpongeBob pulls Patrick and goes back to the door] Marco!
Marco: [chuckles nervously. SpongeBob follows suit. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, where we see that there are two tables with two patties on the top table. There are two soda sodas on the table, one large and small , and two small sodas that are in the customer's aisle. Marco takes a order]
Marco: Yeah, I like you more. [flushes the refill jug with iced tea] Ooh, smooth. [shows a mug of ice tea]
SpongeBob: That's not your badge, Marco. [takes the drink] I'll have that. [drinks it]
Marco: Nice.
SpongeBob: [drinks more] That's not badge... [drinks another] icing. [drinks another] icing on the cake.
Marco: That's good. I'm gonna take this. [takes another sip of his iced tea. SpongeBob gulps and starts to cry]
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, come back!
Patrick: I can't, SpongeBob. I can't go to work. I'm late for the Junior Divin' Job!
SpongeBob: Oh, I've
