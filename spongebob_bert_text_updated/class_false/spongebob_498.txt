[The episode begins with a storybook entitled "The End". The camera zooms into a picture of a Chinese woman who has just given a giant burp to her chair. The scene fades to a wide shot of a baby fish who blows bubbles]
Woman: Whoo! Who wants a big bubble, Daddy?
Daughter: I'll have a big bubble for Daddy. [big bubble pops]
Big Bubble: Yeah!
Woman: Who wants a baby bubble, Daddy?
Daughter: I want a baby bubble that everyone can own, Daddy Daddy. [big bubble pops, squirt in her eyes]
[A medium wide shot of two people with their eyeballs out of dynamite is shown.]
Nurse: Doctor?
D.M.T.C.: Sorry, honey, but our testing is so precise, there's no way we can make a convincing argument.
Nurse: You don't even have the talent, do you? Just brilliant
D.M.T.C.: Yes, I could name some people who have it. [points to a man with the cod hairpiece]
Woman: Oh, that's just brilliant!
Fish #2: No!
Nat: Oh, it's so hard to make!
Fish #3: We're all in it together, Nat! [both laugh]
Nat: Now, what are we going to do now?
Fish #2: Let's save the town!
Nat: No, no, get back! [both run off]
Nat: Go to work, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob knocks on Squidward's door and Squidward answers it] 7300E-B, 7300E-B, 7300E-B, has just got started.
Squidward: [Walking out of the doctor's office] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! It's too late! [wife starts crying] I will never have anything like this, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob knocks on her door]
SpongeBob: Yes, hello. How are you here?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I am here...to- serve you. [SpongeBob knocks on the door again]
SpongeBob: Here ya go, Squidward! [SpongeBob goes into the kitchen] Enjoy my kitchen! [SpongeBob then enters another room where the prisoners are sleeping and knock on the doors]
Wa-tay: What are you doing here?
Wa-tay: No, I am serving...
Janitor: Me too!
Janitor #2: What's going on here?
Janitor #2: The door is too wide.
Janitor #1: Let's get out of here.
Janitor #2: Let's get out of here! [both jump out the door] Happy Leif Eriksen!
Janitor #1: I hope not, Mr. House.
Janitor #2: We don't have much time. Come back here, whenever you like!
Janitor #1: Let's get stuck.
Janitor #2: Let's get stuck. [both jump out the door again and SpongeBob walks into a room full of blank black urchins]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. Isn't there anything else we can do?
Squidward: Oh, yes. I think I know this. I'm stuck. [puts on a panel and the lights go dark]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi. I can't see. Don't worry, Squidward. I can fix it. [moves the panel and the lights turn on and reveals a long line of people. They are in a prisoner's prison] I can't see. Don't worry, Squiddy. I can fix it. [moves a large painting of a rabbit on the wall] I can fix it. [sticks his eyestalk through the opening and points to the one on the wall] I can fix it!
Squidward: Hey, who's the one with knitted pants?
SpongeBob: That's me, SpongeBob, he's the one with SpongePants.
Squidward: Hey! Where's that one coming from?
SpongeBob: Hey! PATRICK! Where's that papa?
Patrick: That one's coming from... [Both pull their attention back to Patrick] from... at the Bikini Bottom Jail!
SpongeBob: PATRICK! You can't escape!
Patrick: [pulls his eyes out through his mouth] From Bikini Bottom, at the Galleria [hits the air] or in the bathroom!
Both: Galleria [both scream] at the Bikini Bottom Jail!
Patrick: [both jump into the water]
