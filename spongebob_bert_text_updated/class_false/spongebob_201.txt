[The episode begins with Debbie relaxing on a bench in front of her rock.]
Debbie: I'm sure it's so, don't I?
[A fish walks up and she and the fish both laugh. The episode ends with Patrick struggling with a brush on his head.]
Narrator: Epilogue.
[The Krusty Krab: Attention, shoppers, it's storm time in Bikini Bottom. So much so, that customers are now reclining all night with pillows, mattresses, and newspapers. [A woman sits in her spot]
Nat: I never thought I'd say this,, but I love storm clouds.
Pilar: Let's take a look. [She has a large stack of cash on her lap from her paycheck, reading a note]
Nat: It's default. [She gets a raspberry] Later.
Pilar: Where are we, uhh, honey?
[Nat alternates between the two "Default"]
Debbie: What the...? [She has a whale voice recorder]
Debbie: Uhh, honey, this is storm time in Bikini Bottom. [Debbie puts the recorder away, listening to the whale music from the radio] Let's hear it. [she puts on her Krusty Krab hat and throws it on the ground, some making noises and some screams. She goes to put the recorder in her mouth, but almost gets it stuck in her nose. The recorder spins around in the air and goes haywire, going haywire towards the recorder. She puts her Krusty Krab hat on and goes back to sleep. The episode abruptly stops.]
Gary: Uhh, honey, I'm storming home. [Gary tries to open his head, but it isn't possible] I'm storming back. [Gary tries again, this time on his head, but it's not possible] I'm storming my castle! [He comes back into his normal form, and starts throwing random items at Gary. He then gets smashed between his rock and head. Gary looks at the broken Krusty Krab head-first.]
Gary: [As Gary throws random items at Gary] "Uhhh... can I have your Krabby Patty?" "Have I been kind to your wife?" [Gary starts crying]
Gary: [normal voice] NO!
SpongeBob: Gary! Look out for that monster!
[Cut to SpongeBob with his eyes on the monster's monster-like head]
SpongeBob: I've got a monster. Yes, I've got a monster. [The head continues walking until it bumps into a rock, which it bumps into] NO! [SpongeBob screams] He's not going down! [SpongeBob screams again] I'm not going down! [SpongeBob gets hit by the monster's monster-like head]
Monster: [Now wearing a torture device, a nose like that of a drifter, and a shape-like figure] You're not going down!
SpongeBob: I'm not down?
Monster: No. I'm going down into Bikini Bottom and I want to see the beauty of the Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: I'm down in the back yard?
Monster: No. And I'm going to take you there! [He pulls the monster's head out of the monster's mouth and bares his teeth. The monster starts to walk with his feet.]
SpongeBob: Wow! [With one other instrument, the handle of which is a jack-in-the-box falls off] Oh... [He uses his clarinet as a squirt gun, raining bullets at the monster. The monster dodges the bullets.] I am it! I am it! I am it! I am it!
[With the monster, SpongeBob bounces around as a broken record again. The broken record shows the monster in the record book being able to walk on water. A beam of light falls off the broken record, breaking the monster record. The monster continues walking on water]
Dwarf: Huh? Hey, hey. Hey, hey. [Strangler walks off-screen and reappears under a nearby rock, singing while sitting on the ground]
Strangler: Ta-da! [Strangler's feet hit the ground, and he flies away.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Monster, here you go, tubby twervers. [He chuckles and floats to the ground, sobbing. The monster in the record book is destroyed, too. ]
[CHAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!]
Strangler: [screams and jumps with all his might as the water level in the record book immediately increases. Eventually, the monster's water body starts to take water]
Water Monster: Water Warbler, you have left the entire town in my
