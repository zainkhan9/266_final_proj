<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins with the clam migration.]
French Narrator: Ahh, a peaceful migration here on Earth. But is it time for Le Pew to begin?
[Le Pew coughs his shoulders and goes back into his house. But the door closes after him. He knocks on the door again and locks it immediately.]
Le Pupinus Complulerfish: You wait here. [Le Pupinus guards the door.]
[Le Pupinus enters the room.]
Le Pupinus: I will commence the Feast of Le Pupus now.
[Le Pupus starts sweating with exhaustion. His pupils turn from a blue to a green to a blue to a green. His pupils gradually turn from a green to a blue to a red. Le Pupus peaks through the window and starts to wail.]
[Le Pupus grabs a mallet, pokes it and uses it as a mallet. He wails in victory. Le Pupus launches into the air and rolls into Fred's house, popping both of them. It immediately makes its mark out of Fred's house on to the floor.]
Fred: Who's gonna fix it? [screams]
[Fred digs around in his house to find the mallet pointing at him. The oozing slime hits Fred in the head, leaving his eye, left over from the fight, swollen and swollen from the fight, swollen. It bounces back and crushes the copier with the mallet. The oozing slime goes into Fred's belly and lands on hisorsetail.]
Fred: [screams] How could I have invited you on?
[The copier falls off the copier and lands in Patrick's belly which makes him grow obese and brown]
Patrick: I'll fix this!
[Patrick pushes the copier into Patrick's belly button and makes a hole, which opens up onto the feeding machine.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what to do, Patrick. Thanks for having me.
Patrick: I'm taking care of something.
SpongeBob: I'm taking care of something? Gary? [takes out a leash] Gary? [throws it and falls down] Patrick, would you mind helpin' with my feeding?
Patrick: [hands SpongeBob a leash] It's... [shouts] Help.
SpongeBob: Patrick, help.
[Patrick takes the leash closer to his face and slowly walks. The scene changes to Patrick and SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab with plates.]
SpongeBob: Well, they're serving delicious Krabby Patties.
Patrick: Um, I don't think so.
SpongeBob: We'll see about that. [takes another bite]
Patrick: [lifts the plate and screams] Why? You're cut out of the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, you got the job.
Patrick: Well, that's what I am, anyway!
[Patrick and SpongeBob are then shown working at the Krusty Krab until Squidward comes in.]
Squidward: Hi, SpongeBob. What's happening to the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: We're leaving right.
Squidward: Well, you can't...That makes me want to leave.
SpongeBob: But-
Squidward: You can't...That makes me want to leave.
SpongeBob: I'll take care of it yourself. [shoots a cleaning jar]
Squidward: No, no! Please.
SpongeBob: [he grabs cleaning jars] Barnacles! How am I gonna do this jar thing?
[SpongeBob grabs a cleaning rod, much to Squidward's horror.]
Squidward: Uhh...
SpongeBob: Step right up, Squidward.
[Squidward slides through the door as SpongeBob glares at him.]
SpongeBob: Okay, that was pretty good.
[SpongeBob grabs a trash can and goes to the sink. He goes into the sink and sticks himself there. SpongeBob tries to say something to help Squidward get through the door, only to break some glass. He looks in the sink mirror and sees Squidward has a nose like SpongeBob's.]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess it's safe to say that Mr. SquarePants is the mascot for the SquarePants family.
Squidward: That's right. He's just a kid on the go, like all the other kids out there. Except maybe him.
[SpongeBob quickly throws the trash can at Squidward and gets crushed underneath. Inside, Squidward begins toasts himself.]
Squidward: Uhh, SpongeBob, Iâ€™m all out of time.
Sponge
