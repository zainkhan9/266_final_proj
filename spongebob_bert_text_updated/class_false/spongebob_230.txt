[The episode begins with Gary watching TV.]
Monica: [turns off the TV] Good night, SpongeBob. [turns it up] SpongeBob, I was wondering if Gary was having any of those...
SpongeBob: Gary, I'm having these "fun" activities?
Monica: Yeah, like our Free Gift Shop Sale?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Monica: Oh, the way he is wearing this store's underwear!
SpongeBob: Well, we're gonna have to get rid of this of our own free will.
Gary: [sighs]
[Patrick comes in with some boxes as well as a whole bunch of presents.]
Patrick: SpongeBob's present...
SpongeBob: The SpongeBob SquarePants replica of himself? How about you, Gary?
Gary: [gasps] SpongeBob! What do I need you kiddin' me? I'll make your house a shrine! [pushes SpongeBob's present box toward SpongeBob's house] I'll do all you need, and keep him warm for the rest of your life. [shuts the door]
Patrick: I'm ready, I'm ready!
SpongeBob: Thank you, thank you! [stops] Oh, dear! He's not taking his presentks in... [pulls down a shirt that Patrick has taken from his head] ...front.
Patrick: I'll take that off.
SpongeBob: I don't believe you. Help! Help! I need arms! Legs! [pulls a chair Patrick is sitting on] I need arms. [climbs through the arm band and pulls one arm out from behind] Pull me!
Patrick: I'm not arms-bu... [stops and looks in SpongeBobâ€™s eyes] Oh. [looks in SpongeBob's eyes again] Eyes?
SpongeBob: I can see those, [shakes his head, not paying attention] but they're still there. Ah, in that case, you have an order for a piece.
[The scene changes to Patrick bringing a bucket of wood and a board with a hole through one end and a saw through the other.]
Patrick: This must be the home of Mr. Krabs' favorite woodworker, Mr. Eugene Krabs. Behold! [the bucket of wood reveals to be actually a smaller wooden board called a 'Twinburner Board.']
SpongeBob: I wonder what Krabs' favorite woodworker is. [laughs]
[SpongeBob pulls up his shirt with the board on it and meows in disbelief. The scene changes to Patrick looking at the board and seeing various pieces coming and going in and out of it.]
Patrick: I've never seen such a lot of wood! [his body shortens up] Well, I don't know. Why is this happening?
SpongeBob: I know it's happening. I'm just a little confused.
Patrick: Wait, wait, little confused! It's actually [turns into light and he meows in shock]
SpongeBob: [turns into light and meows in shock] Arrgh, that's... strange.
[SpongeBob begins to leave, but Patrick is already back in his wooden board. He turns back, his eyes dancing around]
Patrick: Why do you keep doing this?!
SpongeBob: I wanted to death on sight! I'm hideous! I don't wanna be remembered as such!
[SpongeBob meows in surprise and he falls himself back in his pile. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick looking at various pieces of the board. Patrick looks at one piece and SpongeBob looks at another. However, the piece on which SpongeBob was standing had an almost human face and he looks at it in confusion. He jumps to the side of the board and sees Patrick's face in confusion. He jumps to the side as well but SpongeBob runs into the board and holds it for Patrick as he meows in confusion. He runs back into the pile as he meows in confusion again. He then meows hysterically in fear]
Patrick: That's enough, SpongeBob. You're little more than a crossword puzzle. I'll try harder next time. [SpongeBob runs off and runs with it, he seems to be growing tired from fighting and from being tired from running. He stops running] What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? [tries to run] I'm trying to tell you something, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Patrick: There's no time for much thinking, little girl. For the first time, you get cold.
SpongeBob: Get cold? What am I gonna do?
