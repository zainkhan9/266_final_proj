SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick! Your camera is rolling.
Patrick: Is it time already?
SpongeBob: [points to SpongeBob's face on the camera] Here it is! Your new friend: Patrick Star.
Patrick: Who else?
SpongeBob: I thought I was gonna ask...
Patrick: But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, now is the time to introduce yourself.
Patrick: I'm Squidward Tentacles, and I like my Squidward better! [both laugh]
Squidward: A-a-a-a-ahhhh! Nice helm! [puts the helm back on and walks out]
SpongeBob: Neat! Remind me to make my friends take better care of their shells.
Squidward: Remind me to make my friends take better care of their shells.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, you're watching my show Squidward Tentacles Live! Come on down and stay away from my windows!
[cut to Squidward's windows]
Squidward: So, what do you say?
SpongeBob: I say I say I say... [SpongeBob is now on the other side of Squidward's windowsill when Squidward hears the laugh. He sees SpongeBob gone and screams]
Patrick: Hey, Squidward, you want to see my best friend back?
[Cut to SpongeBob who now stands under the siren]
SpongeBob: I...don't...like...[Squidward screams and eyeaches out] Squidward! What in Davy Jones' locker do you think you're doing?!
Sandy: Hide your shame! Hide your shame!
SpongeBob: Well, I...I don't think I did anything #HarvPack or anything.
Sandy: [shouts] Nothing, SpongeBob! I've been trying to get back to the Krusty Krab for years!
SpongeBob: [Squidward is screaming now] I can't...I can't do it!
Sandy: Don't cry, Squidward! You're still gonna get towed. We're not gonna be here for long!
[Squidward is about to cry when SpongeBob comes in laughing evilly]
SpongeBob: You know, Sandy, I've been cheating myself out of food, drink, and wood ever since I was a little lad. [holds up a big rock] I used to eat at the Krusty Krab, now I get the same meals twice a day. [takes the rock and eats it] Hey, what are you doing?! [tastes the food] Squidward, this is a gift! Get it!
Squidward: [gasps] SpongeBob! What are you doing here?! You can't leave my restaurant, come on down!
SpongeBob: You can leave, Squidward, he's my best friend.
Squidward: You can leave everybody alone, I promise.
SpongeBob: Sure you can. [tastes the food]
Squidward: Hey, this tastes like a candy wrapper!
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, what's that smell?
Squidward: I can't taste it!
SpongeBob: Well, maybe it'll make you want to eat more.
Squidward: Why would I eat more? I spent the whole day with Gary!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah?
Squidward: And Valentine's Day.
SpongeBob: I know! [laughs] I'm gonna go see Squidward! [SpongeBob and Squidward walk into the Krusty Krab. They land on the floor of the old Krusty Krab] Well, here we go. Nice ambiance. [SpongeBob's eyes turn into a star] That's the ambiance, don't you think, Squidward?
Squidward: Uhh, the décor. Hmm, well, that's the ambiance, don't you think?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's the ambiance, don't you think?
Squidward: Well, the décor. Well, that's the ambiance, Uhh, that's the ambiance, uhh, the ambiance.
SpongeBob: The ambiance. Well, the décor. [rubs his head and smells the aroma] That's the ambiance, don't you think?
Squidward: The ambiance. Well, the décor. [squeezes inside the Krusty Krab and licks the table]
SpongeBob: Uhh, can I get something on
