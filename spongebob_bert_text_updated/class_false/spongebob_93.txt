[The scene switches to The Krusty Krab where Squidward is cleaning the windows from earlier.]
Squidward: [screaming] This is the moment I've all been waiting for! [jumps on sign and gets scrubbed] A nickelâ€™ing a machine! [gets cleaned and hired a scrub brush to clean the top of his shell] And the new plan is to pay him one penny per shift. [cuts to Krusty Krab where Squidward is reading a newspaper]
SpongeBob: [screams] The next movie!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're fired!
[SpongeBob looks busy cleaning the windows from the customers' drool, so he ignores the squeal of the customers.]
Squidward: I didn't do it!
[The scene shows that all the cleaning started while he sleeps.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, snoozing, won't you Squidward?
[SpongeBob goes to sleep, but accidentally causes the window to open too early, causing snoring in Patrick'sina.]
Patrick: Oh, my eyes!
SpongeBob: Ooh, I've never been so busy.
[Patrick goes to put a blindfold on himself, but stops immediately when he sees the squished Squidward. He walks towards Squidward, who is disgusted by his cold eyes and shuts his eyes with all his might. He grabs Squidward by the shirt and uses his teeth to scrape his eyes off his cold blue skin. He then walks away, not paying any attention to what he's doing. Cut to SpongeBob coming back to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, since you can't come to work with me? Since I can't come to the Krusty Krab with me? Hey, Squidward, since you can't come to work at all? Hey, Squidward, since you can't work here? Hey, Squidward, since you can't take out your mind? Hey, Squidward, since you can't take your mind at work?
Squidward: No, SpongeBob. Only at work.
SpongeBob: Well, then you're bummed. You've only been working here for a few minutes. Why don't you quietly join the other ones in a quiet exchange of pleasantries?
Squidward: Quiet? Am I saying it? [SpongeBob gets a surprised sound from Squidward] You're right. I'm trying to find my voice. You better think of it as your voice, Mr. Voice. [ask a tall, purple, orange, purpleish talking Squidward]
SpongeBob: [offscreen) Well, I can't let you off the hook. We're not doing anything we shouldn't do. We promise here never happen again. [offscreen] Okay, don't do it. Okay. I get it. You're not coming back 'til you're upset.
Squidward: Angry Squidward? Well, if one wishes to be heard by the people, one must reject everything unreasonable.
SpongeBob: 'Twill be my last words.
Squidward: I will not let you stand my dear life down 'cause I am angry with you, for I know one day when all my attempts will be wasted.
SpongeBob: [offscreen] That's what one day will be called.
Squidward: wasted?
SpongeBob: Now what?
Squidward: I will waste them. [walks SpongeBob to his house]Focus on your work. You can't focus on your work unless you're angry.
SpongeBob: Aw, focus on what. [dives to the sofa, then to chair]
Squidward: Let's see. My chair. That's plenty comfortable for a workaholic.
SpongeBob: Ain't that so?
Squidward: No. What I'm saying is...
SpongeBob: Say what?!
Squidward: [growls angrily and comes out of his chair]I'm angry with you, SpongeBob! [starts to cry] For I know what you're trying to do with your life! [cries loudly] I'm angry that you're trying to destroy me, that youDon't appreciate what I'm trying to do with my life, that youJust let it all slide by, then and now. [crying] It wasn't that bad?
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Squidward: I mean, not really.
SpongeBob: Why is it that you don't like me so much?
Squidward: [growls in pain] Because I'm really really angry with you!
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't like you at all!
