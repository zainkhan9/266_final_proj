Weatherman: Good morning. All right, everybody. The weatherman says there's a gale from the wind.
Patrick: Gale.
Geologist: Wow. That's wind that blows so freely across this area. Wha-what's that?
Patrick: That's a gust of wind blowing through this part of the island.
Geologist: Oh, yeah. This part of Bikini Bottom is the perfect place for a gale because it's so dern-shaped. [As the geologist thought, a piece of the island falls on top of him]
Patrick: Gah! [gasps] Oh!
Geologist: Wow. A gust of wind blowing through here just blew enough strength to shake the whole surface of Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: What's that?
Geologist: It's what's known as a 'sea-level rise'. [Geologist imagines a scene and it shows Bikini Bottom. The scene changes to show Sandy's treedome. The scene changes to show the island with the greatest amount of rain since the end of time. The island is shown.] Hai! [She hears a crash from outside. Patrick touches it and it falls on top of Sandy. Patrick hears a squelching sound from inside her] Wha-wha-why!?
Sandy: We lost a sister!
Patrick: Hmm... [The scene changes to show the Bikini Bottom with its crown on. SpongeBob is shown holding a picnic table.] Ahh! The greatest day of the year!
SpongeBob: I'll take the crown, Patrick. [She hands him something and he takes it]
Patrick: Hey!
SpongeBob: But... [He looks at the stand that is broken and screams of the customers]
Harold: My leg! My leg! [An old man comes out]
Medley: Down, down, down!
Mr. Krabs: [He comes out] Me money! [He takes the old man's money and laughs. The scene changes to show the interior of the Krusty Krab. Sandy is shown at a table. She is wearing a hat with a basket and holding a plate. Bashir is shown at a table. He is stepping on some sand. He gets hit in the face with some sand. He runs over to a stand that has two sand points. Monroe holds a ball and SpongeBob hits it a bunch. Sandy kicks the sand ball to Monroe] Thank you, nemaline june. [Sandy gets hit in the face with the sand ball. The scene changes to show the exterior of the Krusty Krab. O'Neil gets hit in the face with the sand ball and gets transformed into a jellyfish. He floats around SpongeBob and Squidward]
O'Neil: Hey, SpongeBob, want to go first? [SpongeBob picks up the jellyfish and burps it in his nose]
SpongeBob: Neat. [SpongeBob floats away. The scene changes to show the exterior of the Krusty Krab. Karen comes out.] Ah, captain. [The scene returns to captain. [A group of robots are shown. They are in a cargo ship with the cargo quarters up front.] We've cleared out Plankton's terror on the island.
Karen: Sorry, sir, you've got a bit of a [The scene returns to captain. Plankton is shown on the ship's cargo ring. He is wearing a visor and holding a balloon. He looks at it. It smells like perfume. Plankton starts to cry and leaves the ship. The scene returns to captain. Plankton is next to the group that showed up earlier.] We wiped Plankton out.
Plankton: [While They Cleaped] I was the one that split the Krabs. [They Cleaped] And I said, "Us." [They Cleaped] We're all one big happy family.

He then gets down on his knees and starts crying] Oh, Patrick. Oh, the Krusty Krab is much better off without you. [Patrick gets up] Oh, yeah. Well, thank you, thank you, thank you. [He runs off. The scene returns to Plankton, Karen, the Chum Bucket, and the ship. Plankton, who is licking the peanut butter, shakes of the three. He
