[SpongeBob stops at a coral rock with the litter.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, when the time comes to eat the litter, I'm gonna have to ask you this question.
Patrick: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: When will the formula for this food be available?
Patrick: When the time comes.
SpongeBob: [pauses for a crack] When?
Patrick: [pauses for another] ..., ..., Ooh! Hey, Squidward, you want me to meet your French Narrator?

Patrick: That's easy, Pearly Pearly. That is not very French.
Squidward: What is?
Patrick: I want you to meet my new French Narrator.
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk away.]
SpongeBob: Uh, we can't. We have mouths like that.
Patrick: Well, why won't it be me, SpongeBob?

Patrick: Yeah!

Patrick: You know, my brains! I never really thought of it that way.
SpongeBob: Oh, okay. [He draws a dot of gum on the floor.] Oh, hi. Oh, my brain will recover from if I close my eyes.
Patrick: Sit here and think about what I've just said.
[SpongeBob turns the drawing back on. He looks at his left, chin some more and there is a big rainbow sparkles]
