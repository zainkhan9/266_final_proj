[At the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office, humming the overdue order. He notices something on the table.]
Mr. Krabs: This'll be great. This'll be so much fun.
SpongeBob: [looks over to Sandy] Do you mind, Mr. Krabs? We're trying to get the Krusty Krab to hand over all the loot to the rightful owner, not the other way around.
Mr. Krabs: The rightful owner? That's a loaded word, SpongeBob, right there?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You're gonna have to go that way, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Not until you give up the loot! How can that be the rightful owner of my business?
Mr. Krabs: You were saying? [laughs] No, I'm not.
SpongeBob: Give up the loot and I'll hand over the Krabby Patty to the rightful owner.
Mr. Krabs: In that case... [laughs]
SpongeBob: Then let's go!
SpongeBob: Oh, no time, Mr. Krabs.
Sandy: Hop onto that, SpongeBob! I'm gonna have to teach her how to make a Krabby Patty herself.
SpongeBob: [laughs] I'm getting off on this one.
Sandy: Hop onto that, SpongeBob! I'm gonna have to teach her how to make a Krabby Patty herself. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [gulps] Tartar sauce. [pushes the desk to SpongeBob] I'm gonna be teaching her how to make a Krabby Patty herself. [pushes the desk back to SpongeBob]
[SpongeBob makes a Patty with the crust and mayo, radishes, ketchup, on the side, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, and mayo in olive. Sandy is going to order the secret ingredients and Mr. Krabs will be testing them out. SpongeBob is going to drive, Sandy will drive, Mr. Krabs will be chopping and turning, and SpongeBob will get burned from the heat. Eventually, Mr. Krabs decides to give the order a try.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, this is it. [chops his car] Delicious.
[The car drives away.]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't go against that order, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, good luck with that, boy. Maybe next time. [holds a pencil and pencil and cancels it] Maybe 'Plasmas' will iron out.
[SpongeBob writes "Plasmas" on the pencil and cancels it.]
SpongeBob: Next!"
Mr. Krabs: [reads the pencil] "Next?" I hate order number. [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs orders the customers to move.]
Sandals: Hurry up, kid. They're moved!
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs moving the "Plasmas" sign to the "Quitters"â€”the house of cards and a card that has Plasmas in it become the house of cards and a card became the house of cards and a card became the house of cards and a card.]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, that's it. All my customers, my customers! What do you think?
Fred: Hey, pal, what's the secret?
Plasmas: Hey, Plasmas, do you want me to leave you alone?
Fred: No, meet the Krabby Patties! The Krabby Patties!
Plasmas: Guy, you ruined my free Krabby Patty!
Squidward: [runs to the door] What's that, e-mail?
Mr. Krabs: It goeth straight through your e-mail?
[Plasmas coughs as he does so.]
Plasmas: Guys, you made me a lousy Krabby Patty and now you're going to throw me away!
[Plasmas blows his nose. Mr. Krabs gasps.]
Mr. Krabs: This is the second time I've tell you that I hate money.
Plasmas: What?! No!
Mr. Krabs: This is the most ridiculous, uncle! I hope you're not throwing away my paycheck.
Plasmas: uncle?
Mr. Krabs: This is ridiculous uncle, and you are throwing away my paycheck?!
Plasmas: [uncomfortable] What do you mean?!
Mr. Krabs: [angry] You can't throw away my paycheck!
Plasmas: Uncle Krabs?!
Mr. Krabs: It
