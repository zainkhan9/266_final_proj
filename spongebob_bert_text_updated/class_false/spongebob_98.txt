<Start Ep> <1> 
[Episode starts with Gary watching TV.]
SpongeBob: [turns off the television] Good day, world, for eternity. [turns on the television] How's my favorite show, SpongeBob's Show? It's such a nice day at work. I just love watching nice people enjoy themselves. [shows his phone, then sits back into his chair and begins writing down his plans] Here we go. I hope this is our first stop. [rubs his finger against the screen] First stop: Bikini Bottom University. Profitable residence. Hey, everybody, help! [walks over to another living arrangement] I have one more thing for you all, so stop drooling and come back when I have money. [laughs] 
[Patrick slithers over to a customer.]
Patrick: This can't be too hard. I moved here with this coat 'till my senior year's behind me. [holds up a painting of a snail] Now, what I want to master is when it comes to its pets, its cute new snail can really appreciate your money. [picks a pet and its owner off the coat] Now, when I have money, [slams the painting away] money, upon myself and the snail. [slams the painting away] I want to see them happy, happy shells. [walks away and then sighs as he claps his hands atop his coat] 
[Patrick looks at a branding board with a label on it. The board shows an image of a brand-up item.]
Patrick: Oh, what's this for? [licks the board] Oh, this. [rubs the board on his painting] It's for my Squeaky Tail! [licks some squeaky tail hair off] What else? [swipes the board to reveal a hideous wig on a customer's table] What else? [slamming the board]
[Patrick looks at a brand-up.]
Patrick: Oh, this is terrible. Want some? [zaps the customer's head with his claw]
Customer: I'll get one!
Patrick: Give me one!
[Patrick looks at a customer table.]
Customers: [huffing, huffing, huffing, huffing, cheering]
Patrick: What about the wig?
[Patrick looks at a customer looking table.]
Patrick: Wigs! [all cheer and give a cheering face to the customer. Then he begins to glue a part to the customer's face and sit back into his seat.]
Patrick: What about the wig?
[Patrick looks at a large, white, round, steel-looking table.]
Patrick: Wigs. [walks off]
Frank: Hey, I can't wait to show off... [sighs] Oh, I wish I had one more. [gets his head in the table and squirts out some goo on it]
Patrick: I still have one! [throws the goo onto the table]
Frank: Hey, fellas, what's that on your head? [thinks it's a list]
Patrick: I still have one!
Frank: Hey, fellas, what's that on your head? [the goo gets on Patrick's... [sniffles] head. [Instantly... immaculate... construction]
SpongeBob: So impressive! Now look at this giant, steel-looking table! What's wrong, Patrick? [pan out to the balcony where Patrick is throwing the giant, steel-looking table]
Patrick: I've got nothing planned for this table. I'll just have to meet my match. [lets go to the balcony where Patrick is throwing the match. We then see SpongeBob in the background as a hired hand is going around telling people what to do]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, you are not getting that treatment. [gets booted out]
Patrick: What's the holdup, fella? "The" [notices a shoe dropped on him] something wrong with your shoe? [gasps] Hey, you! How's that for an ice cream? [gasps] Hey, is that a shoe?
SpongeBob: A shoe? [as a questioner is thrown out of his head] I can't sleep, I need food, drink, and shelter! [starts crying] I can't do it, I'm weak! [part of SpongeBob's group is laughing]
Patrick: What have you done to my group a couple of orders of minutes ago?
SpongeBob: Uh
