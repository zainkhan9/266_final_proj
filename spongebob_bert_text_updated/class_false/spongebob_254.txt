[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick at the counter with SpongeBob saying "cheese" and "sausage"]
SpongeBob: What is this, Patrick?
Patrick: That's the song of the jib. Spaghetti. I don't like spaghetti. I'll only make cheese from scratch.
SpongeBob: Hey, I don't like cheese, but that's another story.
Patrick: SpongeBob, I'm home early. I'm working late. How are you gonna stay?
SpongeBob: [laughs] I don't know. Just go on home. [goes into his house and sits on the chair] I really need to know.
Patrick: This is silly. I'm going to the concert. I have to know. [goes back to his chair]
SpongeBob: You'll have to ask him. [Patrick bursts into tears] Did you hear what I just heard?
Patrick: [still crying] I'll have you know, he's no sax, I have to know. [cries more. Scene cuts to the counter where SpongeBob is finishing up his studies. SpongeBob peaks through the window and sees Patrick singing a song]
SpongeBob: Let's do this! Let's do this! [Patrick starts to stop playing after one arm pulls him back up. SpongeBob continues to sob] At last you can say victory has been mine. [everyone cheers] Thank you.
Squidward: You have to say it. [song ends]
Patrick: Let's get this party started.
SpongeBob: Yeah. [scoops the soda machine and takes out a can]
SpongeBob: Thanks again, buddy.
Patrick: You know, I don't feel like it.
SpongeBob: Ooh. You sure do.
Patrick: Yeah. I sure do.
SpongeBob: Yeah, you know, I don't think this is the kind of music we're gonna get tonight.
Patrick: Let's get outta here.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Let's get that party started.
Patrick: Okay.

Mrs. Puff: You bet. Now get out of here before they hit you with a new, ridiculous... [SpongeBob gets excited again and smashes into the window with the same hammer. The window breaks off as everyone else start to cry]

Mrs. Puff: Yes. The only Sunday on the whole Neptune's Moon is right here.
Officer: Wow. You're a cop, then why did you do it?
