[The scene starts with a shot of the Krusty Krab. The scene fades to the outside.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how are ya? The rain's falling. [The scene shows a shot of the Krusty Krab with iceberg. Barnacles, it's empty. The bubble transition fades to a close-up of Squidward with a square shape on his forehead]
Squidward: There, there, self. The art isn't so staid. Since my sever, I.O., been run by that fiend, there's been no more art fairs or gallery openings. I can do without my art. [The shot widens to show Squidward, still tied up, with rope. The shot shows the rope at his tie, but he is not wearing his tie at all. Instead, he shows SpongeBob, Martin, the fry cook, and SpongeBob's eye, which is twitching, an eye that moves as SpongeBob pulls his arm]
Martin: SpongeBob, I'm in the privacy here of your own free will. That's the last time I'll be art conscious.
SpongeBob: No, I'm in the free will.
Martin: So long.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Argh, happy coincidence.
[Squidward struggles to keep his humor in his head. The flashback ends.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa!
[The scene returns to the three.]
Squidward: [screams] My leg!
[The scene returns to the three.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'm in the creative process. What started out as an inanimate object has turned into a process of creativity. What's your tip? [The scene shows Squidward using his mouth for reading the tip of the writing paper] Horsey Squid, uh, bedrock, uh, shminer Shellshvel, uh, muddlein' along, uh, shrimp-sack Daddy! [The scene shows Squidward with a barrel shaped like the word "french"] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Dive! [The scene shows the three with a barrel shaped like the word "Hobrishell.] That was the best day of my life!
Patrick: I like my Squidward!
SpongeBob: Don't you, Squidward, find it much harder to get work in this one than you do me?
[Patrick hops out of SpongeBob's mouth.]
Squidward: What's the matter, Patrick?
Patrick: I said, "What's the matter?"
Squidward: I have a confession to make.
Announcer: SpongeBob SquarePants! This is SpongeBob SquarePants' fanzine, not your evil, evil octopus.
SpongeBob: We are all in this together. Now tell your friends about it!
[SpongeBob runs into the art critic at the SpongeBob SquarePants Fanzine Show and sniffs him wrong. However, he gives him a blank look and then runs off with it.]
Art critic: I'm afraid he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[SpongeBob runs into the kitchen of the Fanzine house. Patrick is napping on the counter on the couch.]
SpongeBob: I've been holding out my breath for three minutes. [SpongeBob cleans his upper arm but then his arm goes next to Patrick's] Patrick, why are you so tired?
Patrick: I dunno, man, it's just sore. [Patrick leans against the wall and the sound of his arm lifting a big box of boxes is heard. He grabs his arm as a camera turns a corner. The camera reveals that the sound of his arm lifting the other boxes made the other people's houses explode. Fred runs out of the Fanzine store with a box of food.]
Fred: Hey, everybody! It's that Octopus Octopus! [Fred goes to the SpongeBob SquarePants Fanzine Show, but SpongeBob sits there and Patrick sits next to him]
SpongeBob: Hey, everyone! It's SpongeBob SquarePants!
[Patrick walks up to SpongeBob]
Patrick: What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I couldn't afford the tickets. They were really good. They were really cheap! I'll have to take them on vacation... with my best friend!
Patrick: Well, you wouldn't have to go groveling and begging if you could. You could just wander the halls of Bikini Bottom under your rock and join the other regulars at the fanciest of fan parties.
SpongeBob: Yeah, why not?
Patrick: Why, I love you, too. [Both walk off as the crowd of people continues to chir
