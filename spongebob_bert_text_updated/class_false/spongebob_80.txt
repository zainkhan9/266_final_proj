[episode begins with a view of Bikini Bottom. Larry is in his condiment store picking what he can and puts in his jars. He rows at an anchovy, he rows at an anchovy and he puts in his chili, then he puts in his soup, then he puts in his tomatoes, then he puts in his tomatoes, then he puts in his kelp fries, then he puts in his seaweed salad, then he puts in his soup, then he puts in his kelp karate, then he puts in his kelp ketchup, then he puts in his seaweed crisp, then he puts in his seaweed manicure, then he puts in his seaweed manicure, he puts in his kelp karate, then he puts in his seaweed toothpaste, then he puts in his seaweed toothpaste, kelp karate, then he puts in his seaweed toothpaste, then he puts in his seaweed toothpaste, then he puts in your kelp karate, then you'll get seaweed toothpaste.
Larry: That's better.
[he walks away.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, can I get my kelp karate now?
Mr. Krabs: Not now, Mr. Squidward. You'll be doing the same people again.
[he walks away.]
Patrick: How's it looking, Mr. Squidward?
[he walks away. He pulls out a large green bottle cap and reads the label.]
Patrick: It's the kelp karate you!
Mr. Krabs: [reads from the label] "U.S.A.R.B.T.K.C". Ooh! Is that true?
Patrick: It sure is, my dear Mr. Krabs. They're my certified biker friends. See?
[he holds a clipboard and holds it up to Patrick]
Mr. Krabs: "U.S.A.R.B.T.K.C." Alright, this is all verified. No new charges or anything but my sworn duty of carefree observation.
[he takes the clipboard from Patrick]
Mr. Krabs: Aw, well, well, well, it's all just a little bit ridiculous.
[he walks back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick, if you want any free samples of kelp kah [the color light behind him turns into a green juice] just sign this petition.
Patrick: Well, I don't know. [takes out the petition and signs it]
SpongeBob: Great! That's a great way to put it...to say...no.
Patrick: Well then, why did you sign it?
SpongeBob: I don't know.
Patrick: Well, I don't want to sign anything.
SpongeBob: Why not?
Patrick: Well, could you sign this petition?
SpongeBob: Well, how about you sign it? [shakes his head] Okay...this isn't working.
[he takes a chair and puts it over SpongeBob's head]
Patrick: What's going on?
SpongeBob: Uh, anything but your, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, I don't...
SpongeBob: No!
Patrick: No! No!
SpongeBob: [breaks the chair, shattering it in half] Wup-doo! Wup-doo! Wup-doo!
Mr. Krabs: And if you'd like to...
Patrick: No! [SpongeBob tears up some more and looks calm and collected]
Mr. Krabs: All right, look. We've got an important announcement to make.
SpongeBob: Title!
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy!
SpongeBob: I can't wait to see the look on your face! [appears to have my face and Mr. Krabs' eyes]
Mr. Krabs: Hello!
[he walks off]
SpongeBob: Title, how do we spell it?
Mr. Krabs: It's, "The Krusty Krab is haunted by Mr. Krabs."
SpongeBob: [reads the sign] The Krusty Krab is haunted by Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Horror!
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, that's the name, Krabs and the curse.
Mr. Krabs: Horror!
SpongeBob: [reads the cursed word] S-R-A-N-G-I-R-O.
Mr. Krabs: S-R-A-N-G-I-R-O?
SpongeBob: I mean, I know Krabs is haunted, but just how are we going to
