Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidward. How 'bout some fun, huh, Harold?
Squidward: You mean we could go to work now.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, we can stay up pretty late today, lad.
Harold: Sure thing, boy. [Squidward turns off the flickering light of the Krusty Krab] I can't wait to see your patty. [closes the double doors and goes to the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Looks like we're gonna need some help. [the customers are clamoring for our patty] What do you got?
Harold: How much is it, boy?
Customer: One can only buy our patty through this web.
SpongeBob: And how do you wanna spend them $100?
Harold: Spend 'em all myself. [takes out a straw]
SpongeBob: No, I'm talking about buying one for $250 and adding $250 to the equation.
Harold: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: I just want a Krabby Patty with extra Krabby Sauce. [suddenly, the sound of a door opening]
Mr. Krabs: What in blazes would you do with a Krabby Patty?
Squidward: That's what we'll be doing, SpongeBob. We're going to call Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [Spoken] Krabs?
Squidward: Yes, Mr Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Whatâ€™s the matter, boy? Has it been a while lately?
Squidward: Yes. I have a bowl full of Krabby Patties and they all say I leave them on the table since day 15.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you get a break this week, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Two years later, job well done. [runs off screen]
Mr. Krabs: That's the spirit this week, boy. [cuts to the Krusty Krab]Working man, this place is heavy with danger. I'd better give them a break. But remember, the love you've shown me, I cannot ignore.You must not lose sight of your mission. [Opens a new window. Sits down there] It's very simple. I willedly lead the Krabby Patties myself, [Closes the window] until they are full. [Goes to the kitchen] When they are, [Takes out a sledgehammer] smash them to pieces. [Gets back up] Wipe them clean. [Takes out the sledge. Opens up another window] And lastly, it's time for... [Takes out a sledgehammer. Opens up another window] ...wall-hackers. [Takes out a sledgehammer. Opens up another window] ...everyone's waiting for you.
Fish #1: I wanna see this for what it is,
fish #2: You wanna see my hard-earned hard- earned?
Mr. Krabs: Eh, what?
Fish #1: You don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. Krabs: I don't know what you're talking about, [Looks at SpongeBob] or [Looks at SpongeBob for what he is saying.] or [Looks at SpongeBob for how he wants to make a copy of it.] or [Looks at SpongeBob for how to read it.] or [Looks at SpongeBob for the last one.

[SpongeBob has a nose at the front of the Krusty Krab. The two start to walk off]
SpongeBob: What's the meaning of this, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: It's my last one. I'm gonna go fatter then you. [He starts to look like a bull] Why don't you give me a raise?
SpongeBob: [very angry] Why don't you raise me?
Mr. Krabs: That's what you say. [very angry] That's what you say! [Very Close to SpongeBob a brick is hitting his head] 
SpongeBob: That's not gonna make him... [Smacks the brick and knocks over a picture of Squidward] hurt anymore.
