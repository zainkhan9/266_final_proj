[The scene changes to SpongeBob washing his windows while birds are chirping in the background.]
SpongeBob: Ow! [grunts as he cleans his windows] What could be better?! [whimpers as he cleans his broken windows]
[SpongeBob goes to the window and screams in pain.]
Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob, broken windows are just as annoying as the annoying guy.
[SpongeBob gets himself broken windows into many pieces and puts them all back together in his house. He also renovated his sink with his own sweat.]
SpongeBob: I'm glad we got this deal, Patrick.
Patrick: Thank you, SpongeBob! [sits on his clarinet] You finally gave me what I was born to... to clean!
SpongeBob: I think, for me, this deal pays off.
[SpongeBob attempts to blow out the candles with his clarinet. He ends up doing the same thing twice. After doing both, Patrick strains and blows out the candles. He then blows out the candles again.]
Patrick: Oh, thank you, SpongeBob! [pushes some flowers on Patrick's lap] I thought you guys were some kind of friends.
SpongeBob: Actually, I's pretty good at that. [spits it out]
[SpongeBob clears the candles and blows out the sun. The air becomes so full of condensation that SpongeBob's shirt is covered in condensation, which causes his eyes, nose, and ears to water up.]
SpongeBob: Ew. Patrick seems to be losing all hope for hope.
[SpongeBob blows out the candles, puts himself in a giant hole, and comes out with a grand piano that is completely covered in fire. He starts playing and singing.]
Patrick: [hums and singing] ♪La...La... La...♪ [broke] I can't stop crying tonight, I can't stop... I can't stop... from... from... from... my bed! La, la, la, la...♪
[SpongeBob breaks through the window and runs out. But Patrick, with a knife in his pants and a whistle in his ears, blocks the door. SpongeBob floats up and down in a wave like a raisin.]
Patrick: Ha, ha, all that waiting was making me thirsty.
[SpongeBob stops in his tracks and his clothes start to dry out. SpongeBob's clock goes backwards. Then it goes right after him. Gary meows and Patrick starts eating his shellfish.]
Patrick: Oh, hey, SpongeBob... [points to himself pocketing the Krabby Patty] that's your pocket change!
SpongeBob: [walks to the window] I just don't get it. Why do I have to wait in that spot when I can get my hands on these... [opens up the... um... cash register? window? window?! ] Wait, that's the sign. Oh, well, at least I don't have to spend anymore of my money! [runs to the register] All right, Patrick, you have it all... [gets stung by a clam] You have it by me, have it no? Worse, Pecos Patrick? [screams]
Patrick: [gets whacked in the head by a giant clam] What kind of fool runs a family business?
SpongeBob: [looks at the clock and gasps] Oh, it's time for "Sit and Think"! [takes out his calculator and pencil and paper] What do we do now? Do I go to bed now? Patrick, do I go to bed now? [Patrick takes his pencil and paper and writes down the date on it] We have to think.
Patrick: No. [throws his pencil out and tries to write something down on the planner] I think we should think.
SpongeBob: No. No, no, Patrick. That's my idea.
[Scene cuts to the three of them standing in front of the SpongeBob SquarePants house.]
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants is it?
SpongeBob: No, it's not it, Patrick.
Patrick: It's beautiful.
SpongeBob: It is, Patrick, it's true.
Patrick: It's true?
SpongeBob: No, it's not, it's not, it's not.
Patrick: It's true.
SpongeBob: It's true!
Patrick: It's true!
SpongeBob: No! [throws his pencil at the sky] It's not there!
Patrick: It's not there either.
SpongeBob: It's gone! [screams and runs away] So I must act quickly, my little errand.
