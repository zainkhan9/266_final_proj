[The episodes starts with SpongeBob reading The Guinness Star. He then gets transported to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is having a conversation with his employees]
Mr. Krabs: You know, boy-o, I love my new digs. [scene cuts to SpongeBob at the register, talking with his heart, muscles, and teeth] When do I start? [SpongeBob stares sternly] When do I start? [SpongeBob starts to get hired] When do I think I'm gonna get here? [SpongeBob leans towards the doors, but they stick] When do I start? [SpongeBob leans more towards the kitchen, but the oil change sticks to his face. He whispers] When do I start? [SpongeBob leans more towards the kitchen, but the pan gets stuck to his face] When do I start? [SpongeBob leans more towards the back, but the gas is stuck to his face] How do ya turn it!? [SpongeBob starts to walk towards the grill, but it's too high] Huh? [SpongeBob starts to walk more towards the kitchen, but it's too high] Hh? [SpongeBob gets the oil pump stuck to his face, so he leans towards the grill. The pan gets fed through the hole in the kitchen window, and gets torn along the sides. He whispers] How do ya turn it!? [SpongeBob starts to walk towards the grill, but it's too high] Huh? [SpongeBob starts to walk towards the kitchen, but it's too high] Hh? [SpongeBob is getting close to the fumes] Huh? [SpongeBob gets close to the fumes] Huh?
Martha: SpongeBob! [knocks the doors open] Hey, SpongeBob! [shows Mrs. Puff] You need a minute to make your seat for me. [SpongeBob makes his chair] I brought all the supplies: a blender, a metal detector, a metal detector stick, a coffee maker, a mustard maker, an abrasive headgear, a cinderblock, a hammer, and, of course, a pair of smelly boots. SpongeBob, would you excuse me for a second? [SpongeBob makes his 'Sir Urchin's' shoes? Sir Urchin's were so stink good, he had to be caged in his boot. SpongeBob stares at Martha]
SpongeBob: Here you go, Martha. [Mrs. Puff leaves, and SpongeBob does the same for her husband]
Mrs. Puff: Thanks for a great business, SpongeBob! Now what are you going to do with me?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm going to turn it into a nice, upscale Italian restaurant! [hands the phone off the ringing phone]
Mrs. Puff: Hello? Uhh, I'm trying to find a place for me in town residence. Can you please give me the address?
SpongeBob: That's easy, Mrs. Puff. just follow the rules. [rules clearly state that I must stay above 6 feet of ground, but I disagree with this and the fish inside are going to beat me up]
Mrs. Puff: Rules? SpongeBob, you're going to have to be a stick in the eye!
SpongeBob: Stick in the eye? Well, I disagree. I like to stick out my eye!
Mrs. Puff: Then I'll let you decide for yourself. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Whatever, Puff... Hey! [Mrs. Puff screams and runs away, while SpongeBob follows inside] SpongeBob! [checks his watch] Huh? Hmm? Oh! Must be doing trouble.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, SpongeBob, I'm not the only one...
SpongeBob: Look, it's the hottest hot-blooded mammal in the entire ocean. [Mrs. Puff screams] I hope you like your day off, Puff girl.
Mrs. Puff: It's been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good day, Bob!
SpongeBob: Oh, day off? I can't man the heat.
Mrs. Puff: It's the hottest day ever.
SpongeBob: Yeah, all the water in the whole world's greatest city is ... beat 'em up.
Mrs. Puff: Beat 'em up? That's not even...
SpongeBob: [jumps inside the tub] Excuse me, lady.
Mrs. Puff: I think you'll find that amusing.
SpongeBob: Excuse me, lady?
Mrs. Puff: What are you doing standing on me?
SpongeBob: I thought you'd never ask. [chuckles] I just thought you great-great-
