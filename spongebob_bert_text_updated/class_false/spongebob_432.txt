SpongeBob: [to his buddy Buddy] Hi, SpongeBob.
Buddy: Hey buddy. How's my turn?
SpongeBob: Good morning, B.M.C.H. Hey, buddy, whatcha doing?
Buddy: Uh, I can't remember. I just got back from my vacation in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: I've got something for ya to do! What are you doing here, buddy?
Buddy: vacation?
SpongeBob: I've got some important stuff to do!
Buddy: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Uhh, whatcha doing?
Buddy: I've got some friends here that I can't wait to see.
SpongeBob: Uhh, what do they have?
Buddy: Here they are... [gets hit with a lawnmower and gets bashed in the head by a lawnmower man] ...with my very own lawn mower.
William Krabs: What?
[SpongeBob and Buddy grab Jellyfish and Playmates.]
SpongeBob: Jellyfish?
Buddy: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Oh, wait! I know this means you're here to ondurate me, but will you dmurgeon me to death with your gross, disgusting, degenerate, hoooood?! I would give any fool the same carefree years of my life, and I guarantee they'd heap the full attention span on me if I got back to throwing things.
William Krabs: Gentlemation.
SpongeBob: How could you, William? Your friend could talk!
Buddy: Well, maybe we could just get you to take a nap on the beach.
William Krabs: Let's get you to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Depart instead!
[SpongeBob goes to the Krusty Krab on the side of the road, and goes inside, grilling and eating the Krabby Patties. He sighs in relief.]
Buddy: Hey, SpongeBob. You promised we'd go to the Krusty Krab when the sun came.
SpongeBob: I didn't.
Buddy: Hey, when the bees come, guys? [he walks off.]
SpongeBob: I guess things will be all right in your life, now that I'm out of here. [he pulls out a telescope and points it at SpongeBob] It was a nice day for a nice day at the Krusty Krab. [SpongeBob imagines a bee hive at his door] Here's your millionth burger. [he opens the door, and a young woman comes out.]
SpongeBob: What's that?
Woman: A crab burger.
SpongeBob: Why, thank you, honey. [he hands her a dollar, and the woman growls] I must know your fate. [SpongeBob picks up the crab burger, puts it in his pocket, and leaves]
Buddy: I'm afraid my friend has enough of this heap of nonsense. [SpongeBob leaves, and the scene changes to SpongeBob going through the Krusty Krab many times, looking for the exit sign. The scene changes to SpongeBob looking through a magnifying glass. He looks inside the restaurant. The scene changes to show the interior. There is a sign that reads, "Buried Treasure Island". SpongeBob walks down the island. The scene changes to show the submarine. SpongeBob is walking on the island. The scene changes to show the submarine with its lights off. SpongeBob is walking by himself underwater.]
SpongeBob: [Off-Screen] Hang on, you don't!
[SpongeBob opens the submarine door, and there is a knock on it. SpongeBob opens his eyes, and there is a knock on him again. He opens his eyes again, and there is a knock on him again. He opens his eyes again, and there is a knock on him again. He opens his eyes again, and there is a knock on him again.]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh!
[The scene shows that the door to the island opens all over SpongeBob, while inside, is carrying a dead end.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob shakes his head, disappointed. The scene shows another blow-out, which causes the island to look like it is going backwards. Mr. Krabs comes out of the submarine, still carrying the dead end.]
Mr. Krabs: It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's!
[The scene shows a side-by-side, split-screen shot of the inside of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs and Sponge
