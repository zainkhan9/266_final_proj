[The episode starts when a customer comes in and picks up a Soda. He walks up to the counter and buys some Soda from Mr. Krabs. Then he walks up to the counter and buys some Soda from Mrs. Puff]
Mr. Krabs: I wonder what Karen's doing at the Chum Bucket. [Mr. Krabs gets so angry, he screams at the Chum Bucket. He knocks down the register, trying to calm down the customers]
Nat: Karen's not here, man!
Karen: That's not what I mean, dear.
Nat: I heard that.
Mr. Krabs: What is that kind of thing?
Karen: It's what Karen did with those hermit crabsone earlier today, man! Theyll kill us! [Customers gasp]
Nat: That's for tomorrow, man!
Mr. Krabs: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! [faints]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: It sure is, boy! You keep me down!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: [shaking sadly] Oh, I'm gonna be okay, boy.
SpongeBob: Just don't miss it. It may be new ground, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What, what, what?
SpongeBob: New customers. New customers this week, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs salutes the crowd] Bawaa, bawaa! I mean, the Chum Bucket. [Mr. Krabs throws a bucket of chum meat to the crowd] You tossed this place right into the Chum Bucket!
Mr. Krabs: That's not true!
SpongeBob: And you toss it right in the middle of me!? And I haven't even been here one minute! [SpongeBob makes a face] Whaa...?
Mr. Krabs: What about me?!
SpongeBob: You don't have to be a... [Mr. Krabs makes a disgusted expression. SpongeBob grins]
Mr. Krabs: What a filthy... [SpongeBob makes a more sophisticated one. He makes another one] ...cuckoo clock. [SpongeBob makes a similar one. Mr. Krabs makes a similar one as well] Now, I've seen this before. [Mr. Krabs makes a disgusted expression, SpongeBob makes a different one] Now, I've only ever seen this before. [SpongeBob makes a similar one. Mr. Krabs makes a more elaborate one] Now, I've only ever seen this before. [SpongeBob makes a similar one, both times]
Mr. Krabs: What is this?! [The crowd gasps, they see SpongeBob's disgusted expression, they run out of gas, and they're screaming]
SpongeBob: [to Mr. Krabs] I need to call in some help. [to Mr. Krabs] Please help me! They've told me to get to the front of the line, and I'm going to get it.
[cut to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs on a muddy hill.]
Mr. Krabs: What is it about you that makes people go?
SpongeBob: We're so darned, we're so darned!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs dig into their pockets. When they find nothing under their feet, they run out and grab the stuff. Then they run to the litter box, close the door, close the lid, and close the lid over the box. They do this while Mr. Krabs is on top of the box, absorbing the juices. They lie down on the floor, while Mr. Krabs is licking the poop. Then they go back to licking the litter box. When they do, it's during the lunch hour.]
Mr. Krabs: Lunch hour?
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs giggle. The scene changes to nighttime. Mr. Krabs is asleep and the rooster crows. The crowd is still following him, even though the entire place is empty.]
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know. One could say that close to the action. [Mr. Krabs is still sleeping as the crowd continues to move] That was close enough. Now there's a line.
[Mr. Krabs walks up to SpongeBob and picks him up.]
Mr. Krabs: I like you, boy. [Mr. Krabs gets up and walks to SpongeBob.] Well, it's the old time. You're not wearing your hat over.
SpongeBob: [slides off his hat] No, I'm not. [
