[Scene starts outside of the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is chopping up dough.]
Mr. Krabs: You'll never get those patties past my art collection, Bashes!
Squidward: [gets hit by a spatula and screams] Oh, yeah! Look at that, hmmm... I'm pulling teeth! [Screams as he slides downPinch-o-matic, morphs into his birdlike figure; then sits down, touches the floor, and takes a sample] I gave you the blueprint...
Mr. Krabs: Ah, forget it. [takes a patty and turns it into bread]
Squidward: [screams] Where's the buns? [walks outside and gets mauled by a mini mini Mr. Krabs] Come back here! [Mr. Krabs gets mauled by mini Mr. Krabs; he looks down] My treasures!
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob entering the Krusty Krab again with a Krabby Patty and hears a knock at the door.]
Squidward: What's this? An employee can't enter the Krusty Krab? [enters the Krusty Krab] Ah! Here's a Krabby Patty! [A cashier comes in] Ah, is that so?
Cashier: What is?
Squidward: The Krabby Patty you gave me is gone!
Cashier: Oh, well, what is?
Squidward: The smell of rotten patties makes me think I'm food short. [gasps] My friends are gonna eat at this place!
[Scene cuts to the mini Mr. Krabs being held up like a balloon; he falls down then swings up and down and stuffs the balloon holding Mr. Krabs up like a balloon and readsjusting his belt; he then takes off his pants and dips his tongue out then imitates Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [imitating Mr. Krabs] SpongeBob, will you get off of me?!
SpongeBob: Permission to leave, Mr. Krabs. [imitates Mr. Krabs] Thank you. [pats down the floor] See you tomorrow. [throws him off as he hits the floor]
[The mini Mr. Krabs floats around talkative and jazzed up state.]
Squidward: Not so fast, SpongeBob! How many times do I have to tell you?! Leave me, please! I can't handle this!
[SpongeBob follows in the Mr. Krabs' footsteps and takes a bite out of the mini Krabby Patty. He takes out his clarinet then he starts singing in the stifled stifled of an ambulance-fed bed-catcher.]
Paco: Ooh, pot, pot, pot, pot! [Opens a door for a customer who is leaving]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Come back! [Opens another door for a nanny]
Paco: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry to have put you in your place, but you'll have to stay.
Mr. Krabs: I thought you'd never ask. [Opens a door for Mrs. Puff who drops her drink] I know you're both very sorry, but you're going to have to make ends meet to stay and, uhh, bathe in the sunset. [Hands Mr. Krabs a bill] Uh, how much do you want?
Paco: How much?
Mr. Krabs: And what does it cost?
Paco: $1.50.
Mr. Krabs: Well, how do I look like scraping the dark?
[The mini Krabby Patties empty. The customers are screaming and yelling. The police are on the other side of the road so there is more police cars, etc.]
Mr. Krabs: That's enough! [Hands Mr. Puff a ticket]
Mrs. Puff: Thanks!
Mr. Krabs: I didn't know the streets were the same as the old man. Go on, drive by the newest and greatest.
[Mr. Krabs drives past once again as the Krusty Krab empties its bank.]
Mr. Krabs: I feel so secure. [Looks at the money] Cash register.
[The money falls out of the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs comes out naked.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] The dark! The dark!
[Mr. Krabs runs out of the Krusty Krab naked. Plankton comes in with a plate full of chum]
Plankton: Chum?! No! Nooo! [lets go of the chum and yelps
