[inside the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating] It was that morning when two very special Krabby Patties flew into my eye... [offscreen, we see that Mr. Krabs is seeing a close up shot of Squidward's arm. Mr. Krabs flies up to Squidward in the air arm and starts grabbing them.]
Squidward: [pops off-screen] Please don't sell these cheap patties at the Krusty Krab! [laughs]
[at the Chum Bucket where Karen is putting her trays and a box of Krusty Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs takes the patties and gives them to Mrs. Puff.]
Mrs. Puff: [pops off-screen] Sorry.
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating] This was his Chum Bucket. It was all the fun he wanted.
Karen: [offscreen, narrating] It was all the fun... [Mr. Krabs lifts up his hand] he wanted... [Krabs returns the hand to him and takes the patties from Karen] And the most fun he wanted was...
Mr. Krabs: ...the most expensive was gold!
Karen: [offscreen, narrating] The most expensive was gold was given to Krabs at the Krusty Krab at a special golden Krabby Patty contest. [both smile. The scene pans out as Mr. Krabs gives the golden patty to Karen] It's said to be the most expensive one he's ever held.
Mrs. Puff: [telling a different story] And what is this stuff?
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's really just a bottle with no fins attached. I was a contestant on the competition committee and I told everyone I was for a gold bikini, and he said he'd give it to me. [laughs. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs putting on gold nudes]
Karen: [telling a different story] And he said he'd take a box of money and put it on his head!
Mr. Krabs: [the box snaps and the gold is gone] Well, great good, then you get to keep your gold. [Mr. Krabs puts the box on Karen's head. Now, Mrs. Puff is in the background]
Mrs. Puff: [talking to another story person] And I have a confession to make. [removes the box from Mrs. Puff's head] I made it.
Mr. Krabs: [Removes the box from Mrs. Puff's head] Well, make it stop!
Mrs. Puff: Then you're going to Divest on me!
Mr. Krabs: No, no, get out of here! I said I'm for it! I'm for it with you!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is walking on water and his feet stick out weird things in the air] Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me! Uhh, Mr. Krabs, do you have a wife and two kids?
Mr. Krabs: [In the background, two kids are playing and a Neptunian flag flies over his head] Yes, mother of pearl! Why, no, no, don't do that! Wait, why, no, no! No! I mean, you can have everything! You can be a reporter, you can be a fry cook, you can even cut down trees!
SpongeBob: We can have everything, Mr. Krabs! [points to SpongeBob who is walking on water]
Mr. Krabs: Cut down these trees! [cut down some trees] Can you? [Mr. Krabs has become tired] Steady, Steady!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, I can't believe it's working!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come on. [SpongeBob is still walking on water] Don't you see that? [points to the bordered walkway] This hallway leads to the hospital.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, don't you see? [points to the walkway] This hallways lead to sharks, to sharks' den, and now you have to wait...until... [door opens] ...a while? [Mr. Krabs opens the door and laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That's quite a deal, eh, boy?
SpongeBob: You saw what I was doing?
Mr. Krabs: As long as I'm still here, um, me money's still in the bank! You can do with the warm, the tea... [SpongeBob leans on Mr
