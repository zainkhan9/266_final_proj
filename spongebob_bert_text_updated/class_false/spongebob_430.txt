[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is singing to a little girl riding his bike. He makes the expression "krabs long" with a dash of pride.]
Kids: ♪Mama Krabs, ma Krabs! Whoo-hoo! Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties!♪ [crushed] Mr. Krabs! [his face turns into Plankton's face and walks away, still sounding his voice] What am I going to do? I can't go to the party with you fat cats!
[Mr. Krabs gets up, splashing bags of money together. Plankton then grabs a clipboard and a pen, holding up paperprints.]
Plankton: [holding up paperprints] All done! [walks away] Why, thank you, Mr. Krabs. [walks into the kitchen] Oh, I'm so glad you were able to give me a heads-up! [turns on microphone] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to go to the party!
[Plankton turns on microphone and peaks through the ceiling at SpongeBob and Squidward laughing. The scene skips to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is all prepared for the party. He sees SpongeBob and Squidward trying to get into the ballroom.]
Mr. Krabs: Let's go to the party!
[Squidward and SpongeBob wait in fear. Mr. Krabs takes the leave of the table and goes inside.]
Mr. Krabs: It's time to kick out the remainder of the lazy! [holds up a pile of money] Let's see how customers order us—
[Mr. Krabs notices SpongeBob and Squidward trying to get in the ballroom.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmph. Try the register.
SpongeBob: But they charge ten bucks more!
[Mr. Krabs lifts up his pile of money and screams in rage.]
Squidward: [holds up money] How about ten dollars?
SpongeBob: [sells his balls] I'm a lazy guy.
[Mr. Krabs gets so mad, he clings onto the table again and grunts]
Mr. Krabs: What's the matter, boy? And what's the matter?
Squidward: Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [gulps] Oh, this is a stupid ball. [clings onto the table] And you're a ball loser. [clings onto the table again] Why, you're a paying customer. [gulps] Well, I guess I'm not Pay What You Wish's at It. [gulps] I give you ten dollars for your stupid ball.
[Mr. Krabs goes outside to get more balls.]
Mr. Krabs: Here it is, my ball: Plankton!
Plankton: Thanks, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: Go ahead, put 'em in, boy. [sets the balls in a pile] In there, boy.
[Mr. Krabs drives the extra speed, but the balls fly out the way they were.]
Plankton: Good driving range.
[Mr. Krabs climbs up, walks over to SpongeBob's house, and puts them in. He puts them on ags a large tract bus, which is heading towards the pineapple. He drives the bus all the way across the street to the Krusty Krab. He passes by the Krusty Krab once he's finished putting the tricorn clock.]
Plankton: Excuse me, sir, but can you start the game fast? Penalty? Only 4:00 tomorrow? Duty? My career is ruined. I can't even be bothered to eat. [stomach grumbles. He slithers over to the door, and opens it, to SpongeBob] I shall do him.
[SpongeBob peeks the door, but the door is too big for him to see. Mr. Krabs opens the door, and SpongeBob peeks the door, but the door is too big for him to see.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're too light. Go get a fireman.
[Mr. Krabs lets SpongeBob walk away. The scene changes to SpongeBob sleeping in his bed at night, but awake comes at last. SpongeBob dreams that he's at the Krusty Krab, playing "The Nutcracker Suite!" as customers laugh and cheer at SpongeBob. SpongeBob's dream ends, and he awakens to find himself being held at gunpoint by three armed customers. He tries to call for help, but
