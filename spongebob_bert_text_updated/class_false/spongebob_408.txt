Version #1 (Original),"The Chum Bucket Incident"
[At nighttime, SpongeBob and Patrick are waking up in the Chum Bucket. Patrick is trying to sneak out of the house, but SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are busy stealing the formula from him. SpongeBob and Patrick moan in terror as they are about to swallow the formula, fall into pieces, and then gush out some more warm water.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's over!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs quietly watch the episode head on. The scene changes to nighttime. A fish pulls the strings at the Chum Bucket. The Chum Bucket is now a prison that's all but empty since the breakout. The Warden is gluing the doors and windows of the prisons around the prisoners. The prisons are already torn about what they're in.]
Warden: All right, then lock them up.
SpongeBob: Release them?
Warden: Well, they can all stay up in this chum bucket until dawn. [writes a couple of tired faces a threat] Alright, them. I want you to hold on until tomorrow. [gestures to Gary]
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob pretends to ignore him and holds onto Gary]
Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob. Gary's a slob. [poses] He's mine now. [closes Gary's door]
Warden: Alright, kids, today is your day off!
SpongeBob: Oh, I just got off work. [puts Gary on the ground]
Warden: Don't worry, kid. You'll be safe when you're gone. [walks out]
SpongeBob: Bye, Warden. [leaves]
Warden: And may my friend, the man who made the Chum Bucket, rest in peace, the Chum Bucket. [closes the door and resumes work]
SpongeBob: I'm getting paid, too much to live in fear. [cut to SpongeBob walking down the street] Is this a good idea, Warden?
Warden: Oh, it sure is. When I saw your new flat, I knew I could no longer live here. [walks away]
SpongeBob: What's he doing?
Warden: Rentating the old flat? [walks over to SpongeBob's house] Oh, he's so sorry.
SpongeBob: He seems to have forgotten that his old room had hospitality once again. [SpongeBob begins to eat when a hose squirts water on his flat. SpongeBob pops up and covers himself with cheese]
Warden: Leave him, son.
SpongeBob: He'll thank me for this hotel room.
Warden: Oh, he wouldn't forget that. Oh, his flat was ruined by his daring said treacherous critter. [Warden's head explodes with DNA]
Fish #1: Sorry.
Warden: Listen up, Nitin-- [looks at the time] Wait a minute! Nitin' shrimp. Nitin' shrimp. [Turns around and points to a clock in the middle of the room] Silly nitwits out there, you filthy invertebrate! [Turns around and points to the next day] Today is the day that people will remember my name and remember my grit and your pathetic attempt to run a pet shop.
Fish #2: Uh, yeah, me plants don't talk!
[Man Ray comes in]
Man Ray: Hey, what're you talking about?
[SpongeBob and Patrick start talking about SpongeBob and Patrick and Man Ray and Man Ray start laughing at each other]
SpongeBob: Oh, Man Ray!
Warden: Why, hello, Man Ray!
Man Ray: I'm... not... That Man! [Thinks for a second] Yes?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [continue laughing]
Warden: And we're going to believe that there's a cure-all for your horrible laughter!
Man Ray: No, no, no, it's not time to look for it. Get it? Cure-all!
[Patrick and SpongeBob start laughing simultaneously and the time capsule explodes gets pushed away from the ramp. The ramp gets repositioned so that it can get mobile again. The ramp then goes into a state of explosion. The time capsule explodes into a pile of popcorn and Patrick begins to laugh out loud]
Patrick: Mooooooooo.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Man Ray: He's gonna explode into a giant flower or something.
SpongeBob: Yeah! He's gonna go... explode? [laughs] Wait! He's not exploding. He's just falling to the bottom! [tries to pick up the flower, but it appears to be stuck to the top
