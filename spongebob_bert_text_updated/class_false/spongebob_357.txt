SpongeBob: [Whispering] I've got something for you, Squidward. [Squidward hands SpongeBob a piece of paper]
Squidward: [reading the paper] "When I'm finished, you'll be as a sponge as you've ever seen." That's me, SpongeBob SquarePants. That's me! [SpongeBob walks up to Squidward] I know you've come to expect me at your service, but can you give me a handshake? [SpongeBob straightens his neck by a strip while Squidward laughs. Squidward takes the strip and gives SpongeBob as many times as he can. Scene cuts to an excercycle as many times as Squidward takes the strip] You're the man!
Squidward: What? No, what?
Mr. Krabs: And don't you come close with your hand at my expense!
Squidward: Fine! [clicks his finger]
Mr. Krabs: What? No!
SpongeBob: [whispering] I've got something for you, Squidward.
Squidward: What? Your hand?
Mr. Krabs: Your hand?
SpongeBob: Of course.
Squidward: No! That's not an invitation!
Mr. Krabs: What?
SpongeBob: And I've got a glove for that.
Squidward: No!
Mr. Krabs: [whispering] Don't bring it on!
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, glove already put in for you.
Squidward: [he walks closer to the Krusty Krab] Don't bring it on! [SpongeBob closes the glove box as Mr. Krabs sees him through the window] Incoming!
SpongeBob: Hmmm. Hmm?
Squidward: [he tries to open the glove, but it isn't possible] You!? You can't!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I think I can fit you on the glove. [Squidward tears off the gum off his hand]
SpongeBob: Thank you.
Squidward: Well, I'm not a stick in the mud anymore. I'm a ball of dynamite that you can touch.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah? Well, you're in. Now how about a nice warm apology? [gives Mr. Krabs a tissue, then he begins to write on it]
Squidward: Aww, silly devil. That's a lot of paper to take out.
Mr. Krabs: Oh yeah? Well I... You know what? No... [he starts to sweat] ...you're perching me glove! Please, come back! That's my glove!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I can't take it anymore!
Squidward: [He pushes Mr. Krabs out of the Krusty Krab] Please, come back here! That's my home. Now, come back hun? [Squidward walks back into the Krusty Krab. Scene cuts to a couple standing in line at a fast food restaurant]
Tina: I want a Krabby Patty.
Sandals: Hey, look.
Harold: We want our food here.,,,,,,,,...[runs up long line]
Fred: Our food here?
Tom: Itâ€™s delicious!
Harold: My patty is ruined!
Sandals: Mr. Krabs, you're disrupting me business!
Mr. Krabs: Afraid so. Bye, boys!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry tonight, and I'm also sorry today, and I look forward to continuing to work here, as usual.
Mr. Krabs: All right, all right. [shakes hands] I hope you find this pleasant.
SpongeBob and Squidward: Hooray!
SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Good night, Mr. Krabs. [shakes his hand]
Mr. Krabs: Hooray.
SpongeBob: Eh, Squidward.
Squidward: I'll stop tsk-tsing myself. [hops off and reappears by SpongeBob and Squidward, who are now ashamed] I hope this is over. [gasps] I didn't make any of this better. Better than this!
SpongeBob: Squidward, you made me better. And you better lock me out. Now go out. Show somebody your feelings.
