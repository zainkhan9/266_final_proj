[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs comes in as usual and greets the customers with dishes that are either very good or very good at what they do. He dips his hat into the sink and boils some ketchup.]
Jim said... [Spoken] Uh, hey, fellas, how's the grill?
SpongeBob said... [Growling] Uh, oh.
Jim: Oh, man. Must be hot. [Walks past Sandy who is actually sleeping through the window]
SpongeBob: [Walks upstairs and sees Sandy with plates that say... [Gurgling] Bless You, Sandy, Bless You, and Sandy, Bless You are So Close] Huh? [Gasp!]
Sandy: Holy Moly! [Gasp!]
SpongeBob: Oh, I love this song! [Sandy blinks and spits out a bunch of bubbles] Missed a spot! [She giggles and wipes her eyes] Ooh, hey, Sandy, what're you doing this morning?
Sandy: Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I need to- [She rips off his pants and shoes and puts them back on]
SpongeBob: I need you to... [She rips off his socks and shoes again and puts them back on. SpongeBob gasps] I'm getting my legs ready.
Sandy: I'm ready! [SpongeBob runs off] I've got it! [She starts running with Mr. Krabs' shoe. They go over a high-tension treadmill, but it TOUCH the treadmill and you puts it on before you start to go. The pair start to pace you until Mr. Krabs' arm falls and you have to run on it. You start crawling on the treadmill, but it curtails you when you go first. You go all over Mr. Krabs and his office and into a long line. You stop at a door that says 'House of Triumph' and it says 'House of Triumph.' The line goes until it reaches the front door. Mr. Krabs is angry that he can't get outside of the line. He breaks his pose again and this time, he is not there. He is sweating with a monitor on his head, and he pulls it back with one of his claws. The look on his face gives Mr. Krabs an idea. He decides to show him around the restaurant. He goes inside] Ta-da! [The customers are still bored] Ah, but I've seen the Krabby Patties before in an old man's kitchen. [Mr. Krabs is holding a Krabby Patty and it starts to smell like burnt patties] What is this horrible smell? [Chuckles nervously. The patty starts to shimmer and the screen fades to black. Mr. Krabs is completely disgusted, and he runs over to SpongeBob as they both look out through the telescope] Come on, SpongeBob! Taste my claws! What's that horrible smell?
SpongeBob: It's my claws!
Sandy: [Over the radio] Krabs, I need to know, is this some kind of joke, or is it some secret code?
Mr. Krabs: It's a secret code. All you've been ranting and raving about. For days I've been it's been...Patrick! [The screensaver that comes with the Thinker shows up]
Patrick: [off-screen] I don't know! What do you think you're doing with those boobs?
SpongeBob: I had no idea! They make a mascot.
Patrick: Oh, hey, SpongeBob, two can play at playing. [SpongeBob stretches his arm and two cans of ketchup are thrown at Patrick's head. Patrick's head gets stretched and he falls and explodes]
Mr. Krabs: She's gone! Oh, she's no match for the handsome, cultured man who believes in art and reason. I don't think I can blame him. But I can fix our growing business. And we can all chuckle along. [Mr. Krabs laughs]
SpongeBob: Hey, where'd that Italian dude go?
Karen: He was after me. And me.
SpongeBob: And who are those two better off without?
Karen: The bottom-feeders.
SpongeBob: What about the original maven?
Karen: What now?
SpongeBob: What's changed?
Karen: The look.
SpongeBob: The face. [Both look worried]
Karen: I say we separate!
Patrick: No, I don't think so.
Karen: [screams]
SpongeBob: Stand back, please!
[SpongeBob and Patrick stand back; he then crouches
