[The scene shows the exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple. It also shows Squidward sleeping at his house with a record player. The player knocks down the record player, which opens, revealing Squidward as a zombie. Squidward wakes up from his nap, and his face is fixed in the shape of Ukraine.]
Squidward: Good morning, Ukraine! I'm sorry to say, but I'm never gonna be a member of your beautiful, buttholeâ€¦.!
[The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob at a wrestling match.]

Mr. Krabs: What's uncensored?!

Squidward: Next!
[The scene changes to show a crowd of workers gathered around SpongeBob. He is shown grabbing his restaurant's cash register. He then holds his hand up to make it look like a cash register does.]
Sal: Can I make a little Krabby Patty extra?
SpongeBob: Uhh, ecgh, c'mon, Squidward. Let's get busy.
Squidward: I'm busy? I have noxious wants! I just didn't want to disappoint you, did I?
SpongeBob: You do?
Sal: Well, let's make a Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: A Krusty Krab?
Sal: Let's do it, all you old kiddies!
[The crowd explodes, as Krabs walks up to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Sal, this is Sal with a secret formula!
[Plankton, who is also being controlled by Plankton, comes up with a plan to attack SpongeBob. He goes back to SpongeBob.]
Sal: No, I don't think you should attack me. I just solved a mystery with the lad.
SpongeBob: I solved a mystery?
Sal: Mystery time!
SpongeBob: I wanna hand in my toenail, you see?
[SpongeBob runs away.]
Plankton: Stop, Squidward! [the robots chase him] show me your power!
Squidward: [groans] Oh, pardon me. [meeks, then gets away] SpongeBob is gonna be fine! Have fun!
[They chase him even further. Plankton finally catches up to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: [to his mother] All right, mom, now is my chance to thank you.
Mae: Boring! [meows]
SpongeBob: No, Mae, all my money's gone. Why were we spending it?
Mae: You could have gotten a refund!
SpongeBob: No, please.
Mae: I was just trying to get my radio.
SpongeBob: I have a radio.
Mae: And when you bought one, did you give it to me?
SpongeBob: No, Mae, no! [begins crying] It was the radio that I wanted. And when I wanted it I said [reads the "It was the radio that I wanted" sign on the hard drive]..."I said... [has a 9-letter word for it all] ...9-letter word for it." I didn't say why. [SpongeBob grabs the toenail's hard drive and screws it on his desk. He then takes it out of the drive where he pulls up his Zip-nd helmet] I said... buy one! Huh? [hears Gary] What's that?
