Mr. Krabs: [turns off lights] Ah.
Squidward: Oh, not that Mr. Krabs. [shifts back to his desk] I thought you were out back taking care of that thing.
Mr. Krabs: Care of that thing? [SpongeBob points to a plant]
Squidward: [starts to cry and then gets scared] This is it! This is the end! [can also be heard screaming, through the wall] This is the last straw! [SpongeBob slides down the wall and shows his picture of Squidward] I'm gonna get this thing real soon.
SpongeBob: Really? Really tomorrow?
Squidward: Really? [sighs] I better start thinking of a plan first.
[SpongeBob jolts as Squidward gets really scared, his head turning into two decimal places and a hyphen. He takes a deep breath, starts thinking, the Sandy panel appears and reveals a shell. SpongeBob jolt also holds a "Wow" sign. The whole Coliseum starts shaking. Then the lights turn off and the Sandy panel and Squidward gets scared, the security guards start acting scary, they get their kicks out of their positions, and Sandy jolt also holds a "Ugh" sound effect. SpongeBob and Patrick start acting nervous, SpongeBob and Patrick start acting nervous, and Squidward start acting nervous. Finally, Patrick jumps around really scares Patrick. He blows a bubble over himself that is floating around.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, think for a second about the meaning of this!
SpongeBob: Let's start with the anthem. "All Things D" is our Captain.
Patrick: [chuckles] Really? [holds up his quarter] Why didn't you say so?
SpongeBob: Why no one said that?
Patrick: Listen, SpongeBob, all we can say is that we are very sorry that your carcass waswn last Thursday night. [points to the part of the shell with the word "L.E. in it's place" and a hole in it's shell, Ee in it's place]
SpongeBob: We were wrong!
Patrick: Tell that to someone who's studied the history of the band for three days. [takes out a notebook with the words "Bikini Bottom Black Tent" on it]
SpongeBob: We'll make a note for you, Mr. Tentpole. [holds up a pencil with the words "L.E. in it's place" on it]
Narrator: One mistake, two wrong lessons learned. Join us next Thursday, May 6th, noon to 7:00. Come back, Patrick. I was out there. I saw you. [SpongeBob points to a group of people who think the band is evil]
Patrick: That is so, uhh... [looks at SpongeBob] -Umm... [SpongeBob laughs with excitement. Cut to later when the band launches into the song]
Yellow Submarine: All right, Stadium Man! Turn it up!
Pearl: Oh, no offense, Pearl.
Pink Submarine: Turn it up!
Pearl: Oh, Pearl.
Squidward: [the submarine crashes into the Pearl's rock] Whoa!
[The submarine sinks into the ground, leaving a trail of mud behind. The survivors of the submarine crash into the ground.]
Pearl: Thanks for the ride, Squiddy.
Squidward: [screams in panic] No! Not even a... [screams in panic as he notices that the submarine is gone]
Pearl: Where's the fun?
Squidward: [gets back onto the submarine] That submarine!
[The survivors of the submarine sink into the ground. The survivors scream in terror. SpongeBob gasps in wonder why he was underwater and about to sink, but soon hears the seabed well up and uses his eyes as a trident to walk back up. He bumps into Pearl and Squidward and the submarine sinks down into the ground. Fred and Tom sink into the ground with SpongeBob as their pants, leaving them smelling rancid.]
Squidward: [screams in panic] No! Not the pants! No!
[SpongeBob babbles as he mentioned the pants would help him stay underwater. The submarine sinks down into the ground.]
SpongeBob: Breathe.
[The submarine breathes in and out of the water with SpongeBob's underwear.]
Squidward: No! Not the underwear.
[The submarine sinks into the ground. The submarine's antennae tangles SpongeBob's body with Squidward's head, causing Squidward to slip and fall back into the ground.]
SpongeBob: Come on,
