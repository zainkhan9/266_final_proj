<Start Ep> (SpongeBob and Patrick walk into the Krusty Krab. The scene changes to SpongeBob looking through a microscope and seeing Squidward's face as a ghost. Squidward is shown looking at SpongeBob. The scene changes to Squidward on the clarinet. He is telling the story of his life.]
Squidward: My life is a living nightmare.
Mermaid #1: Why, brother, it's not really so bad!
Squidward: [He is shown in his living room. He is talking while putting his change into his pocket] It's not that bad! It's- It's... It's, uh...it's, uh...not that bad! [He sighs] It's not that bad!
Mermaid #1: [While he opens the coat hanger] You have to read more.
Squidward: More like Open Me Closet. [Writing on the instrument a note] "Close up."
Mermaid Leader: What is it, my dear?
Squidward: Why, it's just a silly clarinet. Just a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly,!" [Reading from the Clarinet.] "Now listen. When I'm driving... [Taps the tire squeal with the clarinet and hears it coming, then looks at his watch]
Mermaid Leader: Now it's not so bad. They should sing more songs like that.
Squidward: Oh, brother..
Mermaid Leader: Okay, now you're talking. You're not going to the concert. You can't just wander around like that. You have to be my friend.
Squidward: You're right, friend? I need your help. uh...
Mermaid Leader: Listen carefully. We're going to the...
Squidward: Oh brother, oh, I almost forgot. the mermaids are right over...
Mermaid Leader: You need to sing a song for the ladies, brother.
[Mermaid Leader attempts to sing. He is unsuccessful. The Mermalairair couple are suspicious and Squidward becomes scared, and runs away, then comes back and sees SpongeBob doing his song again]
SpongeBob: Oh, again? [Squidward tugs his ears] Huh! Squidward, are you okay?
Squidward: Yes. Thanks.
SpongeBob: That's it.
French narrator: Two hours later...
[Squidward is now thinking and hears the commotion in his room. He goes to read the newspaper, but someone knocks on the door and knocks back the doors. Squidward opens his window and sees the mermaids and his head begins to hurt]
Squidward: Mom. Mom. [Pulls out his clarinet and his clarinet starts clanging. He opens the door, but it's locked] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Mom?
Squidward: You can't go in there!
SpongeBob: I-I've got a condition called Point Pleasant-ness. It doesn't work.
Squidward: [turns around and looks at his reflection on his mirror] Ha. Uhh... it doesn't work.
SpongeBob: Point-blank range, I'm sure.
Squidward: Uh, thank you.
[SpongeBob continues to yell at the mermaids as if he's a dog]
SpongeBob: Point-blank, point-blank, point-blank.
Squidward: Go ahead, say it, but you're my favorite. I am.
SpongeBob: Me?
Squidward: Sure. Why don't you go ahead and let me bask in the glory of my great-great-great-grandfather?
SpongeBob: I was just kidding. You don't know anything unusual about music. I've been playing it all my life.
Squidward: What's a music enthusiast?
SpongeBob: Um, yeah, I call myself a music lover, a music enthusiast, a guy who likes his records. [laughs]
Squidward: You're a guy?
SpongeBob: Sure. My... um, my... um... My clarinet.
Squidward: Yeah, the sound of which... [pauses]
SpongeBob: Well, I did it, quizz. It's me, SpongeBob.
Squidward: Then it's your great-great-great-great-great grandfather.
SpongeBob: Great-great grandfather? I mean, really.
Squidward: Well, back to the point. Say, is there something I should do?
SpongeBob: Anything?
Squidward: The same thing
