[episode starts with SpongeBob getting ready for bed. A thunderstorm is heard. Patrick wakes up and notices the damage.] 
Patrick: SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?!
SpongeBob: [humming] Oh, I'm just grilling patties, man.
Patrick: Patties?! [SpongeBob grabs the lead singer single and blows the meat into his hamburger]
SpongeBob: [singing] Spaghetti squash party, apple pie, kettle bell, and rougleybaile! 
[the episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick both playing "patties" and "patties", SpongeBob blows the meat into his ears, Patrick starts eating his fruit juice, SpongeBob hops into his treehouse and breaks a treehouse window, both of them dance and share the funfair with SpongeBob until they hit a obstruction. They pop open the door and it breaks its own horn, they then both wink and wink at each other all night. During the night, SpongeBob and Patrick seem to get along a great deal.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. I think I'm getting a M. Night shined all over this place. It's like a ghost town in here! 
[about Patrick and SpongeBob until 6:00 in the morning. SpongeBob stares out the window and sees Patrick's foghorn alarm clock ringing.] 
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Uh, Patrick, what are you doing? 
Patrick: I'm waiting here. 
SpongeBob: What are you waiting here for? 
Patrick: I can't answer that. 
SpongeBob: It's another matter... 
Patrick: I might have more time to buy some ice packs later. 
SpongeBob: Well, what are you doing now, Patrick? 
Patrick: I have no choice. 
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're acting stupid. 
Patrick: Not at me anymore. [both run over and get into the back of the boat, while SpongeBob takes the steering wheel] 
SpongeBob: What are you doing, again? 
Patrick: I have no choice. 
SpongeBob: What are you doing now, again? 
Patrick: I have to take the curb back. 
SpongeBob: No, that's not what you said. [takes the steering wheel] 
Patrick: Shift shift shift shift shift shift shift. 
SpongeBob: Ain't that the only way to get around this place? 
Patrick: Well, why don't you ask me later, if I really want to get my hands on that... [Patrick takes off the bottle] 
SpongeBob: I got it. [Patrick takes it from him] 
Patrick: Uh-huh. [drops it] 
SpongeBob: Pat, this isn't working. 
[the whole group of people is standing there, in a total confusion] 
Patrick: I said "shift shift shift shift." 
SpongeBob: Pat, didn't you tell me you had a "shift shift" shift? 
Patrick: Well, don't get your hands on that bottle. It's a lie.
SpongeBob: Don't you know that it's a lie? 
Patrick: Well, if I shift my hand up and down, and it comes up again, and it says "shift shift shift", then will the rest of my hands say anything?
SpongeBob: [in a really loud and annoying voice] Shift my hand to another direction, and it says "shift shift". 
Patrick: Duh. [giggles]
SpongeBob: That's not so bad, Patrick. I can already hear myself say "shift shift". 
[both start to imitating each other]
Patrick: That's not so bad, SpongeBob. I can already hear myself say "shift shift". 
SpongeBob: That's not so bad, Patrick. I can already hear myself say "shift shift". 
[continues imitating]
Patrick: Shift shift shift shift. 
SpongeBob: Yeah, you can already hear yourself say that. "I'm not good enough." 
Patrick: Well, then, why don't you just shift into that boat and dock all set? 
SpongeBob: Great! 
[they imitating each other make an amazing set. They sit on the dock, in front of an old building.] 
Patrick: That looks like an old building. 
SpongeBob: Why don't you just shift into that boat and get some sleep? 
[they imitating each other. They get tired from imitating, so SpongeBob uses a lamp to turn the light on. The old
