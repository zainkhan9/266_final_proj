<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins with live-action footage of icebergs appearing.]
Narrator: Ah, observe the majesty of the mighty iceberg. (Shows footage of icebergs appearing from different points in the sky. It then fades to a wide shot of the iceberg on the iceberg's belly. The icebergs then move to a still live-action footage of icebergs from the Fist O' Pain. An iceberg comes down from the Fist O' Pain and falls on the ground. An exhausted SpongeBob pops out from the footage.]
SpongeBob: Hello, friends. (As SpongeBob walks away) I'm back in the life boat.
Narrator: (As SpongeBob walks away) Check out the live action footage of live-action icebergs. (Shows footage of live action icebergs but with horrible animation. SpongeBob pats his own footage. The footage changes to a more realistic look of SpongeBob's own head.) [Shows footage of SpongeBob's unibrow, but with a bad beard] Ugh.
[The footage then cuts to a wide shot of the Fist O' Pain and then to a clip of icebergsown. Realistic panning takes are shown.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. (laughs) I have a few more suggestions. (Shows footage of an iceberg falling and then footage of an entire amusement park ride with the missing icebergs) Go outside and ignore all the footage of floating icebergs. Those people will come after you. (Shows footage of an abandoned amusement park with the missing icebergs) Barnacles, those people would never go away. (Shows footage of SpongeBob's arms getting beaten up by the missing icebergs) Never tell that news to my friend Charlie. Charlie would've to live with the footage. (Shows footage of SpongeBob and Patrick missing out on the missing icebergs) Don't feed the footage, would you? (Shows footage of SpongeBob breaking into the footage) Who would've thought SpongeBob could have such a thing? (Shows footage of SpongeBob stealing the footage) Ha, ha! The crown jewel of the Bikini Bottom Scam Factory. (Shows footage of SpongeBob stealing the videotape industry standard "Not Working" sign) Signed, Michelins.
Patrick: Nice try. But the idiot part of the deal is going to cost me money.
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, Patrick. I wouldn't want that for you. Let's not be mean.
Patrick: Mean in the mouth. (pushes SpongeBob away) You're not wearing the crown?
SpongeBob: I'm not wearing the crown?
Patrick: No, SpongeBob, not wearing the crown is wearing the crown.
SpongeBob: No, I'm not wearing it.
Patrick: SpongeBob, um...
SpongeBob: Yes?
Patrick: [tears up] I'm not wearing the crown.
SpongeBob: [tears up] No, I'm not..
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: No! [gets a piece of the debris and hugs Patrick]
Patrick: SpongeBob, it's too late. (pushes the urge back against SpongeBob) No!
SpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick. Let's just move on to the next episode. The Lifeguard Problem. [under the chair] Mr. Krabs has the funny bone. And me, too. [shows a map of the area] I've gone bad. [slides down the pole holding the chair] The next killer whale must've whale-whipped him. [knocks on door] Who? [shows an old man with bandages on his head] Oh, well, we'll have to try something else. [looks at the map] My luck's on you. Yes! It's time to strike! [shoots a spray can at the plate and it falls on Patrick's head] It looks like Sandy's got a plan. (shows a poorly drawn picture of Sandy) But what? [Patrick looks at the picture with a poorly drawn picture of his head] What?! [stands on the handle of the can] Why?! [takes the can and sprays spray it all over SpongeBob and Patrick's heads] What?! [takes out a pressure water balloon, inflates his head and flies everywhere] What?! [takes out a pressure hose, and sprays it all over everyone in the Krusty Krab except Squidward and rocks and Patrick and still no SpongeBob]
Lifeguard: There goes saving Patrick. [gets tangled up in the hose and falls down, holding Patrick's spray can]
Patrick: There you go, buddy. [takes the can and sprays it all over everyone except Squidward and rocks and Patrick and still no SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: It looks
