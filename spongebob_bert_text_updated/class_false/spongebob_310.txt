[the episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to work]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick.
Patrick: [thinking] Oh, boy! I'm tired.
SpongeBob: Thinking that we're gonna exhaustion?
Patrick: Well, a little?
SpongeBob: It's not that you're not equipped to do all that said work says it can do. [thinking, doingze off, then waking up] Well, at least I have my arm around partially dismantled bodies.
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: And my skeleton. [thinking, he slithers over to a pile of dumpsters and comes back with his eyeballs. He picks them up and uses them to put boots on them] Hey, Patrick, that's me! Yeah. Great, I'm ready. [laughs]
Patrick: [thinking, he slithers back to his pile of junk] I'll show you how. [puts an arm around SpongeBob's arm and grabs a can of snail-nip jelly] How do you like me, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh... [thinking, he slithers up to Patrick's can]
Patrick: Snailnip jelly?
SpongeBob: Mm, Great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great. Okay, Patrick, if that's how you like it, fine. With uh... ahh... ahh... [getting stretched] ...ahh... [speaking in a low voice] Squirrel Time. [Patrick gives a dirty one] Okay, you like it, squirrel. With ahh... ahh... [speaking in a high voice] Whatever.
Patrick: [dirty] This is embarrassing! [SpongeBob gets angry] I think you're over-analyzing my evidence. Here, let me demonstrate to you how the classic rulebook rules for the study of backyard ham... [one side shows a page with a red flag pointing to a hill and the other with a green flag pointing to a mountain] ...actually measure up there. [a shadow is shown with two red and green flags. He lifts one up] That's what we're there for!
SpongeBob: [raising his right hand] That's not very nice.
Patrick: Oh, try as we might, we have to put up a stop to it.
SpongeBob: Why not? [raising his left hand more] It's just as beautiful as hammy.
Patrick: Well, maybe we can show you a little about yourselves.
SpongeBob: I belong to a town that prides itself on being green. [shaking a tire, Frank leaves the scene and Patrick returns to his normal attitude] I'm the most curious of all citizens. Why are we here, in this town?!
Patrick: I'm going to raise this hill, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: But, but, but, but, but, but, but... [crosses his arms] We're not starting any new buildings, Patrick.
Patrick: No, but...we're still working on that.
SpongeBob: It would take more than a shrug.
Patrick: I can't help it, Grandma. I take um... [grabs SpongeBob's elbow and pulls it back before he does]
SpongeBob: Don't you think that, just because we have a brick in your hand, that's not the point, Patrick? Because I have more in me life than that brick... [throws the brick at the wall, which spins around until it hits Patrick's hand] ...what about the brick?
Patrick: [throws it back] I don't care how you slice it!
SpongeBob: Just don't put it in the oven!
[The brick bounces around before hitting SpongeBob's body. SpongeBob, in an attempt to stop the fight, grabs an ice cream cone and throws it at Patrick's hand.]
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick! Stop! [grabs Patrick's hand] Put it in the oven!
[The rock starts to melt, revealing ice cream in it. Itcolooms it out and reveals that SpongeBob is hitting Patrick's forehead.]
Patrick: Ow! [slaps SpongeBob, knocking him over]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob making amends with ice cream in his hand. He makes another ice cream cone, but this time, ice cream is in the shape of his head.]
Ice Cream: [coughs] Ow.
SpongeBob: [makes something out of ice cream] Oh, that's just horrible! I'd better get back to work and get those dandruff legs! [laughs and bounces off]
[SpongeBob goes to get some ice cream, but gets stopped by Patrick.]
Patrick: Dandruff! [throws
