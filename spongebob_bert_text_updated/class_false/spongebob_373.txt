[The scene begins with a medium shot of SpongeBob. He peaks out of a telescope at the three children. SpongeBob grabs one of them and looks through the binoculars.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [screams as he gets hit in the head by a toy eel] Ow! [chuckles]
[The other children stare menacingly as two elderly fish dump pop through the front window, their faces mask from sight. An eel squeals and SpongeBob races to stop the show before it's too late.]
Children: We want our money!
[SpongeBob races back to the stage and pushes the controls buttons. The eels emerge from the binoculars and bark excitedly. SpongeBob races closer to the exit but they put him back on the edge. Cuts to SpongeBob's vision as he watches a movie.]
SpongeBob: You could knock them off your tables like this.
[SpongeBob jumps onto the back of an old truck and starts ramming it into the window with his piston. The truck falls backwards, spins around, and then stays in the window. SpongeBob then jumps onto the tractor beam and starts rumbling and rumbling loudly. He then climbs up to the tractor beam's motor, and does the same. He repeatedly pound on the motor, causing it to break. SpongeBob then struggles to control the tractor beam. The tractor beam keeps ramming SpongeBob off and he reaches the truck's roof. The truck passes SpongeBob, but crashes into the front fender. SpongeBob's head hits the brake and causes the roof to flip off before reaching the ground. SpongeBob then reaches for the motor and does it properly. The truck's gasoline tank gets filled up again and gets to the top of the ladder. SpongeBob keeps climbing up to the motor and doing different things with it. He keeps climbing up until his gasoline tank gets empty. The gasoline tank gets filled up using the hose in the back of the motor. SpongeBob keeps doing various jumpshots with the motor until he reaches the top. He keeps running around until he reaches the gas tank. The gasoline tank gets filled up again, gasping for air as he runs up to the gas tank. SpongeBob stops running until he reaches the gas tank. The tank is filled up again, then gasps as he runs back up to the gas tank. SpongeBob stops running again until he reaches the gas tank. The gasoline tank fills up like a balloon and SpongeBob stops running. The citizens of Bikini Bottom look at SpongeBob in the window as they race to the truck. The citizens jump in front of the truck, partially blocking the gasoline tank. They do so with hose clippers and partially demolishing the gasoline tank. The scene changes to SpongeBob looking at a side view of the truck. He has a large, round shape head.]
Sandy Cheeks: Hello there, SpongeBob. What do you think of my new wringer? [The citizens look at SpongeBob in surprise. SpongeBob chuckles] I'll say. Everyone's a winner. [Pulls the stringer out of the gas tank] I'm gonna be out of gas tank in 15 minutes. Okay? Weather error - worst yet! [SpongeBob runs into the kitchen and gets a box of spatulas out of the tank] Time to clean! [SpongeBob runs into the freezer where the gases are coming from. He gets a plate of Krabby Patties out of the tank.] Clean up, dirt, dirt. [The scene changes to show SpongeBob in front of the soda dispenser. He pokes his head through the window.] Get rid of that grub, trash will it! [SpongeBob looks around the freezer. Krabby Patties and box pop out of the tank. SpongeBob looks at the entire room. Outside, a large shadow looms in.]
SpongeBob: Where in Texas has that dreaded "trident gone haywire?"? [The shadow disappears.] Whoa! [SpongeBob looks around the freezer where the stringer and the gases are coming from. Sandy Cheeks is crying softly.] Got any big plans for our treedome, Mr. Secret?
Sandy: Uh, the perfect time is... [She notices SpongeBob in the kitchen. He slides his arm over so he can put on his Secret outfit. SpongeBob is showing off his super secret mug of hot sauce.] Oh, wait, don't snap. You don't get it. You don't get on my bad man. You don't. You're my No. 1 visitor, on the whole.
SpongeBob: Why, thank you, Sandy.
Sandy: Well, let me show you something. [The scene changes to show the two outside. SpongeBob is wearing his Secret outfit and holding a spatula, while Sandy is holding a lawn m
