[Plankton is running, lifting weights, and doing push-ups and dips.]
Plankton: WheeOOOOOOOuuuuuuuuuuu!
SpongeBob: Ooooooom!
[SpongeBob continues to run, which makes Plankton jump up and down, acting as a speedometer.]
Plankton: Breaking records! Excuse me, may I myself have a glass of water?
SpongeBob: Oh, sure! I have a glass of water. [soap grabs his glass and carries him to the bathroom] I just can't quite get my balance right now.
[The glass of water hits his head and makes him scream. He walks over to a speedometer reading at a much higher speed]
Plankton: Oh, hey there, I think I can feel yourself getting faster. Uh-huh.
[At a boat mobile driving up to the speedometer with Plankton at the wheel.]
SpongeBob: Wow, I sure had my eye on my safe driving ways. [laughs as the speedometer spins around and hits the gas pedal, making it stop] Oh, excuse me. Sorry you're a little confused, SpongeBob.
[At closing time, the glass is still hitting the gas pedal and Plankton is still screaming. The speedometer data recorders go down about the factory and Plankton screams in frustration. The glass breaks and the speedometer stops on a gas pedal. The glass breaks on the gas pedal and Plankton screams in rage. He goes into a giant hole and his body a hole. The gas pedal goes down and Plankton screams. He gets himself tangled in the fast moving gas pedal and he ends up getting killed. He screams again and spits on the brake. The gas pedal sends him falling somewhere and Plankton gets tangled in the brake again. The two get themselves tangled in the brake again and get tangled in the brake levers and the brake levers and screamer and finally get caught in a tornado and eventually died. The gas pedal breaks on impact and sends Plankton crashing into a speedboat owned by Patrick. Patrick screams and spits on the windshield of the boat, causing it to break and crash into a speedboat owned by Sadie.]
Patrick: Oh, sorry. [his teeth say "ATHOLES" on the windshield] HelloooOOOOOLATHOLATHOLATHOL! [his body is now a wooden sculpture of SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hey, who got the Krusty Krab on my birthday?
Patrick: [SpongeBob's arm breaks off and falls on his birthday] Dad.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Aww. So, what are you doing today?
Patrick: I'm raking time a little bit. [SpongeBob tries to say something else that might have annoyed Patrick. He looks shocked.] Hey, SpongeBob, say something.
SpongeBob: [babbles, gets interrupted by clams sipping] Hey, there's one more thing I have to say.
Plankton: Hey, wait up, you'll find my speech a little dry. [writes an essay on paper and waves a cane] That's right, everybody. [writes some more on his phone and listens into his ear] That was a pretty good essay, huh, Karen?
Karen: Yeah, I thought you were trying to kill me.
Plankton: Oh, Karen, I'm no Karen. What am I going to do now?
Karen: I need you to feed me. [clings onto SpongeBob's rear inching out and Plankton is writing on his paper as he is hammering his way to the door]
Plankton: Come on, Karen. Do it! Do it! Do it!
Karen: Feed me?
Plankton: No, no. Come on. Come on. Come on. [grunts as he drives around in circles in his boat, smacking his way into a speedboat, then goes back to the Chum Bucket] That's enough! Using my new aerobics, I race and get revenge! [sees SpongeBob staring at him] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hi Plankton. Where are you?
Plankton: I'm down here. [points down a hill]
SpongeBob: Me? Hi Plankton, where are you?
Plankton: How long have you been spying on me?
SpongeBob: Oh, he was long gone. But today he sheds his skin, and all his stuff falls into the dump. [smells something in the dump and slithers back into his house] Hey he's mine.
Plankton: I knew it! You're not what you seemed like!
