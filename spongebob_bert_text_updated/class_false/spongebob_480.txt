<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office, humming the annual song while holding up a stack of phony invoices.]
Mr. Krabs: [singing] ♪Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties, love them! Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties, love them!♪ The Krusty Krab presents are now closed. Mr. Krabs is so engrossed in his own little orchestra-inet theater that he seems to forget that he's singing the annual song-n-n-n-n-ol song-s that he starts to sweat profusely.]
[Mr. Krabs becomes so hypnotized by the music he's floating in turns him body turns into a screen, a TV, and he comes out of his body in a giant patty. The patty appears on the screen and Mr. Krabs takes it out, literally. It snores and Mr. Krabs opens his eyes, bounces off of his body and lands on the grill on the grill. The patty bounces on his body and lands on the grill, sending wood and meat off of it and smudging on the meat on the grill. A square shaped Krabby Patty falls on top of the patty.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm. [sighs and fins up a little] Hmm. Huh? Ooh. Good thing I spent $15 on a grill full of meat. [laughs and hisses]
[The scene changes to the dining room. Five customers are standing in the front room and Mr. Krabs is there in his office chair. A loud roar is heard and a lot of meat and wood are coming out of the outside door.]
Mr. Krabs: [singing] ♪Party on, Krabby!♪ Welcome customers, we're closing the Krusty Krab for good. Come back next week for another slice of Krabbie! [music is heard whistling and then a lot of customers look at it]
[music is heard whistling and then a lot of customers look at it] House order! We haven't had a customer in weeks! We can't keep up with all of your party needs, don't you understand?
Fred: I've been here for three days and am still in need of a patty!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, here's your Krabby Patty. [hands Mr. Krabs the patty]
Mr. Krabs: [sarcastically as SpongeBob grabs it] What? It's not in me hand! [Mr. Krabs shrieks and runs around] Wait, SpongeBob, don't leave me here! [SpongeBob runs away] Wait, don't leave me here! [SpongeBob runs screaming and hitting his head on a table] Stop! Mr. Krabs! [SpongeBob jumps on the bed and lies there with the patty still in his hands] Hey, that's better. I didn't get the memo. [walks over to the table with the patty] You've been a busy, busy place all along, haven't you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I've been a busy place, always have. [shows a calendar] Let me just say up front, we didn't want everyone to be served early or anything. We wanted everyone to have a break from their busy lives.
Mr. Krabs: Early?
SpongeBob: Yes, that's right.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you don't have to be busy all day to be busy, do you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: No, I suppose you don't have to be shivering in order to find out. That's what I was saying. [sniffles]
Mr. Krabs: Well, then I guess I have to give you the morning off.
SpongeBob: That's right.
Mr. Krabs: Well, take it easy you don't mind. [walks over to a chalkboard] We've decided which of you two will win this morning's competition and which will you stay in the corner and keep running around?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we'll have to choose who gets the first crack at the competition. [Mr. Krabs starts to sweat] I'm getting tired.
[later, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are standing in front of a chalkboard]
Mr. Krabs: What's this for?
SpongeBob: I'm trying to learn some French.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, okay. Have fun!
[clink. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs sitting in a room together in the dining room]
Mr. Krabs: Now if you'll excuse me, French
