SpongeBob: Ooh, Squidward, did you hear something?
Squidward: [sighs] Yes. A strange green thing slowly moves in front of my nose. [The green thing appears on the screen and moves in front of my nose. It has nose hair.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [walks up] Squidward!
Squidward: [Looks at SpongeBob and Patrick] What's that?
Patrick: It's Squidward's nose.
SpongeBob: Whatâ€™s with the dirty laundry, mister?
Squidward: Those two must be spending a great deal of time away from me.
Patrick: One, two, three, four. Don't you find that overwhelming?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: I know we found it!
[Patrick and SpongeBob walk back to Squidward]
Squidward: You are it! All right, where are you going, where are you going?
SpongeBob: Where are you going, Squidward?
Squidward: That's it! That's it! I'm going to get me a new roof rack!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
Squidward: Whoo-hoo! [both go out of the tree and made to have roof rack]
SpongeBob: See you later, Patrick.
Patrick: Whoo-hoo-hoo.
Squidward: Oh, I'll come back later. [laughs]
[SpongeBob and Patrick arrive at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: It's almost time for the evening break. [they pile into Squidward's car] Let's see what's inside. [it's foggy] Oh, yeah. [car drives off. They sigh] Well, it's a real sting. [laughs] The smells are unbearable. [sighs] Oh, the irony is the least I can do is laugh. [laughs] [looks through the window and seesfrog waving his green light] The smell of ketchup is unbearable. [kicks Krusty Krab's sign] Whoo-hoo-hoo! [turns the light on] Oh, that's where I like ketchup better. [keeps looking around, only getting a single truck coming towards him] I guess that makes me a weakling. [touches some poles] Oh, I bet there's a truck just waiting for me. [touches poles yet another time machine] Oh, there is one. [gets stopped by the truck with the light on. The truck explodes and smokes Squidward out. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where Squidward is still going around when the truck blows big red 'O' signs]
Mr. Krabs: You'll never catch me, this slow sucker! [cries] I bet I can't catch you either.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I've got Squidward now!
Mr. Krabs: [takes the sign and runs off screen. SpongeBob and Patrick come back together and congratulate each other.] A real fisherman knows the drill.
[Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where Squidward is flipping patties. SpongeBob and Patrick go over to him and does the same. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs at the door]
Mr. Krabs: Make a wish, and you'll be alright. I hope you're alright.
SpongeBob: Oh, good. I can't take that kind of pressure.
Mr. Krabs: All right, you'll lift the trophy, fast. Give me a spin. [pours the patties into SpongeBob's mouth and they hit Patrick on the head of his boat]
Patrick: Ouch!
Mr. Krabs: Patrick, what's this about vehicle that you're driving?
Patrick: It's my vehicle. [points to his behind]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Stupid kid. Slow down there, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: So, uh, where'd you go?
Mr. Krabs: Uh...I built it myself, right?
SpongeBob: Uh, yeah. My house.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what are you doing?
Patrick: Uhh, I built it myself.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what do you want me to do?
Patrick: I built it myself.
Mr. Krabs: That's what you do when you're not doing your job.
Patrick: Yeah. And it wasn't until this truck hit the bottom of the ocean that I realized what I was doing.
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing, buddy?
Patrick: I'm doing what I
