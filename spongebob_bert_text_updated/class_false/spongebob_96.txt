SpongeBob: This is it, buddy! This is the next big thing. This is the SpongeBob SquarePants fanciest episode ever! And here comes the kids the most requested one, so get your tickets early! [everyone crowds around SpongeBob] Let's go, SpongeBob! [to the audience] You don't know who to go with this crowd, do you?
Pirate: Who?
SpongeBob: Allies?
Pirate: No.
SpongeBob: [to the audience] Pirates, come on, everyone's waiting for an opening!
Pirate: [laughs] Coming on, right?
SpongeBob: Why, it's the most talked about show in the sea-oh! A show that's going to wow people, and bring in a billion bucks!
Pirate: Why, it's not just any ordinary sponge! [shows a realistic version of SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Rawr!
Pirate: Oh, this isn't going to be good.
SpongeBob: It's not just this, it's what's fixin' it?
Pirate: What's crackin' a boat, then, do people want a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Rawr! [shows the Krabby Patty again, the audience gasps] Rawr! [shows a real Krabby Patty now made out of wood, glued in place, with a flag that says "Closed Offendings" and a sign that says "I Don't Want Yours"] Closed off-er! [SpongeBob does and he and Patrick laugh]
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you ready?
SpongeBob: Between the ages of 15 and 49, come on, everyone! [They all begin to giggle, Squidward growls and victory is his, then the doors close, SpongeBob turns around, with SpongeBob's face on the screen, cheering] Squidward, the Krusty Krab is yours truly! [SpongeBob and Patrick's heads are painted a banner that says "Open Enclose" with SpongeBob's and Patrick's heads on the screens, then Squidward's closed off-screen. The doors close again. SpongeBob, SpongeBob, Patrick, some fish, some hanging on before the doors close again. Some fish] Closing time! [SpongeBob then notices that the doors are closed, SpongeBob walks to Patrick] Patrick, this is going to be really good.
Patrick: Good? The show's over now! [SpongeBob opens the doors] We don't even have time to get drenched yet.
SpongeBob: It's over already, Patrick. [walks to the front of the stage and starts to read the introductions]
Narrator: One minute thirty seven seconds later... [SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting down reading the introductions]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. How's "The Sponge Who Could Fly" been?
Patrick: Totally convincing. What is it?
SpongeBob: Well, I was a little nervous, Patrick. That songwriting genius... [Patrick sings] ♪The Sponge Who Could Fly...♪ [SpongeBob thumbs it off] Hey, Patrick. How's "The Sponge Who Could Dance" been?
Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob, I wrote that song myself. [SpongeBob screams and runs away Narrator: 72 hours later...
Patrick: Let's go back to the Krusty Krab. [SpongeBob and Patrick are still screaming, walking to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: I'm going, Patrick. [takes Patrick's hat off and has it covered his hat] Patrick, you don't look good doing these things at the Krusty Krab. This could be my ticket to the dancefloors.
Patrick: I don't have time for that! [takes hat off] Time to play the flute board game. [SpongeBob and Patrick are playing the flute board game, SpongeBob smells SpongeBob's tongue and it burns his hat off] I've gotta take a shower, get my hair ready, then I'm going to the bathroom to get ready for work.
SpongeBob: Maybe just the shower. [takes shower, SpongeBob looks in the mirror and finds that his hair is still burnt, Patrick comes out] Hair! I was going to iron out that few more minutes. [SpongeBob screams, Patrick takes a hair swab and smells SpongeBob's tongue] I've gotta take a shower, get my hair ready, then I'm going to the bathroom to get ready for work. [SpongeBob sighs in relief] I've gotta get ready for work. [cuts to later where both of your houses are shaking]
