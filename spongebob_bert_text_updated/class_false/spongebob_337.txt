[The episode begins with Gary snoring and meowing]
SpongeBob: [to Gary] Come on, Gary, let's go watch some TV. [leaves]
[Gary starts to cry and SpongeBob stops him]
SpongeBob: Gary! [to Gary] Oh, you're crying so hard, you're crying with your eyes closed. Look at how my plants turned on. [tears start to form from his eyes and down to his skin] It's true. [tears start to appear on his leaves] It's true. [tears start to appear on his eyebrows] It's true. [tears start to appear on his nose] It's all true.
[Gary's throat is cut and he falls silent. Then a noise is heard and it sounds as if SpongeBob has been killed in the head.]
SpongeBob: Gary, are you saying it's me, me, you or...? [shows Gary the newspaper] Or are you a ghost?
[Gary's left arm is chopped off]
SpongeBob: [ties Gary with a chain around his neck] Come on, Gary, we've got a new reporter on the way.
[Gary is completely beaten up.]
SpongeBob: We're not ghosts, we're the cops!
[Gary meows angrily and SpongeBob hits his head on the window.]
Officer John: We've got a body.
[Officer John meows again and says, "Body?"]
Patrick: [oblivious to the police notices] What's a body?
Police Officer: It's a deceiver that you have.
[Patrick points to a newspaper that says HE WILL NEVER JAIL YOU. Officer John sees this and he meows. SpongeBob is literally begging the police to let him go, so he comes out as a reformed criminal who is less likely to get hurt. He meows a bit more and Sherlock Holmes meows a bit more. He's telling the truth about himself.]
SpongeBob: I thought he said that.
[SpongeBob runs off and comes back with the most ridiculous case of The Flying Dossier.]
SpongeBob: (sarcastically) Yes, I know. I'll confess! I'll confess and I'll do it again! Come on, let's go see the judge.
[SpongeBob runs off and comes back with a murder case that says HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,I WON'T wanna be stuck it!
Patrick: You'll never know! You can confess!
SpongeBob: I'll confess!
Patrick: I'll confess!
[SpongeBob runs off and comes back with a charred remains of an old stuffing factory.]
SpongeBob: [yawns] I confess to burning down the old stuffing factory!
Patrick: Are you going to confess?!
SpongeBob: I Will confess!!
Patrick: Oh, this is so hard!
SpongeBob: I won't let the law take your life!
Patrick: Okay! [shakes his head 'no contest]'
SpongeBob: I won't,'
Patrick: Aliens from outer space!
SpongeBob: [his hand breaks] Alright! Let's face it, Patrick, our solar system home is the dump! [forms a rectangle around the solar system with his face and right hand] Go somewhere else! I'll get you a good driver's license!
[SpongeBob goes to the dump, but Patrick knocks it over with his foot.]
Patrick: Ooh, ooh, a Krusty Krab drive with extra nails!
[SpongeBob goes to drive, but trips and falls on his back. He rubs Patrick's butt and it sticks. SpongeBob comes back and rubs Patrick's butt again and it sticks. He comes back several times and it doesn't stick. He comes back several more times and it doesn't stick. SpongeBob comes back several more times, but it doesn't stick. He comes home a few more times and it doesn't stick. ]
Officer Rob: Well, that's enough. You're under arrest.
[Later]
Officer John: Well, that was quite a storm at the dump, boys.
SpongeBob: What's wrong, Patrick?
Patrick: Aliens.
SpongeBob: [comes back several times] I can't believe they're here! [he comes up to Patrick and touches him]
Officer Rob: Well, what do you think you're doing?
Officer John: Uh... You're out of detention. Boy, you're gonna have to do it again.
SpongeBob: Really?
Officer Rob: Yep. You
