SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward.
Squidward: [narrating] Was it really mine, then?
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: Then listen, SpongeBob. I'm sorry I called you a moron.
SpongeBob: Why?
Squidward: Because you called me a moron.
SpongeBob: So, I gonna go apologize.
Squidward: [snores] What? Really?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward. Because I didn't think you should be called a moron.
Squidward: What? [giggles] No. No, no, no, no. Really.
SpongeBob: Really? [goes to the kitchen] Hey, Squidward, you need some help measuring and cooking me money?
Squidward: I didn't need any help, I got all this money all by myself.
SpongeBob: So, what are some of the things you need to do to make that money?
Squidward: Well, first of all, I build the Krabby Patties myself. [SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Ooh, roast the beef.
Squidward: Oh, no, no, no, that's too hot. I also, I, I don't need this expensive equipment. [grabs the oven-baked patties are out of the oven]
SpongeBob: But what about the Krabby Fries? [pulls out his spatula] That's not what I wanted.
Squidward: That? What about those? What's the matter?
SpongeBob: I didn't want to build them up over and over, you see, so that you could take home the formula all over again. [SpongeBob builds a huge army of Krabby Fries]
Squidward: I forgot the budget.
SpongeBob: I'm going to start budgeting now.
Squidward: I didn't have any money in my budget. Could you help me?
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward? Allow me to demonstrate. [SpongeBob runs off]

SpongeBob: This is going to taste so good, Squidward. [runs off]
Squidward: Wait, SpongeBob! [turns around and his arms fall on his body] I want this extra patties. Plus, I'm a... [SpongeBob makes more patties] ...a...

All of a sudden, the Krabby Patties come in with a sold out. second pattie: Oh, Squidward, don't we know how lucky we are?
Squidward: We do? Well, why not? [bangs head into the patty] You still here?
SpongeBob: I still be here tonight? [starts to cry]
Squidward: Then do yourself and the Krusty Krab a favor and stop feeding those who serve food to those who serve it. [SpongeBob suddenly stops breathing and wipes away a tear fall from his mouth] You know what I think of you. I know what I'm doing.
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: What's wrong, Squidward?
Squidward: I don't know. What do you two mean?
SpongeBob: I mean, "You" mean we shouldn't feed those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who serve food to those who
