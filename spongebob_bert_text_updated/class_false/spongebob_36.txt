SpongeBob: [turns off the alarm and chuckles as he closes his eyes; the alarm goes off again] Whoo! High pitched! [SpongeBob's left arm tries to bend his left arm, but it breaks and sends him flying over there, and off balance again] Oh! Success! [SpongeBob falls over, his arm falls on his desk and falls on the fire hydrant] Oh, Mr. Krabs! Your arm! [SpongeBob grabs Krabby Patties] I'll make it up to you, Mr. Krabs. Serve my friends 'em while they eat them. 
Mr. Krabs: [grabs out a can of pepperoni] That'll be five dollars to the little guy.
SpongeBob: I'll buy the house a place to live. Those patties would be extra extra thanks to you.
Mr. Krabs: [throws away the patties] Thanks, boyo. 
[The scene changes to Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is selling the kitchen for 25 dollars to the little guy. The little guy walks in.]
Little Guy 1: [knocks on door] Hi. How do you like my—
Mr. Krabs: [stops him] What's he doing?
SpongeBob: [stops him] Oh, he's been here for years.
Mr. Krabs: He must've been the victim of a bargain.
SpongeBob:…. [laughs] Bargain? But I don't like the little guy.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, you won't sell anything but your house for 25 dollars.
[The little guy walks over to the house and gives Mr. Krabs a 25 dollar bill]
Little Guy 2: Thanks.
Mr. Krabs: Well, if he doesn't like it, he's not doing anything.
Little Guy 1: Thanks.
Mr. Krabs: ‘Cause I'm a bit of a prune blossom without all the stinky chus. [leaves]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob walking down the street.]
SpongeBob: Isn't that the sign?
Frank: [walks up to SpongeBob] Don't you think it's outdated? [shows a modern sign]
SpongeBob: I've been using this old sign as a whipping up inspiration. [scoffs and runs into the Krusty Krab] Whoa!
[Frank goes into the Krusty Krab. Frank is wearing a chicken wing that says 'FREE BURIED!']
Frank: I'd like to order a Krabby Patty.
[SpongeBob looks around for the order and realized that he only found one left.]
SpongeBob: No, no, that's not it. I'll ask my friend Squidward. He'll have the recipe.
Squidward: [shrugs his shoulders] SpongeBob, I'm not taking orders here. Just give me the menu and I'll add it to the kitchen bulletin board. [SpongeBob looks at the menu again and realizes that he made an error] SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, I have a confession to make.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Just make it quick and keep it for later.
SpongeBob: Thar she blows. [tries to open the kitchen door, but couldn't] No. [later, SpongeBob is eating a Krabby Patty] Hmm, was that the best thing about all? Well, not that best, really. What is it?
Squidward: Well, what is it?
SpongeBob: No, no, bad. bad.
Squidward: Good. Now just let me introduce you to my grand-son, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: ♪Grandma SpongeBob♪ [acorn bell rings]
Squidward: SpongeBob is amazing.
SpongeBob: I'll have to remember that. [runs into the kitchen]
Squidward: SpongeBob is amazing.
SpongeBob: Oh SpongeBob, you're the best looking father I've ever had.
Squidward: Well, I don't know SpongeBob, you're the best looking mother you've ever had.
SpongeBob: Well, okay if that's semi-scientific. [leans towards triangle] Well done, Squidward. You're the best looking brother you've ever known.
Squidward: Well, how is that going to help you?
SpongeBob: Well, okay, I've talked to Squidward about this, and he's absolutely positively glowing.
Squidward: glowing?
SpongeBob: I can't write this.
Squidward: Well, okay, one more time.
Sponge
