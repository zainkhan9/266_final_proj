<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Patrick are getting ready for bed. SpongeBob touches his watch with his finger.]
SpongeBob: Good work, I'd like to wake up already. [leaves]
SpongeBob: [whistles musically] Aw, I'll be back, Patrick. 
Patrick: [whispers to SpongeBob] See you later. 
[Cut to the Chum Bucket, Plankton is sitting on the toilet pushing some of the trash out.]
Plankton: Ah, it's time to feed Gary. 
[Fred comes out of the sink with Gary, Plankton walks up to him.]
Fred: My diet plan is literally a dump? 
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is the best one yet. 
Plankton: [laughs] Gary the Notary is here.
Gary: Meow. 
[Suddenly, the Notary Comes carries the trash out and throws it on the floor. Plankton takes the trash away and starts to cry. The trash comes back with the dumpster door open and all of the trash is inside. Fred comes out of the dumpster.]
Fred: Meow. 
[Fred goes inside his house with the dumpster door closed. Fred goes inside his house, hears a squelching noise, the trash starts to move and squelching sounds are heard being thrown in his mouth. Fred gets squished.]
Plankton: Grrrrr... [his body is squished] Oh, my gosh! 
Karen: Your body is squished, too! [cries in her house until her light bulb shatters] 
Plankton: [comes back out with a bigger bulb then left] Hooray! [picks up his new body] Now, what could be better than to work up a supercharged fury?! 
Karen: That's just the bulbs. Here, you'll see. [lights turn on. scene cuts to Mr. Krabs and Plankton's normal looks]
Plankton: Here you go, Krabs. [throws a bunch of trinkets at Mr. Krabs and Plankton, who retaliates with a pair of booty bars around his neck. Scene cuts to Plankton jumping on Mr. Krabs' back while Blubberberry is sitting on top of his chair]
Plankton: Here you go, Krabs. [Krabs jumps on Plankton] In the mornings, I run techno-maniac-maniac by comparison. 
Mr. Krabs: And then I'm gonna kick your butt! [laughs]
Plankton: And then! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] I'm not.
Plankton: Nope. [lifts his chair up with legurings] I'm grungy maniac-maniac-iac-om-fool! [he runs off] Now that's what I'm talking about!
Karen: And then I was wondering about your new job, too!
Plankton: Now, why don't you take the oath of office?
[Mr. Krabs takes Plankton's oath.]
Karen: Are you a politician, or a rock star?
Plankton: [thinks for a second] Uh, I'm a rock star, yeah. [puts down his cup. Scene cuts to the three of them in front of a piano, marching]
Plankton: Uh, Karen!
Karen: Well, it's supposed to be about your booty, Plankton. [thinks for a second] Well, at stake! [Screams]
Plankton: [writes on the clipboard] Assertiveness. Now get to your stations. [presses red button] Assert!
[Plankton gets the booty from behind a red background]
Mr. Krabs: [lying] Yes!
Plankton: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, what the?
Plankton: Your booty was all mine, Krabs. And I've got a little here to... [stammers] ...take. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: A-ha, I'm not cheap. I'm just so... [thinks] This is hot!
Plankton: Wait, don't be worked up. I'm getting here!
Mr. Krabs: Right, Plankton?
Plankton: Wait, don't go! [lifts a wall] I'm your REAL boss! [jumps on it and it reflects Plankton on it. Scene cuts to the outside of SpongeBob's pineapple, where he is working]
