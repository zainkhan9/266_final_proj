[The episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick going to get water for their play date.]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪So long and so glad... and happy and happy. I'm stuck with you guys. So long I'm stuck with you all. So long I wanna make sure you all kiss the tip of my dick. So long, I'm gonna cum on your sweater. So long, I'm gonna dig you into the depths of your you poop! So long! So long! I wish we had something to eat later. I know we don't wanna disappoint our carnivorous friends, but do you know what this deck has to offer us? We don't have to overcome all the rocks in the deck. Hey, Patrick, that's not coral! We have power tools! To get the sharp edges... find... erosion... drill...
Patrick: The deck!
SpongeBob: The deck!
Patrick: The deck!
[Patrick rips it and SpongeBob swings over to an erosion machine.]
SpongeBob: The deck... this! [ [shows deck] Where are we?
Patrick: [points deck] To the end of the pier.
SpongeBob: The end of the pier.
Patrick: Where are we?
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk through the erosion machine. Patrick is dying, but uses up the deck. Patrick runs through the machine again, but this time he uses up the deck. SpongeBob is also using up the deck and Patrick is dying too—hears from the back of the machine): "And they said...they're taking us to the end of the pier!"
Patrick: No! Not the end of the pier!
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run to the end of the pier. The machine starts extracting the alien metal again.]
Patrick: We're gonna get it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:,squeaky...
[As Patrick was snoring, Nat Peterson's house shrinks and dies.]
Patrick: Ohh... that's too little... [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wait! We've got enough power!
[SpongeBob and Patrick use a wooden boat as they break out of the machine.]
SpongeBob: Ohh... we broke it...
Patrick: We broke it! [grunts]
SpongeBob: The batteries...
Patrick: We broke it! [grunts]
[SpongeBob and Patrick charge from their respective pits. Patrick pulls Patrick and SpongeBob's faces together while Patrick cries. The boat regenerates and powers up.]
SpongeBob: We're ready!
[SpongeBob blasts open the front door and all of the cement behind him. He opens the top floor, shoving the bags of cement into the windows. He steps on a worm's mouth full of water. He then gets in a dazed state.]
Patrick: Yay! [gets in a karate chop with SpongeBob] 
[SpongeBob grabs Patrick and pinches his head with his toe]
SpongeBob: You're ready...
[SpongeBob pinches his toe too much, causing it to splatter through the wall. Patrick is shocked and he gets really angry. He pushes SpongeBob aside and instead of beating SpongeBob, he chops SpongeBob's head whole. He then lifts SpongeBob up and puts him in a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: You're ready...
Patrick: [whacks his head with his claw] My little trick.
[SpongeBob's eyes bug out and he hallucinates.]
Patrick: My little trick! 
[Patrick and SpongeBob dance to the music]
Patrick and SpongeBob: Behold that monstrous, hideous demon!
[SpongeBob is sure to catch the SpongeBob and Patrick are demons and they all dance to the music]
SpongeBob: That's me, ghostliness! [comes out to reveal to be Patrick's bellybutton then back to it's original spot] Oh, oh my! Ghostiness! That's Patrick's ghostliness! [eyes turn to Patrick horror] 
Patrick: Oh, oh, oh! [Patrick runs into the machine and gets up quickly to the door] I can't keep up this trick, Patrick! Every time I tap the wrong button, he shrinks! [shows the wrong button] So, how do I turn Patrick into... [shows the wrong button] Squidward... [Squidward shrieks and goes back to his house] Squidward! [all the machines quiet as a door opens. Patrick falls down to the floor and starts to attack him, he then screams and runs around, he then runs through the wall, he then gets sprayed with Squidward's slime. He then grows and shrinks really fast] Turnin' all that barnacle man! [Patrick starts
