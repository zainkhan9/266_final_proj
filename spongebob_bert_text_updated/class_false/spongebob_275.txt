[The episode begins with Gary making a puppet version of his Uncle Tim's Voice.]
Uncle Tim: â™ªThe money is coming in, Timmy, 'cause my Uncle Tim's voice is so sweet. How'd I miss your funeral of yours? How'd you miss my Mom's funeral? Oh, you'd...uh, you know, you're just a voice...uh, I don't get it. You're a ghost. [Uncle Tim starts to cry and groans loudly]
Gary: Meow.
Timmy: Hey, hey, hey. Come on, Gary. Let's get out of here before somebody does.
Patchy: But... the ghost of my Uncle Tim.
Gary: Meow.
Patchy: My Uncle Tim's ghost? [unhas his arms and legs split and he runs around and around] Para-da-dee-dum-dee-dum, Para-da-dum-dum-dee-dum. Come on. Go away. Don't come back. Ti-ti-ti... [continues to run around and around until he finally stops] Para-da-dum-da-dum. All right, who needs him? [notices anyone] Friend or foe, I am Freddy Krab and this is no accident. [SpongeBob and Patrick come up from their picnic]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Ghost.
Patrick: Or maybe he's Timmy.
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, Timmy. Is that you?
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: Hello, Patrick. I am Timmy.
Patrick: Timmy? Timmy's ghost? [screams] Ghost... [makes scary face] ...Timmy's ghost. [runs away crying]
Timmy: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! [Patrick runs over] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! [runs over to Harold and Margaret's coffin] Hey, Gary, you're supposed to be supporting me. [SpongeBob is behind Gary]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Well, here goes... support. [pokes the coffin but the rock spins around and sends him flying into a puppet of Margaret] Harold's ghost! [Harv had galloped away and SpongeBob gets up] Patti-tastic! [pokes Patti-time and then the Patti-time again] Ghost on the roadside! Ghost on the roadside! Ghost on the roadside! On the roadside! [pushes the button and the patties fly everywhere] Whoa-boaa! [trips over SpongeBob] Whoa-boaa-boaa! [driving through the crowd] Ah, drive! Ah, drive!
[The patties get on the track and SpongeBob tries to keep his cool, but the crowd boos as everyone else does.]
Harold: I can't do it!
Mable: I'm angry!
Sadie: Everybody's angry! [crashes into the wall by the wall and gets off by using her tail] Hmph!
Gus: I need a job!
[Gus gets off the wall and goes to get some exercise.]
Harold: Ooh, I do get my Jello back, but am I going to get it done as this fast?
[The patties take the exercise and dump it on the ground. SpongeBob comes back with his own workout.]
SpongeBob: [playfully] Good Morning, Grandma!
Grandma SquarePants: Morning, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, Grandma!
[SpongeBob runs and jumps in the air.]
Grandma SquarePants: How do you like it today?
[SpongeBob rest his body on the patty and it pants.]
SpongeBob: I'm so feeling up! [runs into the kitchen and takes a bite out of the patty] This is why we sell so many new condiments.
Grandma SquarePants: We as stinky as tartar sauce.
[SpongeBob takes another bite and screams. The patty goes on the grill and SpongeBob sticks out his tongue and it becomes transparent. SpongeBob walks back to his table.]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Grandma. I ought to call my client, [takes a bite of the patty] and let him know how much he likes my new outfit. I know just what to do.
Grandma SquarePants: [gasps] SpongeBob! Did you call your client, Mr. SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'll do anything you say. Anything you want! Some jazz! Some jazz! Gee, I
