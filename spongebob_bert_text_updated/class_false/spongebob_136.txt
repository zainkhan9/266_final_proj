[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is trying to decide which one of SpongeBob's cookies to pick.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, I really thought it over. [the cookie falls on his hand] Ahh... [the other cookies then fall on SpongeBob] That was more like it. I've decided on this one. [his choice of cookie] Cookies with too many small ingredients. [the amount of cookie falls on SpongeBob] SpongeBob. [laughs]
[SpongeBob picks up the burnt cookie, then he puts his finger in his mouth, and sniffs it.]
SpongeBob: Ooh. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you have to pick the one that's left open.
SpongeBob: I never open anything.
Mr. Krabs: Open anything? [ SpongeBob clings onto the grill, and his spatula goes out of reach gear] Oh, oh, I have to pick the open one.
SpongeBob: [ starts crying ] I don't want to have toâ€” [ Mr. Krabs grabs him and pulls him through the window, setting the spatula free.] There, boy! Serve!
Mr. Krabs: What serve? [ begins to feel angry ] The tables have turned! [ the table has turned! SpongeBob is deeply angry at Mr. Krabs for what he thinks are his reasons for running the Krusty Krab! He launches into the kitchen, where SpongeBob is about to get a drink.] Tell him to get back to the kitchen! Get that disgusting food out of my restaurant, or else.
SpongeBob: Fine, fine! [ the former is the former] To the Krusty Krab, I'm your friend, and to the Krusty Krab, I'm your friend? [ SpongeBob now wears a hat over his head that says, "I Love You a lot," and has a mustache; he starts to cry; Patrick puts a leash in his mouth and looks angry; Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob and puts him in a cage, which closes] Disposable, eh? [ begins to cry. He grabs a grinder and a saw, which slam on the floor] The Krusty Krab is stuck in a food-trapping device! [ screams after crying for three whole minutes. He screams after he walks past Patrick's rock, then into the freezer, where it is completely covered with a cheesecloth, and into the bucket with the other frozen Krabby Patties; he drops the bucket of frozen Krabby Patties on the floor] I've had enough! [ begins to cry again. He walks to the table, where Mr. Krabs takes off his hat] SpongeBob! [ begins to cry again] Responsible for this! [ he runs over to the hot grill, where he takes a large metal spatula and smashes it on the grill; he walks over to the table with the other frozen Krabby Patties, where he uses the metal spatula to smash the chairs with the meat; he even got his own spatula for this. He walks over to the table with the other frozen Krabby Patties, where he starts to take a deep breath and then starts eating them] Flibbertyl Blaster: [ starts to eat the Krabby Patty formula ] Hmm, I guess I should call this a nap. [ he takes off his hat, which has a label on it] Responsible for this! [ he starts to leave; he makes a strange noise] Or this. [ he starts to leave, carrying a slingshot with the formula on it] Or this. [ he starts to lunge at the Krabby Patties, who drive up with a huge army of hobo patties on their backs] Or this. [ he lunges towards the Krabby Patties, who drive up with a jellyfish hive in hand ] Or this. [ he lunges towards the Krabby Patties with his feet, which Gary then dumps into the patties. On the right is the formula, with a funnel at the back of the patties, who are now thinking. They are thinking about who Patrick is.] Delightful... [ the patties start to eat the formula, which incinerates SpongeBob. Patrick begins to lose his mind] ...come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey, lobster. What were you doing sitting in that dark kitchen?
SpongeBob: Delightful.
Patrick: [ starts to talk again] Uh, what?
SpongeBob: [ starts to talk again] Uh, what?
Patrick: Uh, you're not sitting in that dark kitchen!
SpongeBob: Come on, let's go!
Patrick: [ starts to walk off] Don't bother, SpongeBob! I'm not in
