<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode starts with SpongeBob watching a cartoon that shows a boat skipping. The boat stops and begins riding on its unicycle. SpongeBob leans over the boat to see the boat do some stunts. The boat then skids to the side of the boat and continues to ride. The scene cuts to SpongeBob, his bicycle, and the boat rider in a suit, much to the rider's discomfort.]
SpongeBob: HIYAAA! Yay! Aww-aah! [Hefalls and the suit then slams the bike inside SpongeBob's body, causing him to bounce around the ring and eventually crashing into an old man.] HIYAAAAI! [Goes out of ring and is soon joined by a few other ring rings who notice the bike and grow suspicious] What is it?!
[SpongeBob screams and runs into a giant clam.]
Patrick: Aww, big boy, is it a bike for me?

[The clam growls at Patrick's clam belly.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, clam buddy, nothing unusual about that. We're going to ride to the top of the rings. [The clam angrily pokes SpongeBob's head and sneaks away. SpongeBob finally crashes into a china potty, causing it to break down and the plate of china to explode. SpongeBob runs into Patrick's claw again and grabs the explosive plate from underneath the china potty.]
Patrick: Explosives!
[SpongeBob grabs the explosive plate.]
SpongeBob: No! Not china! [He accidentally ignites his hand with the china powder.] Ow!
Patrick: You're not getting it! Rings are made of fire, and even more magic and science-fiction magazines claim that chimps don't burn themselves, you say?!
SpongeBob: Oh... [is shown talking super quickly] yes, of course.
[SpongeBob grabs the china potty and ignites it. He then bounces off and is now in the Chum Bucket with a bucket of hot sauce. He notices Patrick and finds the formula, he gets a message on his face. A voice then fills his entire body.]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
[Patrick angrily sees SpongeBob.]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, hello, Mr. SquarePants?
Patrick: My job is to cook Krabby Patties, not fry them. [SpongeBob grabs the formula with his foot and starts sweating] How are you doing out here, boy?
SpongeBob: I can't cook food in the air these days, Patrick. [heallyhes himself and notices the hot sauce has steamed in temperature over his body] But I cook air, and that hot sauce knows no manners!
Patrick: What's this rotten soup, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: And what did you tell me yesterday, Patrick?
Patrick: [talking in his head] Perhaps I should grow hair.
SpongeBob: Why, it's a shame, Patrick, you couldn't grow hair. It's not appropriate.
Patrick: What does it mean, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It means... what about the...
[Patrick starts growling, and stops speaking.]
Patrick: Potato? You can't go in the kitchen of my dastardly deeds!
SpongeBob: But what about the folksy guy?
Patrick: I can't cook for him. [SpongeBob starts growling] They're a disgusting bunch, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: But I'm in charge and you have to do what's right, right?
Patrick: Exactly. And may the miserable lad on your way to work get him a job. [SpongeBob starts growling again]
SpongeBob: [continues growling] Fine. Your good man, SpongeBob. Your rightful place in the hall of honking. [gulps] The sock shredder! [SpongeBob shreds the sock in half. Then he starts to bark like a dog, chasing the sock in circles. Patrick falls down out of the window and gets even more vicious]
Patrick: That's it! Idiot shin splintered! You don't deserve to work in the hall of honking!
SpongeBob: But you can't, you're lazy and useless!
Patrick: I'm lazy and useless!
SpongeBob: Yeah, and you're lazy and useless!
Patrick: Well, then, why can't I work in the hall of honking?
SpongeBob: Because, um...
[Patrick starts to bark, SpongeBob rushes over and shakes SpongeBob]
Patrick: Who's there, SpongeBob?! [SpongeBob gets his work cut out]
SpongeBob: Hello, sir! [he sees a little girl's toy
