[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab where Squidward is doing his duty as janitor]
Mr. Krabs: Boy, hours have gone a long. I can already feel the customers' disgust. Hands down. [takes a deep breath, then blows a whistle]
Squidward: [whispering] Check.
[A line of fish moving by them by boat is created]
Mr. Krabs: Excuse me, sir, but you just stepped on one of these."
Squidward: What? Really?
Mr. Krabs: Just step on me now. [the line of fish leaves]
Mr. Krabs and the Fish: Hooray!
[Mr. Krabs takes a deep breath and continues walking]
Squidward: That's right. Step on that register. [notices a hendorate is missing] Uh-oh, it has the "Missing" sign on it.
Mr. Krabs: You, sir?
Squidward: He's not missing! [starts walking away, then Mr. Krabs walks over to him] He's missing me money!
Mr. Krabs: You mean the cash register?
Squidward: Probably not. [shakes his head, then continues walking]
Mr. Krabs: That's it. I'm going to get rid of all my money and move to a place that's closer to me- [walks into the elevator] -Myah!
[Bubble leapfrogs Squidward to the top of the elevator. He then slides it up to the surface. He falls and cheersfully hugs it. He then proceeds to do push-ups for the rest of the way, but they reduced to a single squiggly squiggly squiggle. He then begins to move down the elevator, which sends him sliding all over the place where his weight falls and hitting the ceiling. He briefly climbs back up, but he ends up falling five times hitting the ceiling. He then resumes doing push-ups from the bottom of the elevator, but he ends up falling six times hitting the ceiling. He climbs back down, but he ends up falling seven times hitting the ceiling. He goes back up, but he ends up falling eight times hitting the ceiling. He goes back up, but he ends up falling nine times hitting the ceiling. He goes back up, but he ends up falling ten times hitting the ceiling. SpongeBob is about to go to sleep when he notices Squidward is gone]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, you're here? [sleepily walks out the Krusty Krab] Oh, Squidward, you're here? What are you doing? [nervously sweats] W-What are you doing? [walks to the Krusty Krab] I found you... [kicks the door] like a dog. [SpongeBob is sleeping and Mr. Krabs looks around] Well, what do you know? The Krusty Krab is no place for a Squidward fan! Join me, SpongeBob, and I'll bring fortune to you! [walks to fortune and falls] Well, good night, Mr. Krabs. [slides down the elevator] Quick, Squidward fan! Fortune gives us one more Squidward to Neptune! [leaves]
Mr. Krabs: Well, fortune favors me! Can I have it?
Squidward: Eh, no. [walks out the elevator] Quick, SpongeBob! Fortune gives us one more Squidward to Neptune! [lowers his hand] Well, fortune favors us! Can I have it?
Mr. Krabs: Eh, no. [lowers his hand] Uh, suck it. I can have anything I want. Anything! [Squidward sucks the hand] Anything! [SpongeBob sucks the hand] Anything!
SpongeBob: Well, Squidward, today's not the day. Today's the [uhh, I don't hear anything more.] [stressed] best day ever!
Squidward: How [uhh, he feels embarrassed, but he decides to focus on the matter at hand] is on the right.
Mr. Krabs: I see [uhh, he notices SpongeBob sleeping, and he notices this] but, uhh, SpongeBob, will you be quiet? [giggles] Quiet, eh, buddy?
SpongeBob: Easy... once you get inside...
Squidward: That's it! I will not allow this trash to go to sea!
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, Squidward?
Squidward: You can thank me. There is no one left to make the world's greatest restaurant.
Mr. Krabs: All right, Mr. Underwood, you're the one
