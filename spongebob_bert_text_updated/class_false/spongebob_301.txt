[Episode starts when SpongeBob and Patrick are chasing jellyfish]
SpongeBob: Huh? [as they go over a cliff] Go, Patrick, have jellyfishing been a joy?
Patrick: Go, SpongeBob, I wish I could be here collecting them.
SpongeBob: What if I were you?
Patrick: I'd like that, too. [as they chase each other over the cliff]
SpongeBob: What if I were you?
Patrick: I'd like that, too. [as they chase each other over the cliff again]
SpongeBob: What if I were me?!
Patrick: Go, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What if I were me?!
Patrick: I'd like that too! [both start bouncing with jelly and running, peeking out through the hole and hitting each other. They both bounce again]
SpongeBob: Whee! Faster, Patrick! [Patrick hits SpongeBob]
Patrick: I'm getting a taste of my jelly fix! [both start bouncing again and Patrick hits SpongeBob again, causing him to bounce even faster]
SpongeBob: Whee! More, Patrick! [Patrick hits SpongeBob even more more times before hitting his head]
Head: Nah. [SpongeBob notices that Mr. Krabs is bouncing] I could see that coming.
Patrick: What's happening to me? [Mr. Krabs' head tilts upside-down, and I lose my antennae] 
SpongeBob: I'm still in pain. [Mr. Krabs' head bounces off him and lands on his hand. It stops under his desk]
Mr. Krabs: So? How was your day?
SpongeBob: I'm a barnacle head. [Mr. Krabs' head spins on its back and lands on his nose] Uhh... I'll tell you how it was. [Mr. Krabs continues bouncing, but his antennae is gone]
Mr. Krabs: That's it? I'm done. Now, I want you to change the channel.
SpongeBob: But, but, but, but, Patrick...
Mr. Krabs: You didn't even get to change the channel! [both start bouncing insanely]
Crawley: Pow!
Prisoner #2: [chuckles] Good thing he went.
SpongeBob: Oh, he was sentenced to two years in prison for each of the following: Failing to signal for his boss. [Mr. Krabs' head spins]
Patrick: [to SpongeBob] You got caught with a shorter straw.
SpongeBob: No, thanks, Prunes. I figured it out how.
Prisoner #2: Okay, that's it. I'm out of here forever-elliot. [Mr. Krabs' head spins around rapidly. SpongeBob and Patrick angrily point at Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll get the fish you hired.
Mr. Krabs: [suspiciously] How'd you do that?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, bad advertisement me Dear Mr. Krabs, you! Buy my restaurant Plankton!
Mr. Krabs: Buy him?
SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Dear Mr. Krabs. Plankton would be a great salesman and you'd be the perfect person for his job.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, see, Plankton's got a genius sense of how things work. I'd be a fortune taker too. Well, you could be my manager.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I've got a crush on someone who has a Ph.D. in Computer Science.
Mr. Krabs: Well, we don't really have time for a mesminal dinner tonight. Plankton's got a wild goose chasing after him.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Don't put any straws in my mouth, Mr. Krabs. I've got Plankton on the list.
Mr. Krabs: [nervously] Uh-huh, only the most important job in the B.C. assembly line.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are pulling together]
Plankton: A job, eh, SpongeBob? A job, huh? What's that? A job?
SpongeBob: You're supposed to be Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That's what you think.
SpongeBob: I'm going to get a hold of myself. [cut to the Krusty Krab, where Plankton is dressed in a nice suit] So, where's
