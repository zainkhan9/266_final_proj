[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money, I've got as many as three choppers waiting for me.
[A convoy of limousines drive up to the Krusty Krab.]
Crowd: Clam shells!
Mr. Krabs: What the—[gasps] No, it's not—
Harold: They're there!
Crowd: Cannonballs!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What? No, no, they're here!
Crowd: Bunch bumbles! Cash!
Mr. Krabs: Here, take me cash!
SpongeBob: SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [gasps] No, no, they're here!
Crowd: Cash!
Mr. Krabs: Here d'affaires, here d'affaire.
Crowd: Bunch bumbles! Cash!
Mr. Krabs: Here d'affaires, here d'affaire.
Crowd: Bunch bumbles! Cash!
Mr. Krabs: Bunch bumbles! [crowd stops] What is it, folks? How does it look?
Fred: It's hideous!
Crowd: Bunch bumbles! [Mr. Krabs looks through them all and sees that SpongeBob, along with the crowd and some other bikers, are gone.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, everybody! Backing up!
[All of the bikers go back with Mr. Krabs' money while some are doing stunts they've done.]
Motorcycle Cop: Hey everybody! Backing up!
[Mr. Krabs and the motorcycle copiff come out and beat the bikers up. SpongeBob and the motorcycle copiff punch their chests.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's really neat! Backing up this saloon is pretty nice, but it's got a price.
Motorcycle Cop: Hey! What's that?
[Mr. Krabs blows the motorcycle copiff away with his supersonic punch. After he's launched through the Galley Grrrl, he knocks the motorcycle copiff away and the motorcycle copiff falls through Galley Grrrl stairs. After knocking the motorcycle copiff through some more floors, he takes the motorcycle copiff away. After knocking the motorcycle copiff through some more more floors, he returns to SpongeBob and the motorcycle copiff.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, can I punch another gun?
[SpongeBob pulls the trigger and starts a brawl. The brawl turns into an epic fail! where we see the motor bike copiff knocking the motorcycle copiff flat. The motorcycle copiff falls. SpongeBob swings back up into the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, no!
[SpongeBob and the motorcycle copiff plummet to the ground.]
Mr. Krabs: The motor bike copiff! He's gone! [sobs]
SpongeBob: Remember that night?

Mr. Krabs: I didn't.
[SpongeBob rips his trousers.]
SpongeBob: I didn't either.
[SpongeBob and the motorcycle copiff fly into the Fly To The Right Coffin.]
SpongeBob: My pants!
[SpongeBob and the motorcycle copiff fall down to the floor. The motorcycle copiff jumps into the Coffin and swings on the bonnet. SpongeBob jumps into the coffin and falls next to some guys.]
SpongeBob: Hey, gentlemen, I brought a spare cannon. [He pulls the cover open and pulls the cannon out. He throws it down. And when he gets back up, he sees that there's only one arrow stuck in it.] So I dove in and got the rest out a little less a-OK-what?
[SpongeBob notices that the arrow that was left in the body of the motor boat is stuck in the bonnet. He takes out the arrow.]
SpongeBob: That means we're heading for Bikini Bottom.
[SpongeBob takes out the arrow named after him.]
SpongeBob: Okey-dokey! Whoo-hoo-hoo! I can't wait to ride with you! [He falls out of the motor boat and goes back into his house. SpongeBob runs a short distance away from his house and then comes back out riding his motor boat] Whoo-hoo-hoo! [Then a noise is heard when a giant clam jumps on top of SpongeBob and starts to pumm
