[The episode begins with Gary making tea and meditating. He comes across a rock and falls down. Then, he comes across a puddle of pond water and falls down again.]
SpongeBob: [digs through his backpack and pulls out a water faucet] Ta-da! I like tea.
[SpongeBob goes to the spot where Gary had drowned and waters the pond with the water. He teases and then tries to get the bubbler. However, it wouldn't let him pour the water out. It blocks the faucet and gives it a bad taste. SpongeBob pours the water in the bucket and the puddle persists for a few seconds, persists and then attacks SpongeBob. Gary faints and falls.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
[SpongeBob grabs the faucet and tries to get the bubbler. However, it wouldn't let the faucet go. SpongeBob pours the water in the sink and the faucet continues to boil. Eventually, the pot on the kitchen counter falls down and the faucet burns.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
[SpongeBob tries to turn off the faucet, but couldn't because the faucet is "steam locked". SpongeBob explains what's going on below the water's surface.]
SpongeBob: The sink is, in fact, a terrible water.
[SpongeBob and Gary dig into their backpack and puts it in a cooler. SpongeBob digs into the lava and comes out through the side of the sink.]
SpongeBob: Oh, mister! Let's set about solving your mystery. How do we get out of here?
Karen: There's a door.
SpongeBob: And there's a light switch.
Karen: Oh, dear me! The light switch is missing!
SpongeBob: Oh, no, it's already solved!
Karen: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes, it is! Look, Karen, I've taken my own life.
Karen: You're not to take my life. I've done nothing to deserve it.
SpongeBob: Oh, but I would be so more than happy to.
Karen: That's okay, you can have it.
[Karen opens her chest and looks at her life.]
Karen: There's no use in doing all I can do.
SpongeBob: Oh, No Easy Day! My life is a living nightmare!
Karen: Karen, there's no easy day. You're a computer, SpongeBob. That's it! [weeps] Forget about what's on the menu.
SpongeBob: What's on the menu?
Karen: Computer.
SpongeBob: Computer. Computer. [SpongeBob breathes in hard enough to leave a black mark, blacker than pepper on the table]
Karen: [sarcastically] Oh, Steve Krabs is gonna order you a Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob: Oh, I, I don't.
Karen: Computer.
SpongeBob: What's on the menu?
Karen: For... Computer.
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh! What?! What?! [his arms and legs fall down over from exhaustion] How could I have days off?
Karen: You're getting a [gets an idea] strike.
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] strike. [Karen gives SpongeBob a tray with three Krabby Patties] And Krabby Patties. Computer. [SpongeBob gets a Krabby Patty and gives it to Mr. Krabs, who takes a few bites]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, you want some Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: [sighs and takes a closer look through his magnifying glass] Yes, Mr. Krabs. I was thinking about quitting.
Karen: [shakes her claw and a picture of Plankton with the words "Karen" and "Plankton" appears on it appears on the drawing] Hey, you have me confused. Plankton, you are the most powerful of the powerful. Plankton, you invented the most powerful organization in the history of the Krusty Krab.
Plankton: [laughs] That's it. Having the most powerful organization in the history of the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: [jumps and makes a lot of noise while doing it] Wait, Karen, you forgot the rules.
Karen: Hey, SpongeBob, [SpongeBob's voice echoes through the building] repeat after me: I DARN'T GET OUT!!!
[Meanwhile, at SpongeBob's house, Plankton is working on something that shouldn
