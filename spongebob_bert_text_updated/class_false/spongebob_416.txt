[Episode starts when SpongeBob's pineapple puts out an "open" sign. Meanwhile, inside, Squidward is working on his invention. He looks at the display as he speaks]
SpongeBob: It's time for another spectacular invention display! This time, I'm going to show you the most spectacular invention yet, private island-dom! [SpongeBob ties a rope onto the easel and gives it a knot] You knotty! You knotty! You knotty! [shows a picture of Squidward's treedome] You knotty! You knotty! You knotty!
Squidward: Whatcha doing, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: It all started when I was born. When I was a small, squirrell-proof newborn, you couldmill...
Squidward: Who cares? I made it!
SpongeBob: Yeah, it was the first time I was born and my mother was gonna name me Shelby.
Squidward: Oh, why am I crying? I got another great idea!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Totally Commercial-Free. [throws the baby rock down the hatch and places it in the truck's box] Whee-hoo-hoo! [SpongeBob drives off]
Squidward: Now that's the weird part. If you know what I mean, then you've seen the grand experiment of giving me money.
SpongeBob: Oh, that sounds fascinating!
Squidward: It is fascinating! Let me show you how it works. Now, I know you're not my type, but you're my type. [Squidward shows SpongeBob the panel picture] The experimenter gives me money. [SpongeBob nods] Now, what would be the name of this thing?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob blows the balloon out of the way] Spongy Patties.
Squidward: Oh, I'll have it already served to SpongeBob. [SpongeBob lands on the panel that shows Squidward] Now, what would be the name of this thing?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob blows the balloon out of the way] Goofy Goober.
Squidward: SpongeBob Goober.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob gives it a second chance] Spongy Patties.
Squidward: SpongeBob Patties. [SpongeBob gives it a third chance] Goofy Goober.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob gives it a second chance] Spongy Patties.
Squidward: Enough! Let's see if we got this already set up. [there's a second SpongeBob, he pulls the string] Wait a minute, SpongeBob. This is your first time?
SpongeBob: I did.
Squidward: And this is your first chance.
SpongeBob: I did?
Squidward: Yeah. Let's see if we can... uh, do what we do.
SpongeBob: Do what we do.
Squidward: Uh, like throwballs?
SpongeBob: Uh, like jumpers?
Squidward: Uh, like jumpers?
SpongeBob: Uh, like jumpers?
Squidward: Yeah. I'll show you how. [gets off the truck and puts it on the boatmobile] Uh, what does that do?
SpongeBob: Well, first, it jump shots a path of trajectory for the ballistic belt. Then, it uses that path to deliver the globus cord, which is what this glove is made of. [SpongeBob attaches the globus cord using his left hand] Now, we're gonna go for a walk, eh?
Squidward: Someday we'll be able to talk like that.
SpongeBob: Sure.
Squidward: How about now?
SpongeBob: Yeah. [lifts his rock up high with his right hand]
Squidward: Okay. Let's probably think of a little business model.
SpongeBob: [lifts his rock up high with his left hand] Hahaha. That sounds like a great idea, Squidward.
Squidward: Yes!
SpongeBob: Hmm... [laughs]
Squidward: Right. Let's do some experimenting.
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward, could you try it on? [Squidward does so]
Squidward: [enraged] YES, Ive got a perfect glove!
SpongeBob: Okay. [laughs]
Squidward: Now think, I'm doing it...
SpongeBob: [amazed] Wow. That tickles!
Squidward: Of course I'm doing it. Now think
