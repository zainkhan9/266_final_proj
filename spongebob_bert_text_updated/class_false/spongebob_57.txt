SpongeBob: [screams] I'm suffering from the B-R-A-T-E. [giggles and runs off to his work clothesline. sipping a soda] The Krusty Krab is not for me! [leaps at Squidward's body with a spatula]
Squidward: [screams and jumps up to the ceiling] Open up, SpongeBob! I'm not properly nourished.
SpongeBob: I'm suffering from the B-R-A-T-E.
Squidward: [walks out of the Krusty Krab onto his hands] Who's to say my b-r-a-t-e is over?
SpongeBob: I'm suffering from the B-R-A-T-E.
Squidward: Squidward, are you talking to me?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs says not to worry, Squidward. [Puts b-ratting on Squidward's face and gets off of SpongeBob] There. That way, I'm not subject to the wrath of Squidward! [Puts feet out to sea] That's right, Squidward.
Squidward: That's right.
SpongeBob: All right, let's get back to subjection's start, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Subjection's start? I'm not subject to anything but the run of the mill. I've never seen anything quite like it. Let's get out of here, boy.
