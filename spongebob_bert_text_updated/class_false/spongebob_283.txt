Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what in Davy Jones' locker is going on?
SpongeBob: [offscreen] [scene starts] What do we know about Davy Jones? How are we gonna get our star lineups ready for tonight's "Fresh Off the Boat" special?
Mr. Krabs: [scene starts] It's a secret.
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs, every employee has the right to a single story. But if you don't tell it, it's going to be a bunch of busybody stories.
Mr. Krabs: [scene starts] Stop! Tell it to me!
SpongeBob: Yes, please.
Mr. Krabs: Okay.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [starting crying] AHH!!! Mr. Kraus...! [SpongeBob and Patrick are sobbing loudly, and stop abruptly. They hold each other and SpongeBob starts to get emotional. Patrick runs over, and he and SpongeBob start to scratch their backs]
Mr. Krabs: Boys, boys, boys! Boys, boys! [everyone is going to the bathroom, screaming, and taking their places in a fetal position] C'mon, c'mon! Boys, come out there and give me another special day! [notices an old television sitting on the floor] Ooh, why don't you give it a try? It's gonna be so much better than that old filthy "boring" "old" "wasteful" "fannish" "TV". Yeah, you heard me.
Patrick: Let's get back to work! [Patrick enters the office. SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick sit back into their desks. Mr. Krabs pokes his head through the cubicle wall]
Mr. Krabs: Today's the first day of the week. [SpongeBob looks at the clock]
SpongeBob: Well, all week long, eh? I amwell?
Mr. Krabs: Eh, scooch! [SpongeBob gets mad. Cut to later]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you today?
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, well, uh, uh, man, I was just going to say that I love Krabby Patties.
Patrick: Well, uh, man, uh, man, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
SpongeBob: And that makes me all the more puzzled.
Patrick: Hmm?
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh!
Patrick: Oh, oh! Are there any of you working...
SpongeBob: No, I mean...
Patrick: Can I help you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, help you begin to do it. [SpongeBob shows him a pile of cash, one of which is full]
Patrick: I'll take all of it. [SpongeBob leans towards him] Don't be shy, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob leans towards Patrick] Thank you. [SpongeBob starts to struggle in] The point is, all you are trying to do is destroy me business. [SpongeBob explodes. Patrick screams. SpongeBob crashes into him into pieces] The point is, now is it's time for me to be shot! [SpongeBob starts crying into a golf ball] To the front lines. The point is, now is it's time for me to be shot! [SpongeBob is getting ready to fire, but Patrick is waiting in front of him] The point is, now is it's time for me to be shot! [SpongeBob is getting squeezed in his hole. Squidward walks over]
Squidward: I'm not getting shot. That was a ..."Go, Jerk! Go!, "Go, Jerk!" Go!
Patrick: [slaps SpongeBob] Don't, Squidward! It'll crush my confidence!
Squidward: You are a menace to public life?
SpongeBob: I hate to appear you way you are, Squidward, but I am a menace to public life. [shot ketchup over his head] Shoot, yeah... [shot over who he thinks is the parrot] Oh, yeah.
Patrick: [slaps SpongeBob again] Don't bother me. [shot over who wants what] Oh, yeah.
