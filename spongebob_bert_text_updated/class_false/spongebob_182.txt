SpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary. [yelps as he wakes up. SpongeBob climbs on the bed and slips on the "Sleep" button. This makes Gary feel much, much smaller] Gary? [pounds on the door]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [opens door] What in Davy Jones' locker is going on in here, Gary? Oh, Neptune, what am I doing? Must be getting somewhere. [pushes the bed button. Dale and his house buck man: crash and burn]
Gary: [gasp] Meow. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Oh, Neptune, what am I doing? Ahh, home sweet dream! [sees his house is burnt] Hey! My house is burnt! What the...? [sees his house is burnt again] Great! That's my house! I could use new lights! [takes out a flashlight, opens it, and looks under it] Oh, there isn't a home. [shadow appears over Gary. Gary's house falls down into the ground and blocks SpongeBob's flashlight.] Gary! [rings bell] Home sweet dream! [bows]
Gary: Meow. [wakes up]
SpongeBob: Oh, Neptune, what am I dreaming? [takes out his flashlight and made a hole in the roof] Aww, look around me, I see only me house! [hugs Gary] What's going on here!? [SpongeBob breaks free] SpongeBob! What's going on!? [runs over to the cuckoo clock tower, which also crushes him] Who's awake?!
tower: Attention, the earth is rumbling and the sky is shining! The participants in the 10-hour-long S.N.C.A.T.R.T: Firearm Gang Escape! have been let out of jail and have instead escaped with their police-appeal-der. [shuts the door, then plays their lullaby]
Everyone: Hooray!
SpongeBob: It's working!
[plays his song for them, and then cuts to the Krusty Krab. Under the grill, the barrel has become a toy, and customers are biting their arms and legs]
Squidward: I can't wait to see what this suntan lot has up against. [Squidward rings the counter]
Mr. Krabs: Hi there, what're you folks doing?
Squidward: I'm not paying you to stand behind this register anymore. I'm paying you to respect my authority, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Respect my authority?
Squidward: Respect my authority?
Mr. Krabs: Okay, respect my authority. [takes out a pencil and draws a mustache]
Squidward: This is the last straw! [runs over to the cash register, then leaps over the counter to see it empty] Wait, no, this isn't my clarinet. [gulps] This isn't my clarinet. I want this counter. [runs over to the cash register again, this time with a box] I want this box. [gulps] I want these boxes. [walks over to the chair, then jumps in] I want these chairs. [walks over to SpongeBob] I want these tables.
Mr. Krabs: Well, well, well, if it isn't me master plot to get Krabby Patties back! And I'm gonna need that box I showed you, Mr. Squidward. [picks up the box] This should be easy. [pulls out the pencil and draws a rectangle on the paper] The Krabby Patty secret formula-fileshrine box. [starts to draw a grinder to grind the formula into a shape] Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, this is all my fault. I was doing it to get Krabby Patties back.
SpongeBob: So you're not going to do it on purpose?
Mr. Krabs: Of course not. [shows up]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs, this is terrible! How are you going to come back?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I was doing it to get Krabby Patties back.
SpongeBob: Well, well, if it isn't me fault! Squidward, if you want Krabby Patties back, then you should go back to the Krusty Krab! There, Mr. Krabs, I still get them Krabby Patties. [lifts his head up] Look, Squidward, Mr. Krabs put a sweater on me. [puts the sweater on Squidward] Oh,are you going to believe
