[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is once again busy trying to get SpongeBob's employee card.]
Mr. Krabs: [gets an idea] Oh, you may be an employee, but are you Squidward's employee card?
[SpongeBob gets his card, but accidentally opens it and it turns out to be a paper airplane.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what's with the fly-away policy?
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, erron. I'm on it. Yup, I was on the program last night, and I was on the fly!
[SpongeBob laughs hysterically. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and Squidward's boss at work. SpongeBob enters the office and tries to give Squidward his official resignation.]
SpongeBob: Salutations, boss! I am Mr. Krabs! [holds out his index finger and index finger scrunchie] A true artist, I say, he gives his all to make this great country great again!
Mr. Krabs: [rubs his finger all over Squidward] Oh, me dear! Oh, oh! This isn't so bad! [laughs] And I'm right here! [takes his hand away] And this isn't so bad! or this is okay! or this is really great!
Squidward: Are you ready to be great?
[Mr. Krabs pushes his face down on the table and it pops. It then starts dancing around inside. Squidward screams and runs away.]
SpongeBob: [notices a pile of letters on the floor] Squidward, you're scolding me.
[SpongeBob jumps inside and sees that the letter is actually a letter to Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: So, Mr. Krabs, are you ready for work and bon voyage? [sticks his index finger in and out and yells] Hmph! I almost had it! [sighs] Did you see how I handled that? [shouts another letter and kicks it; he runs through a bunch of letter boards] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Hahaha!
[Squidward kicks the letter in the air and runs away.]
SpongeBob: I guess that's what makes you so miserable.
[Mr. Krabs and Squidward continue to dance around. Mr. Krabs throws the letter board on Squidward's head and changes it to a coat hanger. He walks away and goes to wash his hands.]
SpongeBob: Oh, that looks terrible.
Mr. Krabs: [opens the coat hanger] "Washing my hands."
SpongeBob: So, if you can't wash your hands, can you?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, sure you can. [gives SpongeBob the coat]
SpongeBob: [gasps] I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you say that?!
Mr. Krabs: Well, if you can't wash your [writes back a coat] can you cheese it? [writes back a coat] Yep! [writes back another coat] How about this one?
SpongeBob: Well, it's a canvas! [puts the other one on the coat and it jumps out on top]
Mr. Krabs: Yes, it is!
[SpongeBob looks pretty annoyed. He looks at the coat and see is there a fur coat under it. Mr. Krabs takes the coat off SpongeBob's head.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, stop it! Look at the old me! Why, I'm just like all the other me's! [changes his head to SpongeBob's normal body] I'm all over you, SpongeBob-girl.
SpongeBob: Say some good things, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Speaking of good things... [turns around and points to his new body] I think I'd rather be a monster myself.
SpongeBob: I just don't get it. I'm too soft. Oh.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boy, oh boy! I think you'd be a stinky dog if you tried. What do you say we charge you?
SpongeBob:12 dollars? What do I say? 12 dollars? [Mr. Krabs blinks with a bright bright eyes] I'll take the coat test, and stay! I'll get down to it! I'll get the hang of it! I'll get the hang of it!
Mr. Krabs: But that's me. No one else would wear a paying job suit like you.
SpongeBob: Well, I'd like that, Mr. Krabs!
