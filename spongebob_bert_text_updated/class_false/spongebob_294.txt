[Episode starts when SpongeBob is riding his bike to work. He parks his boat and tries to get the pedaling wheel, but he gets tangled on the pedaling wheel. He gets into his boat and tries to pedal to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [drives the boat to the Krusty Krab] HahAAHAAHAAHAAAAAAAAA.
[The boat hits the Chum Bucket, causing the bucket to erupt in slime. SpongeBob gets himself tangled on the pedaling wheel and gets caught on the pole. The pedaling wheel then spits him out.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
[SpongeBob continues to drive the Chum Bucket until he reaches the Krusty Krab. He gets caught on the pole's electrical outlet and gets slapped by Gary. Gary growls at SpongeBob, knocking off his glasses. SpongeBob pushes his boat away from the electrical outlet and walks to the Krusty Krab. He meets with Hagfish Patty who tells him that he is being treated for a throat illness.]
Hagfish Patty: [sheds a tear] Oh, good.
[SpongeBob speeds off and goes a little unsteady on the gas pedal. This forces him to give up hoping and gets him to wait for a fish that is about to eat him. The Hagfish Patty looks at SpongeBob and smells the grease on his hands. His eyes pop out and he sees a monster fish eating SpongeBob.]
Hagfish Patty: I hate to say it, but it's a slow process.
[The Hagfish Patty reaches the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is served.]
SpongeBob: Thank you, Hagfish Patty.
[SpongeBob notices the Hagfish Patty struggling to get his body through the doors. He gets impatient and serves him some ketchup. The ketchup color is changed to a scary green and the fish eats SpongeBob. The fish spits ketchup out at SpongeBob, sending him in the air and flying into Sandy's cereal box. The fish jumps out of the cereal box and onto SpongeBob's head to eat the ketchup. SpongeBob gets so distracted by the Hagfish Patty's thoughts, he doesn't notice that the cereal box is filled with ketchup. The Krusty Krab closes itself up and SpongeBob straightens out his outfit. SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab with his clarinet recital to him in mind.]
SpongeBob: [mumbles] ♪I have no mind.♪ [spins around and meets himself in the front of the actual Krusty Krab] ♪I am the only fish in the sea.♪ [gets attacked by the fish all by himself and screams]
[The flashback ends to show the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob is shown in the front with the clarinet.]
Plankton: [reads] Me warm, avenge me beloved. [breathes heavily after realizing he is not going to sing] ♪I have never felt such love.♪
[The flashback has ended.]
Karen: [sheds a tear she has been holding at Plankton's] ♪I have never felt so alive.♪
Plankton: ♪And precious little thought has been given to the long standing tradition of the SquarePants Brothers. Which, by O'Brian, is supported by record.♪
Karen: ♪And that is why we alter the music to play when the opportunity presents itself.♪
[The Chum Bucket changes the music to scream and jazz. The scene cuts to a montage of images. It starts with an image of SpongeBob wearing a hat and a thought bubble of SpongeBob and Squidward. The Chum Bucket thought bubble turns on. SpongeBob turns it on. An image of Plankton is shown.]
Plankton: Fancy.♪
Karen: ♪While you are altering the music, I have the sense you consider it a special treat.♪
Plankton: ♪To hear it play live is a reality.♪
