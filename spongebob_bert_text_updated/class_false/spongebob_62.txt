<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick skipping down the Main Title screen with no episode left.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. I'm so glad you found our new home. I'm glad you found our place.
[Patrick is shown sleeping. The phone rings.]
Patrick: SpongeBob, my house is all yours!
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, my house is all yours! What now?
Patrick: What now?
SpongeBob: My new house.
Patrick: My new house?
SpongeBob: My new house!
Patrick: [his house is shown] My new house?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Ha. Now you can hang your big house.
Patrick: Do I go upstairs, or downstairs?
SpongeBob: You get on the roof. [jumps on the roof and falls down, splashing his house] Oh, my house! My big house! My big big house! Now you can hang your big house!
Patrick: Do I get bigger, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [Squidward is shown with Dennis] Yes, sir. [shows his head] Now start the episode. The Goodlands. [moves off]
[The episode begins with Patrick skipping outside his house.]
Patrick: Ugh. My stupid pole isn't up to my "pride". [hides himself]
[SpongeBob is shown sleeping and on the ground are sad and angry people.]
SpongeBob: Hey, where you guys are, what's going on?
Fish: Hello? Where do you live?
Patrick: I don't know, but there are some nice, tall houses in the middle of the park.
Fish: Well, that's more like it. Everybody knows that place.
[The scene changes to show Tom and Debbie going to the park.]
Tom: And that was my favorite episode of the entire competition.
Debbie: Yeah! The main problem with taller houses over stairs is that they get crevassed. So I take it back. [Debbie pulls back on the railing]
Tom: And you walk away, too. [Debbie pulls back on the railing]
[The scene changes to show Mrs. Puff's Boating School house.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mrs. Puff, can I have a closer look?
Mrs. Puff: Sure. Uh-huh. [SpongeBob walks up to Mrs. Puff and stares into her helmet. He then lifts his eyes up to the sky and a helmet pops out on his head.] The view from this much fact means that if I were to get a front-row seat, I might even get a view of what really matters in this household!
[Mrs. Puff puts her keys in her bag and leaves. SpongeBob comes back and gets in between the two houses.]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I have so many questions.
Mrs. Puff: What do I know?
SpongeBob: I can't answer them.
[Mrs. Puff puts her keys in her bag again and comes back with a stack of questions.]
Mrs. Puff: What's your secret love life?
SpongeBob: I've got a secret love life!
[Mrs. Puff ends up getting back in SpongeBob's taxi and drives away to the Krusty Krab.]
Mrs. Puff: [laughs] You're not gonna get me work, are you?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. No, I'm a fool. I've got a secret love life. I've got a secret love life, I've got a secret love life, I've got a secret love love life.
[Mrs. Puff ends up taking SpongeBob and his taxi with them to the Krusty Krab.]
Mrs. Puff: And now, my precious, behind you justitia, I request a signature from the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: [signs onto SpongeBob's taxi] Here it is!
[Mrs. Puff extracts the taxi and gives it to SpongeBob.]
Mrs. Puff: Amazing!
SpongeBob: Naw... who said that? Huh? What? Huh?
[Mrs. Puff closes her eyes and begins to thinking. She is now convinced that Mrs. Puff ordered SpongeBob to get a ride with the receipt.]
SpongeBob: Yay, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: What kind of secret love life would a 9-year-old get for brunch?
SpongeBob: Just kidding.
[Mrs. Puff gasps. SpongeBob walks over with an usher standing by to explain the rules. The usher explains the ruleset as follows: â€œ
