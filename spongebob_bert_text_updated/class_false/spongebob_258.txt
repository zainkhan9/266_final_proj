[Episode starts with Gary watching TV]
SpongeBob: Are you sure that the gutter's too wide?
Gary: [grins evilly]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I have to walk them three more blocks, then the old barn will roars! [continues to cause huge destruction] 
[Patrick is using a ladder to get down from the top of the gutter to get a view of SpongeBob and Gary. He then builds a ladder to the second story window. He goes up to the top, touches the bottom and falls flat on the floor. He then uses araperysms to push himself up to the top. He then uses the top of the gutter to climb back down, but the bottom of his ladder breaks.]
SpongeBob: I don't know how. Is it collapsing buildings, Patrick? Or, [lights flash and sparkles] is he just going to explode, crackling, crackling, crackling! 
Patrick: I don't know. [he is holding a big dynamite ball and it falls on his face]
SpongeBob: [Patrick is laughing and playing with his eyes closed] What the? 
Patrick: I think he's winning this wrestling match.
SpongeBob: [screams] No, no, get away! [gets smacked around his body by the dynamite ball] 
Patrick: My body is fine! [screams and runs away] 
SpongeBob: I don't know. Is it food poisoning my kids or wife Nancy? [smacks hands] Food? 
Patrick: It's food poisoning my kids.
SpongeBob: No, no, no, get away! Food all over my couch! [screams and grabs kitchen key] 
Patrick: My wife has a box of boxes! Food all over her couch! [SpongeBob and Patrick run off] 
SpongeBob: Oh no, it's not food! Food's poisoning my wife and kids! [runs over to a sofa and smashes headlong into it] Food all over my couch! [SpongeBob and Patrick get poisoned] 
Patrick: I have a couch, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob smashes into the sofa, and Patrick gets poisoned] 
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is in a crab's belly, and the crab looks in surprise] Whoa, whoa, food all over my couch! [SpongeBob is running off, and Patrick gets poisoned] 
Patrick: SpongeBob, that's the food-in-a-nog. Drink straight, and avoid heights of the world's food. [SpongeBob runs off, and Patrick gets poisoned] 
SpongeBob: [running] Drink all over my couch! Oh no! [Patrick gets slapped, and SpongeBob runs off] 
SpongeBob: [runs down the street] Drink all over his couch! [SpongeBob gets poisoned] Whoa, whoa, food all over his couch! [SpongeBob gets poisoned] 
Nat: [walks by with a reef pencil and has a couch full of worms] Bring me some peanuts, hay, and socks, and bring them over. [Craw-on Worms comes over, and eats the peanut.] 
SpongeBob: Patrick, I guess that's too much jelly. [Patrick drinks some of the jelly, and starts drinking it through the window, and then poison-swallows it] Patrick, that's all you did. [Patrick drinks some of the poison-swoops-ya-rama. He then angrily Sucks the worm in his popcorn box] 
Patrick: All better? [SpongeBob looks annoyed, and runs outside, and runs, and runs, and runs, and runs, and runs, and runs] 
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick! 
Patrick: What's going on? 
SpongeBob: Patrick, my throat feels dry. 
Patrick: Oh, just the same. Your kitchen is the only place that matters to me. 
SpongeBob: When? 
Patrick: Later. 
SpongeBob: Don't get your jaw off your knuckles, Patrick. I'm trying to stay above water. [Both tug on the hose which is meant to help] 
Patrick: No, my kitchen! [SpongeBob blows around a propeller, and into the hose which is meant to save him. Patrick runs off] 
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick! 
Patrick: What's going on? 
SpongeBob: I must have been watering my mouth like a... horse. 
Patrick: No horse? No horse... no horse. No horse at all. 
SpongeBob: [screams and hides behind the sofa] horse!
