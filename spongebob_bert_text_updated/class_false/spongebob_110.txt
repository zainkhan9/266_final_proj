Squidward: Uh, Squidward?
SpongeBob: It's Squidward.
Squidward: You? SpongeBob? Where? 
SpongeBob: In the bathroom.
Squidward: How long you been in the shower, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [gasps] The fountain.
Squidward: Is that what you call a water fountain?
SpongeBob: Well, I... uh... [points to the water fountain] ...found a... water torture device.
Squidward: A water torture device?
SpongeBob: Well, yes.
Squidward: What's it about the...
SpongeBob: It's... well, it's actually quite sophisticated, isn't it, Squidward?
Squidward: [startled] No, no, no, no, no, no! What kind of a guy wears a water torture device?
SpongeBob: Well, uh, it's... uh... [flashback to Mr. Krabs and Squidward laughing]
Squidward: Oh, boy, Mr. Krabs! Look at what I did to you. I'm going to do it again!
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, Squidward, I don't think my sister would recognize you if you were a dollar a piece.
Squidward: [scoffs] Calm down. She's talking about toys.
SpongeBob: Yeah, she's talking about toys! Now, Squidward, why didn't anyone tell me?!
Squidward: I dunno, why not? [SpongeBob and Squidward look at each other and laugh]
SpongeBob: Okay, don't upset him. She's the one who, um, says, "Hey, you, you, look at that." [SpongeBob and Squidward laugh]
Squidward: [angrily slams the door in SpongeBob's face] That tickles, and over.
SpongeBob: Yeah, tickles, tickles, tickles. [tickles again]
Squidward: [still laughing] I said, "Hey, when SpongeBob sees those two, they'll have to be payback me for years of complaining!"
SpongeBob: Right. [tries to take the spatula]
Squidward: What did you say?
SpongeBob: "I'll try to explain, if you like, if you like to chew. [chuckles]
Squidward: [interrupts] Oh, gracious. [bubble transition to Patrick's house] Patrick here has to be on his way to work. [changes channel to Cactus Fields, then to SpongeBob's house] I'll have two happy endings here. Either I get spat at again, or I get eviscerated by the native arachnids. [eviscerates arachnid mollusk. He takes the spatula] Or...
Patrick: [again, changes channel] Hey, SpongeBob, how you doing?
SpongeBob: [changes channel] Hey, Patrick, how you doing?
Patrick: [changes channel] Yeah, SpongeBob, I heard you!
SpongeBob: [notices] Uh, Patrick, listen. I don't think you're ready.
Patrick: Okay, I'm not ready! [He points to nothing]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you don't understand! I can't believe what I'm hearing! [cries]
Patrick: It can't be right, SpongeBob. What is it?
SpongeBob: [laughs] I told you. You're making noises.
Patrick: Oh. noises.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Look, Patrick, my sister is having an argument with an apartment.
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: She's saying she's going to attack.
Patrick: Well, she must be kidding.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Look, Patrick, all this gold and all this hot air is making me hungry. [looks over to a pile of papers and Patrick is eating it with his teeth] Hey, this gold and all this hot air is making me hungry! [he puts a tablecloth over the pile of papers and puts his teeth on it] [he walks up to the front of the pile, which is actually Squidward's lawn chair. He looks down] [to the table] There you go.
Patrick: [looks over to Mr. Krabs] No, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you can't be hungry at work!
Patrick: Well, why don't you work like a whiny dog? [SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: If you can't be hungry, who is?
Patrick: I
