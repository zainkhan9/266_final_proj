[episode starts with Gary doing a pampering with his pampering parlor w/ Patrick]
Friend #1: [screaming while jumping on a flower and doing karate with his friends] Sweetie, get your heart out of here! [stops and notices ice cream] Hey, that's no ice cream. Sweetie, get your heart out of here!
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Patrick.
Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob, teal is just a prototype. See, there are limits to knowledge.
SpongeBob: Limits?
Patrick: Knowledge of every kind is a state of the art.
SpongeBob: Behold, the final test of the amazing Patrick-Patrick-Patrick-Patrick-Patrick [takes out a tape that says "Grandma's Leaving"] is it?
Patrick: Absolutely! It's even closer than that!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh. Scene cuts to the green planet Krunming, where SpongeBob and Patrick are still laughing. Squidward is laughing in excitement.]
Squidward: Ew!
[Squidward looks for SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Squidward: You wanna help me?
[SpongeBob and Patrick both laugh]
SpongeBob: Well, alright, but...
[Squidward looks for Patrick.]
Squidward: He doesn't want to be the first to hear it.
Patrick: Well, that's quite alright, because we are friends for a reason.
Squidward: Why's this, Patrick?
Patrick: Why's that, Squidward? Because I like you!
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Squidward: You must be enjoying the video...
SpongeBob: Cameras.
Patrick: Cameras?!?!?!
Squidward: Cameras. Cameras.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh again. Later, Squidward is in his house with his books and his thoughts are all over the television.]
Squidward: I've had my answer all as time. I find time to stop and think. [leans back and looks at the television] It's almost time for another day. [he turns off the television] Good night, Squidward.
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: [muffled and irritated] What the...? SpongeBob, Patrick, did you do?
SpongeBob: Squidward asked for it. It was his will.
Patrick: I didn't give it to you.
Squidward: Whatever.
SpongeBob: Evil always comes first.
Patrick: Well, maybe we can find something to help.
[scene cuts to the TV where SpongeBob and Patrick are watching the SpongeBob cartoon]
SpongeBob: Good thing I brought this TV. It gives me instant feedback.
Patrick: Better what?
SpongeBob: It loosens up the popcorn.
Patrick: Aye yae yae.
SpongeBob: I like popcorn, don't I?
Patrick: Well, I did say "an instant feedback" after I said "essay".
SpongeBob: Well, I'd like to know. What is your take?
Patrick: [sarcastically] Oh, I've been working on my SpongeBob thing. Right, SpongeBob, I want you to have something to say.
SpongeBob: Anything! Anything!
Patrick: Sure.
SpongeBob: Well, uh, okay. [holds out a straw]
[Scene cuts to the TV displaying the Tonight Show Tonight!]
Tonight Show Host: And now, live from Bikini Bottom, each week's episode launches a brand-new 24-hour news cycle that itty-bitty, the "Tonight Show"...
SpongeBob: The "Tonight Show!" Now listen, each and every one of you watching this online stream, you've invited me to your next event. You've said you're not interested in it.
Tonight Show Host: No...
SpongeBob: Well, I'd love to...
Tonight Show Host: But you've said you won't be.
SpongeBob: But what if I say that I won't?
Tonight Show Host: Well, I'd say you might win the Tony for Best SpongeBob Ever, but you wouldn't be if you were talkin' about it.
SpongeBob: That's the last thing I would want, sir.
Tonight Show Host: Well, I wouldn't put it on the list.
SpongeBob: But then you wouldn't be if you were talkin' about it.
Tonight Show Host: Well, I wouldn't put it on the list either. You couldn't win without talk.
SpongeBob: C'mon, Gary
