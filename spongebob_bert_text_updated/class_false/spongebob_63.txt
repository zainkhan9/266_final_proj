[The scene opens up for SpongeBob to try a grab. He makes a sandwich, and hears Patrick's foghorn]
Patrick: Hmm? [sees SpongeBob eating his sandwich] Hmm. [Walks over and holds up a bowl of chips] Hmm. [Hands SpongeBob a bowl of condiments] Hmm. [Pushes him away, grabs a dollar, and juice comes out of it] Nothing like the natural world, eh, Patrick?
SpongeBob: [Starts walking away, and reaches for Patrick's dollar, but Patrick pulls it back]
Patrick: Uhh, stop! [SpongeBob continues walking, and reaches for SpongeBob's dollar, but SpongeBob pulls it back]
SpongeBob: Hmm? [sees an opening in the floorboards of the Ferris Wheel, and begins looking for a button, and the Galley Potty opens] Ooh…Something wrong, pal? I can't take it no more! I must get going!
Patrick: SpongeBob, please take me to Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? You were transporting Krabby Patties here at the…
Patrick: Galleon? [begins to shake the Galley Potty] Wha? I'm getting one! One Krabby Patty and one drink! Uh, pardon me, Gare-Bear, but can I give you the Kool-aid?
Gare-Bear: All right! One drink, one coat, one ride on the Kelp-O? All for me, one good ol' home!
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo! [takes the Kool-Aid and makes his way to the kitchen] I am coming to the Krusty Krab home for the long haul. [notices the Krusty Krab key]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob, this is a great deal. [SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen] Hey, SpongeBob? You have the key!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah I do, sir. [looks behind him to grab the key] I can't take it no more! [opens the kitchen door] Home sweet home.
Mr. Krabs: Well, there's nothing like a little live-action footage to make you cry.
SpongeBob: But I can't take my Krusty Krab any more. [cries]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob, you're so smart, you really know what you're doing.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. [later at the Krusty Krab] You're all right, you're all right, but the order's kinda kind of lukewarm. I suppose I can take one more look at your uniform, Plankton.
Plankton: I dunno, Krabs. I'm kind of expecting a much better show from you. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I do have a better idea.
Plankton: [pokes SpongeBob] Do you take that as fact?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That is, sir. [laughs and walks away chuckling]
Plankton: Wait, just one more thing. Your uniform will look terrible. [leaves]
SpongeBob: So, you don't want to be humiliated or anything?
Plankton: No, just the show.
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's it. I'll just cut to the chase. [he jumps on the cash register and spits it out] Here you go. [licks the "F" shape on the glass]
Plankton: [reads off the "F" shape on the glass] ...flatulent?! [screams and runs around] Come on. What's that?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Plankton just spit in that direction?! That makes me think he's got something wrong.
Plankton: Uhh, well,tainment value of nothing, I see.
SpongeBob: Gosh, isn't that the pretty one?
Plankton: Uh-huh, SpongeBob? I think I'd say I'm... [points to a billboard] I'm "communicating with you idiots" with nothing to be ashamed of.
SpongeBob: Really?
Plankton: Yeah, that's the pretty one here.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm just here to show you what I really think is wrong with the Krusty Krab.
Plankton: Uhh, well, I'd like to make a toast.
[SpongeBob notices the "Toss Off"]
SpongeBob: Hm. Yeah, this is pretty cool. But who's gonna be the toast?
Plankton:
