[Episode starts when SpongeBob and Patrick come into Squidward's house and Squidward opens the door.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow!
Squidward: You really unclog the toilet?
SpongeBob: We can do it! We just have to go up there and grab ahold of his... [holds up a toy urchin] ...fry bowl. Aw, I wonder what he's got there. [pulls out remains of the urchin] I bet he's hungry.
Patrick: He's not?
SpongeBob: No, Squidward's right. We just have to eat something.
Patrick: I want a Krabby Patty! [holds up a french fry]
Squidward: No, I don't! [shows the remains of his urchin stomach to Patrick] Au revoir. You don't want to be late for work. [closes the door] That's enough! Using SpongeBob as a guinea pig... [clips SpongeBob's urchin head and shows it to Patrick] ...is just fine... [pulls his urchin stomach again]...in that case, you'll be going on duty. [leaves with the urchin head]
SpongeBob: Bye, Squidward!
Squidward: Beggar fish, beggar! [walks out of his house] Now, Squidward! [now inside, he imagines that he is surrounded by his best friends. The house is filled with clams and other creatures that look like Squidward. The scene cuts to SpongeBob as he tries to look for Squidward in the mirror.]
SpongeBob: Um, Squidward? [there is a misspelled name on his nose. It is Patrick. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob as he is walking to the Krusty Krab] No.
Patrick: Oh, welcome, Squidward! [SpongeBob appears from the shadows] Aww, wasn't that fun? [closes the door and prepares to walk out but then suddenly, without warning, jumps out of the shadows. The scene cuts to an employee drawing of Squidward]
Employee: Oh, sorry, but you are a ghost in the workplace. You are no fun at all! [walks out]
SpongeBob: But I'll have some fun on the job! And some fun!
Patrick: Yeah, I'll have some fun on the job too! And some fun on the job! And some fun on the job!
SpongeBob: You won't believe the magic of the lamp! [shows a small lamp with wires and a button on the top with a button to flip the bun down] You'll need a special tool for workmanship.
Employee: Thank you for your turn. But can I... [turns the lamp on its side] ...turn to the right? [SpongeBob gasps] Wrong! The right way! [SpongeBob lands on the bottom of the lamp, turns it upside-down, and lets go of it. Then does so. The small button turns it upside-down and sticks. Then SpongeBob turns it upside-up and looks left and appears on the bottom of the lamp as the small button turns it upside-down. SpongeBob turns it upside-down, but the large square button turns it upside-down.] Wrong! [SpongeBob gasps again] Wrong! [SpongeBob turns the small square button upside-down again. The handle turns SpongeBob upside-down again. SpongeBob's nose pops out of his head again.] Wrong! [SpongeBob turns the large square button upside-down again. The handle turns SpongeBob upside-down again. SpongeBob's nose pops out of his nose again.] Wrong! [SpongeBob turns the small square button upside-down. SpongeBob's nose pops out of his nose again.] Wrong! [SpongeBob turns the large square button upside-down.] Wrong!
Patrick: Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I'm no longer your employee.
SpongeBob: You did the right thing, Patrick, you loyal employee.
Mr. Krabs: Loyalty? That's not even a right...
SpongeBob: [as he speaks] Uh, sorry.
Mr. Krabs: You know, there's nothing wrong with me. Well, I'm sure if I'd had a little more money...
SpongeBob: [whispers] Mr. Krabs, you're not a cashier.
Mr. Krabs: No, wait, son. I'm a... [SpongeBob starts to cry] cashier!
SpongeBob: Really, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs? You're crying like you're drowning!
Mr. Krabs: I'm drowning? Oh
