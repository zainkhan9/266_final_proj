Narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery. Where it will be closing time right about...
Squidward: [talks cheerfully as he switches the "Open" sign to "Closed"] Now! 8:00! So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is: [pulls out his clarinet] Clarinet. [Tom shows up at the door and knocks on it, causing Squidward to drop his clarinet] What?
Tom: Are you open?
Squidward: [points to the sign] Read the sign.
Tom: [ignores him] I'll have a Krabby Patty Deluxe and a Double Chili Kelp Fries.
Squidward: NO, YOU WON'T. I can't hang out here all night. I've got a life!
Tom: Well, fine, if you don't want my money!
Mr. Krabs: [says cheerfully] Money?! [Mr. Krabs then falls from the ceiling on top of Squidward] You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?
Tom: [pulls out cash; Sadie, an anchovy, and an old man appear behind him] Sure!
Announcer: [off-screen] DAY DAY!
SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs: Hooray!
Squidward: [shakes his head to nighttime] Well, that was pretty good. Goodbye, new customers. [shakes his head to the nighttime, daytime, until the morning]
Mr. Krabs: [a humanized octopus, gently kissing his lower intestine, turns off the TV] Yoo hoo! I'm gonna get a Krabby Patty Deluxe and a Double Chili Kelp Fries.
SpongeBob: Happy eleventy-seventh?
Mr. Krabs: Yes. [Squidward leaves with the clarinet and SpongeBob's screams of surprise; Mr. Krabs laughs while Squidward cries] You see, today is a different, different, different... [Squidward cries even louder than before, causing the loud noise to become louder; Squidward drops to the ground and Mr. Krabs picks him up] You'd think that Squid would know that we really need to look at some of this stuff! [Squidward slides down again, reaching his hand out] But Squidward, I've got something better to do. [Squidward picks up what is on the tray] I'm gonna open up some of these patties! [takes a tray knob and moves the patties up/down] First one's putrid yellow peel, then old lady want crusty bits... [picks one up and throws away] And finally, the worst of all, is lettuce... [squeezes the patties and sends them flying across the room]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! That's not enough! [opens the door slightly to reveal an entrance labeled "Studio 1", with a cast on the left side by a pipe] Studio 1?
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] Studio 1?!
SpongeBob: No! No, Mr Krabs! No, no, no!
Mr. Krabs: What is it, boy?
SpongeBob: [shouts] I can't hear my clarinet!
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, boy. You just enter in your own whistley-willy.
SpongeBob: Okay! [opens the door to reveal an entrance labeled "Studio 2", with a cast on the right side by a dumpster] Studio 2?!
Mr. Krabs: [no longer angry] What is it, boy?
SpongeBob: [gasps] You can't sing in this song bunk, Krabs! You've got to come with me and my band and get... [The security guard comes running out of the Krusty Krab] ...let's not be picky. [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walking down the street] Let's sing a song, shall we?
Security Guard: All right, who say the n-n-meanest things? [whispering] I'm Dylan and this town ain't got no culture, Krabs.
SpongeBob: Uh, who say the n-n-meanest things?
Mr. Krabs: The n-n-meanest thing is, boy, is this clarinet. [Mr. Krabs corners himself] Hey, I can finally afford this, boy! [He gives SpongeBob the ring] And I know culture, too. [The scene cuts to a wide shot of the Krusty Krab] And
