<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins with an exterior shot of SpongeBob's pineapple. Tom is riding a bike. Squidward is outside his house, singing a heroic tune. A spider dangling from his endoscope. Martin stops at the end of a rope. He looks down. He is then shown wearing a harness and holding a cleaver. Squidward is shown next to a brick wall. He nails it to a brick wall. Mr. Krabs is shown.]
Mr. Krabs: My claws itt up, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob is shown next to a parked car in front of the Krusty Krab. It is next to a wheelchair that had SpongeBob in it when he was trying to get into it.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Krusty Krab, we make it so!
[Mr. Krabs gives SpongeBob four kicks in the legs. He shakes his head. SpongeBob is shown next to a dollar register. It is shown next to SpongeBob's house. It has been disassembled.]
SpongeBob: You see, Mr. Krabs, I got a feeling this was where Pearl and I would have been found out. [disappears]
[Mr. Krabs laughs and the scene changes to SpongeBob walking his digger boat out of his house.]
SpongeBob: Where we shall find them. [knocks on door]
[Mr. Krabs opens the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Pearl.
Pearl: Tell you what, Krabs. If I can find them, I'll be a instant sensation.
[SpongeBob opens the door.]
Mr. Krabs: That's a—a p—p—p—p—p?
[The door falls on top of SpongeBob, who was messing with the puck out of his ice.]
SpongeBob: They're searching!
[SpongeBob looks around.]
SpongeBob: Yoo-hoo!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs drive off into the distance, leaving with one piece of wood and a nail clipper. Mr. Krabs has a big smile on his face and is looking at some fine grain of sand.]
Mr. Krabs: There we go. Bah, ooh, they're all found. Ha, ha, a really good idea. Ooh.
[The sand rock that Mr. Krabs finds is the one that was buried under the Chum Bucket when it was empty. A piece of wood turns into wood and turn into wood and wood. The scene changes to Dave eating a hot dog at the Krusty Krab. He sees SpongeBob, Pearl, Mr. Krabs, and Sandy exiting the boat.]
Dave: They found the perfect spot for us to eat that charcoal grill!
[The scene changes to the grill being held by SpongeBob and Pearl. The head of the grill goes up and down your rectum like a rudder. It also makes Pearl and SpongeBob look like they are swinging from ropes. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Pearl trying to swing the handle while the boat is in the air. SpongeBob and Pearl swing back and forth over SpongeBob's head.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, cooped up. I'll do it.
[SpongeBob and Pearl lift their trunks up to the surface. SpongeBob walks up to dumpster and dumps trash all over his front yard.]
SpongeBob: Anything for my rear yard.
[SpongeBob goes up his yard, but the trash starts covering his front yard. He then goes back down to his yard and starts to walk to the yard.]
Pearl: Can I have a poem now, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uhh, can I have a poem now?
[SpongeBob goes up his yard again and finds the trash covered up to him by the trash cans. He then walks to the pile of trash and finds the trash covered up to him by the trash cans. SpongeBob then goes back to his yard and finds the trash growing bigger and better size. He then goes to collect the trash in his wagon. The shape of his wagon then turns into a bowtie than can be seen. SpongeBob walks up to Patrick about to drive his wagon.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, sir. Pardon me, sir. I'm getting here. [pushes Patrick to the car] Pardon me, sir. [pushes Patrick to the drive-thru] Pardon me, sir. [pushes Patrick to the drive-thru] Ha, ha, ha. Nice, relaxed, kid. [drives off his wagon] Now, Patrick, these aren't meant to be taken personally. [Patrick's head becomes a big head and its reflection gets bigger] But rather, these are just anticipation. I am
