SpongeBob: [turns a light bulb off] Sun never fails, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [turns the light bulb on] Sun... always... brilliant. [lights turn on] Whoo... Sun, brilliant. [Sun shines. SpongeBob turns the light bulb on] Hey, Squidward, this should be pretty easy. [Squidward shuts the light bulb out] Hey, Squidward, this should be no problem at all. Anytime you need a little help, just use this: [Gary puts up a call sign] C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! [the wind blows a piece of cardboard from the wall and puts it on the phone]
Squidward: Hello, Animal Control? No, thanks. I have been trying to call you about this for three days.
SpongeBob: Gary, I really don't want to go, because Sunshiny is gonna destroy any family you've made.
Gary: [meepy phone call] Mr. Krabs, no.
Squidward: [annoyed] No, Mr. Krabs. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! [runs up to Mr. Krabs] What's wrong, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [barges into bed] Ah, what are you doing? The Krusty Krab is no place for a Squidwardite. [night. Squidward is seen sleeping on the floor in SpongeBob's bed]
Squidward: Gary, isn't this great? I got my license and a...happily?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: No, it's not.
SpongeBob: It's about time.
Squidward: Now you're gonna prove it! [slaps SpongeBob, causing him to lose his job]
SpongeBob: I've gotta hand it to you, Squidward. You're always there for me, always ready to have fun. Now won't that help?
Squidward: Yeah. Now go on.
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. [snaps fingers] I promise we'll have fun when you get back.
Squidward: Won't it be great fun, when you get back? Won't it? [SpongeBob gets off]
SpongeBob: Whew, great, Squidward. What's that? [Squidward shoves SpongeBob into his house and Gary gets squished]
SpongeBob: [yelp] great time!
Squidward: What did you do? [SpongeBob gets squished again] Oh, no. Don't worry. I'll get in line.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. [gets squished again] Ow! Oh, no. Don't touch me. Cannot take feather out of my hand. Can't take bad crab hat off. Sorry, I'm too smelly. [gets squished again] Ow! [Squidward slaps himself] Cannot take sand in. [SpongeBob gets squished again] Ow! [Squidward slaps himself] Cannot take straw in. [SpongeBob gets squished again] Ow! [Squidward hits SpongeBob with an umbrella] Ow! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
SpongeBob: How long do you think this line will take...
Squidward: Ten? Maybe? Maybe?
SpongeBob: Whatever it is, we're through. The line's gonna take forever!
Squidward: Now let's go home!
SpongeBob: Aw, we've got to get out of here!
Squidward: I'm not leaving!
SpongeBob: But you guys are pushing too hard! [climbs out of the Chum Bucket] I don't know what's happening, Squidward. I can see. Hmm. [the ground shakes. SpongeBob and Squidward run out]
SpongeBob: Oh, that's very good, Squidward. If I were you, I'd ask you to move back home to live in the comfort of your home.
Squidward: You're it! [jumps on the ground] You're it! Move! [jumps up] Whoo! [he jumps up on the chair and spins it around; he hammers the blanket as he puts the blanket in the ground] Whee! [he laughs]
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward! We're being attacked by a mighty eel that no longer wants to take shelter in my house! [jumps up on the chair] Uh-oh. [Squidward goes into
