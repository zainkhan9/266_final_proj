[The episode starts with Squidward walking home. He puts on his hat and mumbles.]
Squidward: I'm not leaving until I get to work! [Squidward gets home and puts his hat on. But then, his pants start flying.] Ow! [Then, his hat crashes into SpongeBob's eyes, causing him to get hit by SpongeBob's eyes and fall back to the table]
SpongeBob: Huh? [runs over to Squidward] Who-wh?! Whoa! [Squidward gets up and sees that he is flying in mid-air and explodes out of the middle of the floor. Fred is next to him eating a patty with his teeth. Squidward is then shown playing with his teeth.] Hey, Fred!
Fred: Whoa! [screams and runs away]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: Hey, Squidward, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Trying to pass my free dental advice!
Squidward: Oh, no offense, SpongeBob. But I-
SpongeBob: [opens his mouth] What?
Squidward: [holds up his mouth] Mouth wrap.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Tummy lips.
Squidward: [laughs] Tummy lips. You want more?
SpongeBob: [laughs more] Oh, yeah. One for you, please.
Squidward: [tummy lips] Morons.
SpongeBob: [stammering] Garbage.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you alright?
SpongeBob: [gasps] I lost the sale to my toothbrush. [his toothbrush starts to fly and dies] I can never afford that.
Mr. Krabs: No, that won't be mine.
SpongeBob: [gasps] He's rich.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no! Not your old money! [SpongeBob is screaming] At this moment, I'm going to give you a toothpaste maker and a hooder to go home and change.
SpongeBob: I don't have any money, I have to stay inside.
Mr. Krabs: Don't be sad, son. You can borrow some of that fancy machinery. [Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob out of the way] Now.
SpongeBob: Won't that be expensive?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, it won't be cheap. It'll be money I can use to buy someago! [scene cuts to SpongeBob opening the box and getting the toothpaste, hooder, and saw, then walking to the shop] Hey, SpongeBob, can I have some of your rare toothpaste?
SpongeBob: Of course, I have some. The box says I have their sweet toothpaste.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boy! That's the most prized possession I have! Any pirate would have a present worth keeping--buy it, here.
SpongeBob: You're kidding, are you?
Mr. Krabs: Of course, I have a present worth keeping--[holds out a box] for all you rarest of all toothpicks: Your SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Which one already?
Mr. Krabs: One!
SpongeBob: One?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I want you to have my very own, very special, very important, very special, very valuable, very important, very important, very important, very important present worth keeping.
SpongeBob: Goode, good.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, one for you, sir.
SpongeBob: [goes back to his desk] One for me, too.
Mr. Krabs: One for me, too. [knocks on door] One for... SpongeBob? [knocks on the door again] SpongeBob?

D.C. Police Officer: [looking through a microscope] Are you ready to... what?
SpongeBob: Guard... command.
Officer: And how?
SpongeBob: Understand. How do you want me to...?
Officer: Has anyone seen your badge?
SpongeBob: What badge? I don't have a badge. [Officer takes the form and puts it in SpongeBob's hand]
