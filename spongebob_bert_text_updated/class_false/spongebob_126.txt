[The scene changes to Bikini Bottom, the episode begins with live-action footage of icebergs and icebergs caused by icebergs. An iceberg captures the attention of every person on the iceberg screen. SpongeBob and Patrick watch the footage in concert.]
Patrick: Oh, it's beautiful.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Yeah.
[The footage of icebergs and icebergs is shown, revealing that icebergs are actually tartar sauce, a jellyfish jellyfish jellyfloat, and icebergs are plankton jellyfish icebergs. SpongeBob and Patrick both laugh.]
SpongeBob: All right!
Patrick: I know it's creepy, but just because you can't fly doesn't mean you can't deserve to! [chuckles] Hey, it's time to show off your karate chops... Whoo-hoo! [cuts to the First Nautical Bank]
Everyone: Bikini Bottom Fidy Fidy. [They both walk up to her]
SpongeBob: You've got money in your pocket, sir.
Bank Teller: Umm, I'm sorry, sir, but you're no longer the designated takeoff bank see-saw. I think you need a change from the ATM. [SpongeBob takes out his cash register and pulls a penny out of his pocket. It goes back into her ATM and pays for itself. SpongeBob and Patrick sigh.]
Patrick: I changed my mind. I'm now going to ask Sir Gary to shave my beard.
[Gary does it himself and takes a beard out. He takes a beard out and does so with his teeth. SpongeBob and Patrick sigh.]
SpongeBob: I feel so good, I feel good about it. [Patrick lifts his beard and shows it by shaving it] There, there, kid. Okay, kid. [licks the shaving mat and shows it to Gary] You're a beard. [transforms into the ridiculous shape of a skyscraper and laughs] Why, thank you back there, Gary. [takes the shaving mat and sticks it in Gary's forehead] Ha, ha, I'm so very handsome. [laughs]
[Squidward is having a conversation with his pocket fish. He is arranging the money for the trip. Gary has ponytail hair and is wearing a ponytail dance uniform, while Mr. Krabs has eyebrows and make-up on. SpongeBob is making out with Gary through the use of hair curlers. Gary has ponytails and is wearing a ponytail dance uniform, while Mr. Krabs has eyebrows and make-up on. SpongeBob grabs a hair curler and sticks it on Gary's forehead. The hair curler curls Gary's hair and SpongeBob sticks a hair curler on his forehead.]
SpongeBob: Gary, this is getting creepy. [flicks a laser on Gary's face] You just keep seeing stuff like that, Gary. [licks Gary's face for no reason] You're getting all creepy. [gets laser tattooed on his forehead] Ew. Still creepy?
[Gary is having his hair curlers done. SpongeBob pops out of the cutout of Gary's face.]
SpongeBob: Gary, you have to stop being creepiness. It's okay.
Gary: [gets the tattooed Gary on his forehead] Meow.
SpongeBob: [gets an idea Gary] Oh, what kind of creep are you? [Gary is getting his hair curlers done. SpongeBob walks up to Gary and shoves the hair curlers onto his forehead] Okay, Gary, you have to... stop... from... from... From... Anywhere!
[SpongeBob screams and goes to Gary's room. He opens the door, climbs into bed, and falls asleep on it. The next morning, the next morning, SpongeBob walks out of his house to find.]
SpongeBob: What a strange day. [walks into his garden] Sweeeet, it's time to do something silly. [throws a bunch of flowers out and his hearth blows on the wind] ♪My bed's full of wishy flowers. My bed's full of wishy flowers. My bed's full with wishy flowers. My bed's full with wishy flowers.♪ [as he throws the flowers out and into the garden] Whoo-hoo! Flowers!
[Meanwhile, inside Gary's room, it's still notchy and the ceiling has a fungus. Gary himself is still peeking through the holes in his ceiling. His view of the outside reveals lots of green and blue flowers floating in all directions. Gary sniffs the flowers and rubs the fungus off.]
Gary: Meow. [sees the flowers floating in his mouth and his eyes glaze over with the green color] Meow.
SpongeBob: Time to put the flower tips back where
