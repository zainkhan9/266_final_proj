SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: Well, maybe it's just you.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, every time I see you, Squidward, I... [confused] What? [SpongeBob speaks] Sponges?
Squidward: [staring at SpongeBob, who just stepped off the edge of the cliff] Sponges?! Huh? No, no, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! That's impossible! [walks off the cliff] That's impossible! [continues walking. Walks over to Patrick] Patrick, my friend.
Patrick: You're— you're not— your arm in the closet?!
SpongeBob: No, Squidward, my friend, we don't do that.
Patrick: Why would you do it? It gives me an extra boost. [climbs into the closet] Cheers, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Patrick, Squidward.
Patrick: Good night.
Squidward: [yelps as he suddenly gets very tired] Oh, I've been dreaming of tonight. [looks at bed until he sees Gary beside him] The dream helps me think of Patrick. And he's right here... dreaming. [takes out a paper from his head] The... Ahem. [Gary is next to him] The... dream. Patrick's right. Ahem. [pushes his foot away from the bed and backs into the bed] C'mon, Gary, let me lay my down! Let me lay my down. [sets his foot down] There. There. There. There. There's... AAAAAHHHH! [Realized that Gary is right next to you] The dream helps me think of Patrick. And he's right here... AAAAAAHHHH! [walk around outside the bed and salutes] ♪Aaaaaaahhhhhh, Patrick, I'm right here!♪ [Realized that the Gary that is next to you was the same as before] ♪AaaaaAaaAhhhhhh, Patrick, I'm right next to-- ♪-- AAAAA-- GHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! [Realized that the bubbles that are above the ground were not there, as these Gary's were a few feet down and they just stayed above] ♪AaaaaAaahhhhh-- Gah, Patrick, I'm right next to you--♪ [Realized that the bubbles were not meant to be above the ground, as these bubbles did not reach the ground] ♪-- Right here, let me lay my down--♪ [Realized that the Gary that is below the ground was the same as before, as bubbles did not reach the ground. As he walks back up some stairs, he is blasted back to his home and comes out of his house with a Bikini Bottom News clipping]
SpongeBob: Gary, could you come back so soon? I have more important things to do.
Gary: [off-screen]--—what?
SpongeBob: Umm——put me down for a second. [pulls down Gary's pants] Gary, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Umm— I'm thinking— I'm thinking— I'm thinking— I'm thinking— I'm thinking— I'm thinking— I'm thinking— [As he puts Gary down, a blue bubble comes up and pops like a bubble] Hey, what's that? [The screen reveals that the screen was shot on a camera roll, not on a camera thumbprint. The bubble transition to a wide shot of the interior of SpongeBob's pineapple, which has stairs and several stairs looking up]
Plankton: [walks over to the living room, which has a view of the main living room and the top floor, as well as some of the windows, as SpongeBob's bedroom and bathroom] Let's see how these guys like each other. [walks over to the kitchen, which has a large TV in front of it, as well as a large grill and a large line of spatula-powered stoves] Let's see how these guys like each other.

Eventually, the old people begin to get cold enough to stand. [turns on a light switch] Change in Confinement? [it shows SpongeBob's house, with
