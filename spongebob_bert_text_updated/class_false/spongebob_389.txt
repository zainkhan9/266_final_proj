Squidward: Wow! That's the best meal I've ever had!
SpongeBob: Well, thank you for sharing this moment with me, Squidward. But I first need to know, when will this free meal be served to my hungry customers? [shot of family standing in front of the Krusty Krab with Empty Hands]
Squidward: My customers. [starts eating the Krabby Patty] Thank you, Mr. Krabs. I am sure that this free meal will excite their attention and make them eat it up. [his eyes get real hungry as he eats the entire Krabby Patty. Scene cuts to the empty kitchen, SpongeBob is on the stove, mumbling] The formula is missing.

Squidward: Oh, what do I do? [opens the door and all of the people are out by the door]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir?
Squidward: What's all the commotion?
SpongeBob: I'm just here to apply my wisdom to your business. [he hands the formula to Patrick]
