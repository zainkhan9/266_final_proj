[The episode launches with SpongeBob and Patrick about to board an unicycle. The unicycle comes to a quick stop at the Krusty Krab entrance.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I like Krabby Patties! [laughs]
[SpongeBob and Patrick both enjoyed the Krusty Krab Krab Krabby Krabby Krabby.]
Patrick: [off-screen] Wow! Is this restaurant really that good?
[The scene fades to the real Krusty Krab. The Krusty Krab sign flies directly above SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Karen: How could you, SpongeBob?! [the real SpongeBob is still crying and whimpering] You ruined my Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob: [gasps in shock] I ruined your Krabby Patty?! And now my Spongy Pepper Krabby Patty is... [the two patties rip off and SpongeBob panics]
[SpongeBob smashes into the window, knocking the cashier behind away. The window breaks and the patties all over SpongeBob and Patrick land on the ground. They get into a fighting stance each, with SpongeBob landing really hard onto the patties.]
Fred: Hey, where are we going? [points to the ceiling, where there is a hole]
[The two continue to fight. SpongeBob is hitting Patrick with his club, but they collide and knock over several of the patties. SpongeBob grabs Patrick's elbow and swings it in front of his face. SpongeBob bounces off Patrick's elbow and comes up with an idea. He thinks for a second and says "Ger..."]
[SpongeBob kicks open the doors in the middle of the room, drops Patrick on the floor and jumps off of it, rolling around.]
SpongeBob: Ugh. [Patrick lands on the floor] Ow! [Patrick falls into a pile of patties, twisting up some air. SpongeBob thinks for a second and says "What the..."]
[SpongeBob hits on the heart monitor, hitting his foot, nose and mouth. He talks in his thoughts. The scene changes to SpongeBob going to the Krusty Krab with his friends. He goes into the kitchen with a bunch of stuff in hand. He opens the door and gets hit in the head with a barrel.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what happened? [the alarm starts to ring]
[SpongeBob grabs Patrick's arm and whips the ring off it with his hand. He looks around.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
[Patrick shakes his head. The scene changes to SpongeBob going to the dentist with his friend Gary.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, this is so exciting!
Gary: [happy]
[SpongeBob takes the toothbrush and spits it in Gary's mouth. He talks in his mouth a little]
SpongeBob: [pretends to be dentist and gets in the car] Hey, Gary, I have a present for you. [puts the brush in Gary's mouth and drives off]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Do you want to come over and fix it?
Patrick: I'll be delighted to.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob going to the Kru-...]
Patrick's Dentent: Excuse us, gents. Hey, you've got a present for me. [shows a badly made SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Well, I've never seen anything like it.
Patrick: What is it?
SpongeBob: [pretending to sound desperate] It's a... nothingness nothing.
Patrick: What do you mean it isn't?
SpongeBob: [angry] It's a sea star, by the way.
Patrick: Tell me more!
SpongeBob: [looks angry] I have an idea. [shuts the door]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob going to the Kru-...]
SpongeBob: I know everything they do. They call me the kooky one.
Patrick: What does that mean?
SpongeBob: It means it's a sea star!
Patrick: Great. Well, how about you show me some of your science?
SpongeBob: What's this?!
Patrick: What's this?!
SpongeBob: This!
Patrick: That's right. This is the Kru-...]
Patrick: [his mouth rips off] This! [shows a Kra-.......
