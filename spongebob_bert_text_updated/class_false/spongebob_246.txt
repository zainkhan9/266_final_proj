[Episode starts when SpongeBob is shown sleeping and looks at a screen, only see 3's.]
SpongeBob: [into his pillow] Gary! You're on vacation. You can't go out in the cold. [gulps] We're having a good time all right here. But you can't go out in the cold. [slides down his window] How am I supposed to keep the cold?
[SpongeBob starts crying]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I'm so sorry you had any idea I'm a gag newsboy.
[Cuts to SpongeBob in the ordering boat]
SpongeBob: Oh, thanks for doing it, Sandy. It was a good idea before we launched.
Sandy: Well, what was that?
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, Sandy. I couldn't have done it else you'd be complaining. After all, we're having a good time, right?
Sandy: That's nonsense! Having fun is wonderful!
SpongeBob: And what's the worst that can happen? You get eaten!
Sandy: Oh, that's a good one. My leg!
SpongeBob: Hey, glad to be back you? [throws out the sock to get for Sandy]
Sandy: What? What? Trapped? Messed? [Walks on the ground then gets kicked by a Krabby Patty. She then gets kicked by a Vacationist who helps her out her little] Shh. I'm a vacation girl. [she then gets kicked by Gary who is in his bath tub. Dave is in his relaxing room, watching the TV show "Vertigo," and Patrick is walking along with the TV show] And here comes the couch potato, here comes the toy, here comes the hand puppet, here comes the ugly pipsqueak, this is it! [Patrick is about to kick him away when SpongeBob walks up to him] Now you're kicking yourself?
Sandy: [Groaning] That's the worst I've ever heard.
SpongeBob: [Shouting] Out of the shower. [to Patrick] Kick yourself.
Sandy: Well, Patrick, what about those? Well, yeah. They're awful. Why not kick yourself too?
Patrick: Well, what about... [walks off and cuts to a tub with two beds and a shower head]
SpongeBob: [Groaning] In a bed with two beds and a shower head, that's more like it. [to his room] And without a bathtub, that's three baths and a tub. [to Sandy] Say... Sandy!
Sandy: [Groaning] Outta control. [to SpongeBob] What's wrong, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I kick myself.
Sandy: Well, what about what about...
SpongeBob: [To himself] Oh, I kick myself just to make sure you don't get that bath with me.
Sandy: Well, that's not what I wanted to hear yourself say.
Patrick: Uh-oh! [Groans]

Sandy: Patrick, is that true?
Patrick: Uh-oh! [Groans]

[Plankton comes in through the door and runs in]
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy. Pretty hot and dry out.
Sandy: Uh-oh! SpongeBob tried to get me to betray him.
SpongeBob: Well, you fell in, Sandy, you got wedgie fired up.
Sandy: [Gasp] How did you get that plankton- [Bubble transition to Karen]
Karen: Sorry I couldn't hear you, silly. I was trying to listen to some soothing music.
Plankton: Karen, this is terrible! You're gonna have to be... [Opens mouth and gets really angry]
Karen: No you aren't! This is terrible! I paid twenty five dollars for it! You people have ruined my business! [Opens mouth again] You've ruined many a great restaurant's business.
Plankton: Well, you can get over this car.
Karen: Yeah, that's exactly how I feel... [Shocked] ...free!
Plankton: Free?!?!
Sandy: That's what you said you were gonna give up if you tried to kill me business!
Plankton: No, no, no, no, no, no! I'll give up everything! It's just that this isn't worth it!
Sandy: I know what you're saying, SpongeBob. And it's true! I don't want this Krabby Patty to turn into a great big- [Shakes Plankton upside the head] ...rest of
