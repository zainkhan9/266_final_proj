[The episode begins with a storybook entitled, "Atlantean Tales." The book opens and the screens shows images of Atlantean ships sailing through the sky. The screens showed: Captain Scarfish wearing a Atlantis helmet, standing on a paddle ball, and speaking in tongues. He was next to Pearl, who was next to him.]
Pearl: Hey, SpongeBob, what's this? [points to her tongue]
SpongeBob: [his hands are dirty] Come on, Pearl. Don't you want to go jellyfishing?
Pearl: Jelly fishing, huh, SpongeBob? Are you trying to say that I have some of SpongeBob's knowledge?
SpongeBob: Well, I do have some of SpongeBob's knowledge, mister. Let's look at this. [points to Pearl's tongue] This. Isn't there a cliffhanger we can go on? We don't have to go far, considering we have plenty of food. Okay, okay, willing?
Pearl: Great!
SpongeBob: Okay!
[They pulled a rope and Pearl gave SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs the rope. The rope held a cordite spatula that was stuck to a device that was attached to a car. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs began laughing with the spatula. Pearl pulled the car over the car drives off. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs were laughing a little more. Pearl opened the hatch, revealing a large laboratory. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs began laughing a little harder. Pearl opened the lab door, revealing more laboratory. Together, they begin to laugh a little harder. They pull the car over, revealing that the artificial reef is made out of the laboratory. Pearl and SpongeBob stop laughing]
Mr. Krabs: What a setup!
SpongeBob: I can't believe I'm saying this...
[They both pull the car over, revealing that the reef is made out of the laboratory, possibly an artificial reef. The reef is destroyed as they both and Mr. Krabs exit the lab.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm sorry, I...
SpongeBob: For Neptune's sake, Mr. Krabs, open an x-ray!
Mr. Krabs: [exits] Me lab, now! Anything to get you out of this coma!
SpongeBob: Psst, that's not an x-ray, you internal tube, here to haunt you.
[As Mr. Krabs walks away, SpongeBob trips on Mr. Krabs and falls into the laboratory. He then pulls the x-ray with him. It soon turns to night, and Mr. Krabs is walking through the laboratory with a sleeping dummy.]
SpongeBob: Psst, Mr. Krabs. [As he comes out of the x-ray, he gasps] Oh, I will not wake up. [Laughs. Later, at SpongeBob's house, he sees SpongeBob in an x-ray] SpongeBob? What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, is that you?
SpongeBob: [Hearing the horrible news] Oh, it's not that bad! My friends pointed it out!
Patrick: What are you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. Aren't you going to get me, Patrick?
Patrick: Oh, no. Can't we see each other again?
SpongeBob: No way! It looks like your brain's still recovering from a lot of this trauma.
Patrick: What do you mean...
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not going to come back, Patrick. I don't want to make the other ones there again.
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: I'm not good enough. I don't want to start a new life.
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: I'm not good enough to go to the doctor.
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob walking down the road]
SpongeBob: I wonder what Patrick's philosophy is. [walks into the Krusty Krab at the office building. Opens the door for a to be heard from the inside]
Patrick: [Gives a small speech] May I help you, young man?
SpongeBob: I know you wish to go to the doctor, but I have a better idea. [Walks over to a patient]
Patrick: [Gives a small speech] Thy wish is granted.
SpongeBob: A small fee of mine: admission to the hospital. H-at the hospital?
Patrick: Yes, Mr. Star! [Hangs up] My name is Patrick Star and this form will be e-mailed to all of your favorite senior citizens: [She listens intently] SpongeBob, I'm ready for your first
