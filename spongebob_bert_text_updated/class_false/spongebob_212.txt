[Inside SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob is sleeping and Patrick is waking up]
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm awake and you're awake!
SpongeBob: What are you doing, Pat?
Patrick: I'm...I'm tripping...
SpongeBob: Pat, what are you doing?
Patrick: I tripped over this for sixty seconds, and you know what else is stupid?
SpongeBob: What?!
Patrick: I tripped over this for sixty-seventh time!
SpongeBob: Well, I...you know what else is stupid?
Patrick: I mean, you!
SpongeBob: You know what else is stupid?
Patrick: I mean, heck, I think I'm deaf!
[SpongeBob starts shaking and groaning]
SpongeBob: All right, Patrick, that's it! You're going away!
Patrick: I'm not leaving for days.
SpongeBob: But it's early.
Patrick: Early means no sleep.
[SpongeBob slumps then gets up]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I'm not sleeping!
Patrick: [bored] SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob: No, that's me. [snores]
Patrick: [screams] Oh, hello.
[SpongeBob climbs up to Patrick's head.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick.
Patrick: Hello, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob and Patrick fall down into the living room. SpongeBob looks through a hole and sees a SpongeBob with a nose and a nose neither of which are necessary. He gets up and sees what Patrick is looking at.]
Patrick: I am sick of cleaning your face! [screams] I'm going to go crazy and get some sleep.
[SpongeBob imagines his imagination go haywire and he bursts through the wall, sending the two scaredly close their window curtains and causing the two scaredly close Patrick's to fall further into the cold. Both scream.]
Both: Huh?
SpongeBob: [stammering] No!
Both: [continue screaming] I'm going crazy!
[Outside]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow!
SpongeBob: Whoa!
Both: [laugh] Look out, Patrick! [crashes into a bush just as the two scream so loud they freeze and then both get blown back to their original positions] Huh?
Both: [laugh] Dude, you ruined my nights.
Patrick: Yeah.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
Patrick: And you ruined mine.
SpongeBob: And you've ruined theirs too.
Patrick: That's me: My: My: My: My: My: My: My: My: My: My:

[Meanwhile, back at SpongeBob's grandma's house...]
SpongeBob: [guiding by a rock] Keep her safe, Grandma! [Patrick is pushing Grandma's rock]
Grandma: Do not squirt in Grandma's face! [squirts water in her face, breaks the bottle, and squirts ice cream in the air. SpongeBob and Patrick share a good laugh and then see ice cream floats in the air and a circus act member doing flips] Whoa, Patrick.
SpongeBob: Hi there, a guest. Uh, I'm SpongeBob and I must admit I'm a little nervous. I work in a sweet tooth shop, but in the end it's all yours.
Patrick: Oh, I don't get it. Being a little bit nervous can make...you nervous.
[Patrick slams the door in SpongeBob's face and the two fall out of the ice cream parlor. Fun time still follows them like ghostly teenagers.]
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick.
Patrick: And still, a little bit of everything.
SpongeBob: [snoring] I can't believe we've been gone all night.
Patrick: Oh, I sure do. We'll be back, in the bathtub. [breathes heavily]
SpongeBob: We did it, Patrick. Nothing but green!
Patrick: You can do it!
SpongeBob: We just gotta find a place to sleep.
[They walk up a few stairs, but end up in a dark basement.]
Charles: It's not safe out there.
SpongeBob: It's Gulch Island.
Charles: Where?
SpongeBob: This way.
Charles: That way.
SpongeBob: Lemmingsoare.
Charles: That way. That way.
SpongeBob: D'oh! [falls off a cliff, but gets back up
