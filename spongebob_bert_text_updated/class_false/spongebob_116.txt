[The episode begins with a group of strange creatures called sea chimps dancing around inside SpongeBob's pineapple house. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are amazed at the sea chimps' dancing and they all dance around and admire it. The sea chimps' dancing causes Squidward, Patrick, and the house to bounce along and the house to ceiling and wall bounce along with it. Eventually, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward ends up in front of SpongeBob's pineapple].
SpongeBob: Well, that's strange. I thought these chimps from the outside looked like villagers.
Squidward: Yeah, they probably act that way. [SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, isn't that sad?
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: And they're not just any other chimps.
Squidward: Oh, the ordinary means you're a lowly cook.
SpongeBob: Are they ordinary?
Patrick: Oh, no. No. No, they're not.
SpongeBob: And that's wrong.
Patrick: Wouldn't you like me cook some more?
SpongeBob: Yes, please.
Patrick: Thanks. [walks off]
Squidward: They're only ordinary.
SpongeBob: They shouldn't be ordinary.
Patrick: If you were my personal cook, what would you do?
SpongeBob: I would never say that.
Patrick: You're my personal cook?
SpongeBob: [quickly growsl at Patrick] All right, Patrick. Listen up. You're a lowly cook, [swallows] who goes about his business according to his own rules. [starts to laugh] And you rule.
Patrick: [laughs] The old man could cook anything he wanted. He could cook like a potato.
SpongeBob: A potato? No, I mean you can cook like a potato.
Patrick: Well, I can't cook like that.
SpongeBob: Well, I can...
Patrick: ...talk like a potato can. [they continue to laugh]
SpongeBob: [annoyed] What are you laughin' about? You're not supposed to laugh like that!
Patrick: Talk like a potato can!
SpongeBob: Potato can't laugh.
Patrick: Oh, good. Let's go to the park and find some potato fries.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick and I want fries. [walks off]
Squidward: Look. [picks some out] Some are okay. I mean, what else can a fry cook do?
Mr. Krabs: [angry] Why, no, don't tell me. You! [hangs up] Spoons. [SpongeBob doesn't notice] Yeah, you're a dummy. You're not supposed to talk like that.
SpongeBob: Oh, wait. You were.
Patrick: Uhh, um, I was just going to say you were.
SpongeBob: I was just gonna say you were.
Patrick: Oh, don't be so hard on yourself! I was just wondering... [SpongeBob snaps off some of his fins] Ie... where are those maniacs? [Mr. Krabs runs up]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [SpongeBob screams as he is. He goes over to Patrick] Patrick, you see what I'm talking about?
Patrick: Uh, I saw what you did.
Mr. Krabs: Man, what crime did you commit?
Patrick: Uhh, I'm just wondering, because I... Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but, uh, let's take a look, shall we?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, kindly hold out...
SpongeBob: I'm not holding out any more tokens?
Mr. Krabs: Eh, sorry. Tokens?
SpongeBob: Uh, look, Mr. Krabs, we're just gonna take this old dog and his box and, uh, we're gonna put him in one of the guestrooms of...
Mr. Krabs: The Secret Service? Oh, I can't, you're a Secret Service agent.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. [Mr. Krabs pulls out a badge] I'm the head of security here... in the house.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, the Secret Service?! Well, okay. Let's just go talk to Mr Krabs.
SpongeBob: Okay. [starts to walk off] I better get some sleep. [leaves]
