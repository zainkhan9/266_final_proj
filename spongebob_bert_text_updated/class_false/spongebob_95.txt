[The scene shows the exterior of the Krusty Krab. Inside Mr. Krabs office, Squidward is shown sleeping at his desk.]
Squidward: Ooh, this should be nice. [snickers]
[Mr. Krabs is shown sleeping. He is asleep and the lights turn off. SpongeBob is shown sleeping as well.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! How would I like to spend the rest of my days,! [SpongeBob dreams that he is riding in the Krusty Krab and it is full of customers]
Customers: [all talking at once] Nice scenery, if you want it.
SpongeBob: [talking at once] Excellent scenery, if you want it.
Customer: [talking at once] Exciting... if you look at the numbers, it's not that bad.
[Mr. Krabs is shown sleeping. He is awake but then blows on his clarinet]
SpongeBob: [talking at once] Exciting...
Customer: Will you have a parking meter?
Mr. Krabs: [screaming] How dare you steal my mop, I have paid you over a million dollars.
[SpongeBob screams again] How can I have parking in a restaurant?! [gasps] It's for the late people! [later, a parking meter with an "Open for Business" sign is shown. Mr. Krabs gasps] It's for the late people. Get it? Late at night, eh? I mean for the people.
Mr. Krabs: Late at night? [screams] Oh, don't you just love it! This place has survived these events so far.
SpongeBob: Oh, I love it so much, I'm gonna leave early today, that's why. [runs into the Krusty Krab later that night]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I am aghast. Late at night? You're supposed to be coming in early for work.
[SpongeBob's alarm goes off]
Squidward: Oh, I'll never get this job. I'll never make it. I'll never get a raise, get anything ever.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Late at night? You can't work for free!
Squidward: Oh, you're an extreme example. What am I going to do?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'll get a job as much as I can. [runs to his office] SpongeBob, all my eggs, flowers, and hopes are misplaced.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs drive up to the Krusty Krab, but a gust of wind blows by and wipes them out]
Mr. Krabs: Can I give you a present?
SpongeBob: [gives Mr. Krabs' name] Excuse me a present?
Mr. Krabs: Well, you know, since you're a fry cook, you should be getting by with this.
SpongeBob: But, but, but, Mr. Krabs, you already have a license and you can do whatever you want. Just sell it and give it to me.
Mr. Krabs: Sure, anything for you.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: Really, me kitchen's been tearing itself apart. And now, I'm taking this license and putting it on the counter next to me office.
SpongeBob: Oh, what license?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, this is the law. You can't sell stolen property.
SpongeBob:  [gasps] Don't mention it! [as he walks away, Squidward comes by]
Squidward: You can't let this happen to me. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Squidward, can you hear that?!?
Squidward: Oh... yeah. This is the end.
SpongeBob: Oh, good. Or at least, is it?
Squidward: [sarcastically] Really doesn't matter. I'm going out right now. Doing what is right now. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Don't worry. I know another thing. [walks into the Krusty Krab. He exits back into his office. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs] Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. You were saying a little something descriptive. SpongeBob, what happened?
Mr. Krabs: I... um... I mean I said something descriptive.
SpongeBob: I got your number. [gives Mr. Krabs a hat] Please?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I didn't say everything I said.
SpongeBob: Okay. Say, Mr.
