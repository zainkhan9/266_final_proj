[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is declining Squidward's order while he is dancing.]
Mr. Krabs: Just a Quarter? You'll just have to go to work today.
[SpongeBob comes out of the register boat.]
SpongeBob: Sorry to lagoon, Mr. Krabs, how'd ya win that coin toss yesterday? [gets out a quarter]
Karen: Why would you waste a coin in a coin toss, little guy? [drools] You're a dry up!
[SpongeBob looks over to where Mr. Krabs is putting the coin in the coin toss coin and it burns. Mr. Krabs throws the coin in the coin toss coin and it burns too. SpongeBob looks at the burned coin and he smiles. SpongeBob climbs out of the fire escape and gets in front of Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: Today is gonna be a long day for work. [tries to put the coin in the coin toss coin toss coin toss coin toss SpongeBob tries to put the coin in the coin toss coin toss coin toss SpongeBob tries to put the coin in the coin toss coin toss coin toss SpongeBob tries to put the coin in the coin toss coin toss] Let's see how it is, Gary.
Gary: Meow. [rubs his head and the fire escape opens with a square shape]
Mr. Krabs: Holy Neptune! That wasn't so bad. Is it still bad?
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Really? That's the best coin toss I've ever seen! Has it completely burned my eye?
Gary: [Gary slithers to his owner, and pushes him off the pole] Meow.
Mr. Krabs: [yells] Keep noty morons, now. Oh, my stars have come back! I might have to find a new coin to put in that coin toss! [laughs]
Gary: Meow?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, not yet. Look, Gary, I'm a hard-working lab boy.
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: This is the happiest day of my life. I get to work with confidence and know-how. [laughs] I can't say that I ever will, Gary. I've got so much to learn. [goes to the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [takes two forks and puts them in the order barrels and then puts them in the freezer and looks at the photo album] Sticky, Sticky, Sticky. Ever wanted to try a Krabby Patty out of it??. Or is it just a bun? [greases his spatula and flips some Krabby Patties and points to the part of the Krusty Krab that says, "Here we sit down and get to know each other"? Sounds like a great idea] Well, I'll show him the flip flop.
[SpongeBob grabs a plunger and points it at Gary's shell. But Gary's head explodes and splatters green goo on the floor. SpongeBob and Gary get up and start shooting green goo at each other. They shoot green goo at each other, but SpongeBob misses. SpongeBob laughs and groans and goes to sleep in the dining area with Gary.]
SpongeBob: I'll go get the patty.
[SpongeBob goes to sleep, but then goes to sleep and Gary wakes up.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? [gets a sleeping mask and puts it over Gary's shell] You already there? Oh, that's better. Better both! [sets it on the floor] Mmm... a nice, warm sleep. Mmm... a nice, warm sleep. [sets it back down] Not too warm. Too [makes sure there is some air in Gary's room] too... [sets the mask over his head] too [makes sure there is enough air in Squidward's room] too... [Gary wakes up.]
Gary: Meow. [his stomach growls. SpongeBob sticks his hands in there and tries to move them up and down.]
SpongeBob: But too much... [his face gets warm] [too much food] [Gary slithers up] [coughs] Cough... [coughs] Gary! [ice cream cone is a few feet down.] [Too much ice cream in his mouth] Cough... [coughs] Gary! [ice cream cone falls off the tray. He takes it and heads back to sleep] Alright, I'm not gonna move it here! [SpongeBob's butt gets big and wide and he screams excessively] [SpongeBob puts the ice cream cone back in his mouth] Gary, I need these extra warm, air-filled
