TV Announcer: The United States Specializing in...
[The episode launches into the future. An alarm sounds and SpongeBob wakes up with a blank expression on his face. He looks in the mirror to see the look of disgust appear on his face. The scare sound plays while SpongeBob's heartbeat falls. SpongeBob runs into the kitchen to get a cup of water and sits down, SpongeBob then loses his balance and falls down to the floor]
SpongeBob: Whatcha doing? I've got a rough idea: what do you want me to do today?
[The episode launches the episode and starts climbing the wall. The episode launches SpongeBob into the oven and makes him add a single, hot oven apple to the already hot oven. SpongeBob starts to climb down the ramp.]
SpongeBob: How's it going, Ancient Apples?
[The Ancient Apples are shown already at the top of the mountain, called Buccini-Bannon. They are next displayed with their heads stuck through a plate of apple juice. It is as if the episode is going to end just like that episode in which Patrick was playing the guitar.]
Johnny: It's a guitar-jazz show, kind of.
Patrick: Boy, oh boy, would I want to play a show! But, well, let's see what's off the hook. [Patrick strums his guitar. SpongeBob walks up to Patrick.] Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You're sweaty and all over, Patrick. What could be wrong on this occasion? [Patrick gets no closer than Squidward. The episode launches Squidward out of his temporary hiding place.] I shall not be missed! Whosoever may accuse me of sin, I shall surely pay the price. [He points his weapon at Squidward, but Patrick holds him back. Squidward screams and runs away.]
[Patrick walks over to Sandy's treedome. He sees Sandy there.]
Patrick: Sandy, meeeee!
Sandy: [screams] Boo! Boo!
[Sandy gets really angry and teeaches herself.]
Sandy: Boo! Boo! Boo!
[Sandy puts on her helmet and jumps over to look for Patrick. Patrick turns out to be a very upset Patrick's-terrestrial-like self.]
Patrick: Wat, I wonder if I can help you, SpongeBob. [runs off]
SpongeBob: Hey, what's wrong with me? I seem to be lost! [heheh, heh]
Sandy: SpongeBob, it's me, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, now that you mention it, Sandy, I'm a tiny bit crabbed.
Sandy: B-b-but what about...
[Sandy starts to cry. She takes out a broom and sweeps over herself. At that moment, Sandy starts to growl and bark.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Growl] Boo!
[Sandy starts to bark and shed tears.]
Sandy: I...I...I-I feel...m-m-bitbited! [She starts to bark and wail] I'm biting myself.
[She gets Super Weenie Hut Jr.'s (Weenies 1-2) Sandy-bob-bob-bie. SpongeBob and Patrick arrive just as Sandy starts to tear up. SpongeBob takes a soda can and drinks some water. Sandy is now crying a fountain. SpongeBob and Patrick wave to Sandy. Sandy is still crying.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Sandy-bob-bob-brea-brea!
Sandy: Huh?
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy-bob-brea-brea! [Sandy gets angry.]
Sandy: Who's the big brother?!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Sandy's a big brother!
Sandy: Well, that's nice. But I still have a better idea. [the scene shows a telescope pointing towards the Sun]
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh! it's still 0.
Sandy: It's still 0. How'd you get the bright side?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't worry, Sandy-bob-bob-brea-brea. I was just gonna use that one.
Sandy: Oh, no, no, no, no. [the telescope turns back around] It's still 0.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, oh! Whoa! Don't worry! I'll get it!
SpongeBob: [walks off-scene] Hey, Sandy-bob-bob-brea! Where'd you go?
Sandy: I
