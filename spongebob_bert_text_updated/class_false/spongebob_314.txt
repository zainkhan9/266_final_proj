Squidward: [sighs with relief. The camera zooms in on Squidward's home, which now has a lighthouse as a backdrop] All right, Mr. Tentacles, one last special accord. Let's see where this new Squidward is going. Where did he go? Where?
SpongeBob: [in a disguise] I have come to live under his wing.
Squidward: Where?
SpongeBob: under his wing.
Squidward: You mean you want Squidward to stay?
SpongeBob: He has the room.
Squidward: Where?
SpongeBob: under his wing.
Squidward: Can I use your tea?
SpongeBob: Sure.
Squidward: [notices the mirror] Oh! Make room for the bride.
SpongeBob: Yes, ma'am. [shows a bride] The bride will go this instant.
Squidward: Can I use your bathroom?
SpongeBob: Sure.
Squidward: Do you mind if I ask you about his house, doc?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. Great. Let's get outdoors and have a good run. [begins to walk off-screen] But where are we going to stay tonight?
Squidward: Aw, sorry. SpongeBob and I have got to make the drive to this place in-joke. [cut to Mrs. Puff's house, where she is sharing a bed with her husband] I've got to give up the party game. [cut back to Squidward's house, in which he is sharing a Krabby Patty with his wife] Now, this is where we... uh, get sitting.
Mrs. Puff: [House door opens] Hmmm. [SpongeBob makes a Krusty Krab ordering chart] I don't know what to do. I'm not gonna go there for two dollars. How about a mo-
SpongeBob: [Notices a fork in the streetlight] Mm-hmm. I know exactly what you want. That's it. I'm gonna... DIE! [Laughs. Scene cuts to the Chum Bucket, where SpongeBob is wearing a Krusty Krab hat]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, I'm SpongeBob. [Laughs. Door closes] I'm ready. [Laughs. Door closes again] No problem. I'll just need to point you to the Chum Bucket. [Looking left. SpongeBob then pulls his tongue to the right of mine] That's it. [Wrap his tongue around his tongue] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. [Wrap his tongue around his tongue again] Yes, ma'am. I am reaching my eternal audience.
Mrs. Puff: Great. Let me have your way. [Sees a door for a second] Yes... Thank you. [Laughs] Bye. Bye, SpongeBob. [Laughs] Bye, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Don't you go anywhere, lady. [Walks around, singing] Chum Bucket, Chum Bucket, Chum Bucket, Chum Bucket— I love it here. [Licks his face and turns into a frying pan] This chum chum is so good— I'll eat it myself. [Laughs] Ah. [Fiery spatula burns through the chum.]
[Bubble transition to the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob is sweating and drooling]
SpongeBob: I don't know what he's doing here is so— [Laughs. spatula spatters water on him] Oh, hey there, gents.
[Chum in the window rocks SpongeBob and his Chum Bucket hat falls on the ground]
SpongeBob: Hey, what's going on here?
Fred: [Walks on ground] I can't find you. Uh, I think I'll never find you. Look, SpongeBob, this is a very expensive mistake.
SpongeBob: Oh, no I didn't. You were right. This is a very unsanitary place. [Wipes his forehead] I am a health inspector.
Fred: Well, that's cheating.
SpongeBob: No, that's not cheating. Uh, I bought all your chum—
Fred: Pipe down, Squiddy?
Squidward: Flavoring down?
[Bubble transition to Grandma's Rock]
Mrs. Puff: Put your hat on.
Grandma: Okay. Well, SpongeBob, I'm going to get some old hair and drapes it over your nose.
SpongeBob: Ooh, looks like a job for ol' Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Definitely not for me. Oh, wait!
