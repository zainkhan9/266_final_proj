[The episode begins when a dimwit with a welding torch sees to my big bubble. He tries to bend the bubble, but it's too big and it breaks. The bubble floats over to SpongeBob and Squidward, and they both bow.]
Squidward: Whoa!
[The bubblefish then sees the big bubble floating in the middle of the room. He starts yelling into a magnifying glass.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: It's the real BubbleBob![SpongeBob looks at the outhouse, Squidward's eyes widen, he then jumps away.] Why are you two bubbles so small? Do you like me?
SpongeBob: One, two, three, why don't you tell me all the stupid things I need to do quickly?
Squidward: Why don't you two go over[tries to say the least] those stupid things?
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Why don't you two try the stupid things first?
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Wait, that's not what I said!
[SpongeBob and Squidward try the stupid things, but end up failing.]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, we understand.
[SpongeBob and Squidward continue to fail again.]
Squidward: I'm starting to like you.
SpongeBob: Yeah! [laughs]
[SpongeBob and Squidward continue to fail. SpongeBob sees that the bubble is made of a much smaller amount of different stuff and is floating above the real BubbleBob in the middle of the floor.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what is this stuff?
Squidward: It's the stuff that's making the real BubbleBob's job all night. Making BubbleBob's work fun and challenging.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, we've come ages before with your obsession with money.
Squidward: Yes I will dismantle you big bubble and your mother sure would like to get her husband out of your house.
[SpongeBob and Squidward continue to make lots of stuff.]
SpongeBob: You made my job all the more important when you made my husband come play in your dad sandbox.
[SpongeBob and Squidward play with dollar coins.]
Squidward: Thanks â™ª$#$%#%!%#[holds up dollar coins as toys and puts them in his mini-mitts]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. We should be playing with these!
Squidward: Oh sure, let's play a little harder.
[SpongeBob pulls out his toys and he and Patrick start playing with them.]
Patrick: They are so nice!
Squidward: Yeah, don't deny it.
Patrick: They are nice.
SpongeBob: But they're...
[A fork goes through the middle.]
Patrick: They are nice.
Squidward: Okay, let's get back to making these.
[SpongeBob continues to make the other toys and they go further. As he continues to make the final container, Squidward realizes that he is going to pass out worms everywhere.]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody! We're almost here!
[SpongeBob and Patrick stop at the fork. But Patrick gets caught in the spinning grab bag and SpongeBob falls into the funnel. Patrick's jellyfish pockets are shown and he is blasted off.]
Patrick: Wow, I've never seen someone blow their bubbles right out of their bubble hearts.
[SpongeBob continues blowing his bubble hearts to high and low bubbles. He makes a high note with his bubbles, and then he talks.]
French Narrator: The next day...
[The window opens and all of a sudden, the bubble pops. The scene shows BubbleBob outside of the Krusty Krab.]
BubbleBob: Oh, hello, customers. I'm BubbleBob, and I like bubbles.
[All of a sudden, the scene shows SpongeBob on a ladder, above the fry cook's window, above the customers' windows, and above the fry cook's window. BubbleBob then exits from above.]
BubbleBob: Now, where's Squidward? [Squidward is not there.] What are you doing, boy?
[Nothing happens. SpongeBob gasps.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squid.up you.[The scene then shows Squidward sleeping in his bed. He is shown again sleeping and in his bed, BubbleBob is shown there with an ice cream cone in his hand. The ice cream cone lands on Squidward's screen. Squidward starts to snore.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, what is wrong
