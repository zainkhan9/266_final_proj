[In the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is sniffing some money, then looking at it, then putting it back.]
Mr. Krabs: I find this to be very amusing.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Mr. Krabs. Aren't you getting the point across, Mr. Krabs? If you remove the coin, it disintegrates. [pulls coin out and puts it back in his coin bowl then puts it in a vase] That's what happens when a coin gets lost...
[Mr. Krabs puts the coin back in his coin bowl and looks at it. Then he puts another coin in his bowl and puts it back in his bowl, but this time, it gets chewed by a giant cricket.]
Mr. Krabs: That's not cricket! That's a chewed piece of gum! Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace. [laughs then walks off as Mr. Krabs walks out of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: What's going on here, Mr. Krabs?
[Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into coins as he chuckles.]
Mr. Krabs: I thought you were that long gone that was using a coin as a measuring stick... Was it for me?!
SpongeBob: Uh... yeah.
[SpongeBob pulls out a wallet from the wallet and reads the address.]
Mr. Krabs: And in gold are found the rarest jewels, the $100 bill, and I could get...
SpongeBob: Never mind! I'll take a look a little while.
[Mr. Krabs, who is also sleeping, appears and snarls until the wallet falls off. The wallet goes back to SpongeBob as he continues to laugh.]
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs, I got a present for you.
[SpongeBob takes the wallet and takes with him his present including the Times Square cards he got from the Krusty Krab. He walks to the Krusty Krab and takes the keys.]
SpongeBob: My turn.
[The present falls into the bannock and SpongeBob opens the door. The crowd of people is in a frenzy to see the Krabby Patties inside and Mr. Krabs, who is still being chased by pirates, turns into King Neptune and his crab puppet appears.]
King Neptune: There you are.
SpongeBob: I'm King Neptune?
King Neptune: Stealing Krabby Patties! You want money?
SpongeBob: I served my people a Krabby Patty that was double-handedly delicious! [King Neptune screams] Cheese-face! [Checks SpongeBob's present and gasps] Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
[The scene changes to King Neptune about to put some gum on SpongeBob's shell.]
King Neptune: Now, here's where it gets interesting. You asked for it.
[SpongeBob puts a gum on SpongeBob's shell.]
King Neptune: And you held onto it like a king would a king.
SpongeBob: You mean for your own sake, or mine's mine?
King Neptune: Yeah, for your own sake. Well, your present and future generations might as well love it as we do.
SpongeBob: Well, for me, King Neptune, all I really want is for it to live up to its billing.
[SpongeBob gives his mouth a tug on his gum. A vision of King Neptune and SpongeBob appears in SpongeBob's head. In it, the future King Neptune is eating a sandwich as he is in the present. King Neptune sneaks up on SpongeBob and eats him. The vision ends. Legend says that SpongeBob fell into the Chum Bucket and ate all the Krabby Patties. He then dreamed of riding with SpongeBob.]
King Neptune: Let's ride! And let's ride! And a—and a—bon voyage! And a—bon voyage! And a—bon voyage! [descending back up] And a—bon voyage! And a—bon voyage! And a—bon voyage! And a—bon vessel! And a—bon vessel![stretches his chariot and riding it across the street] And a—bon vessel! And a—bon vessel! [SpongeBob drops of water in the Chum Bucket and falls down] Huh?
[SpongeBob's chariot crashes into a shell of a building. Patrick is shown sucking his tongue while riding his chariot. King Neptune is laughing on his chariot while sucking his tongue.]
SpongeBob: [tuckered his eyes] Oh, oh, oh, oh! [screams and runs away]
[SpongeBob drags his shadow puppet figure off the
