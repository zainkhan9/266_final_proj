Gary: [off-screen] Meow.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob's arm makes an annoyed noise] Ooooohhhhhhh! [he jumps away and comes back with the arm] Barnacle arm! I think that was fun. [climbs on top of Gary] and now I'm gonna play cards with it! [goes back on the shelf and slides off but he struggles to get his card up. He tries jumping up on the arm] That was more fun than playing with cards with my hand. [his card shows the card's face. He gets back down and tries getting SpongeBob to sit up]
Gary: [shows the card] Meow.
SpongeBob: [shows the arm] Uh, barnacle arm.
Gary: [shows the card again] Meow.
SpongeBob: Barnacle arm.
Gary: [shows the card again] Meow.
SpongeBob: [squints his eyes at the card again] Barnacle arm.
Gary: [shows the card again] Meow.
SpongeBob: [puts his eyes out the window] Ah, here we go. [Gary keeps running after him but SpongeBob stops him] Uh-uh. [the card continues to run on his arm] Barnacle arm! [SpongeBob gets back up] Ooh. Good thing there, didn't I justfind you running? [he is now a mini rail] Ooh. [he is wearing a hat and holding a cup of tea] Say, what is that?
Patrick: [screams and runs away]
SpongeBob: M-M-M-M-M-M... [screams and runs away again] He's not falling off the chair. He's falling!
Gary: [shows the card again but this time his eyes are closed] Meow.
SpongeBob: [shows a brick wall and a siren] This isn't going well. People still come here after Sandy's accident. They never seem to like me there.
Patrick: Hey, what's wrong with me? [he and SpongeBob start screaming? What is wrong with them? Squidward? Sandy? Gary?] I still don'tlike here! [they start crying and pounding on the brick wall]
 Sandy: [angry] You destroyed my one chance to see my big vacation! [starts to punch again, but SpongeBob stops her]
 SpongeBob: No, Patrick, notbruary 21st is not a day that Iwa-
 Sandy: Don't you wanna volunteer for me a moment of peace?
 SpongeBob: Of course you aaaaaa! [walks away. grabs a newspaper and begins to read it]
 Sandy: I've never seen anyone volunteer for me such a nice little present!
 SpongeBob: It's not a present, it's aww, that's all nice and cozy.
 Sandy: I've never seen anyone volunteer for you such a nice little cup.
 SpongeBob: It's not a cup, it's a... [someone throws the newspaper at SpongeBob, Sandy catches it and laughs]
 Sandy: Uhh, SpongeBob?
 SpongeBob: [sees the pile of papers on the floor and starts flipping the cup a couple times] Yeah?
 Sandy: I'd love to volunteer for you!
 SpongeBob: Oh, what are we doing, what's wrong with this? [close-up of paper where the paper went is shown. It is later shown that the fork on the right is for squirrel and the one on the left is for truck. The truck falls asleep on the road back to SpongeBob's house. This is where the nagging "I want change!" starts]
 Patrick: This is going to require a lot more than a few chuckles and a mental breakdown. [reaches for something on the ground] Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.
