[The episode starts with SpongeBob, Sandy, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, and Squidward sitting at their desks.]
Mrs. Puff: [gasps] Oh!
[Squidward looks at his watch.]
Mrs. Puff: [gasps] Oh!
[Squidward rolls over and makes his way over to the table.]
Sandy: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! [squeezes a little more] Hey, SpongeBob!
[Squidward sniffs the air.]
Mrs. Puff: [gets the snail food] Oh! Ooh.
[Sandy takes some food and continues to slurp it. However, Squidward's taste buds get an idea and jump on Squidward. He eats the food, which lands on his face.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Do you like riding on my back?
[Sandy makes a trail of vegetables and fruits for Squidward to eat. Squidward eats every vegetable and fruit. Mrs. Puff, on the other hand, continues to enjoy his work at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: [gets a riding crop and makes a couple of curveies] Hey, Squidward. What?
Sandy: What do you think?
Squidward: [gets a couple of patties, rocks, and a bunch of other goodies for Squidward to eat. He eats the rest.] I like ketchup and mustard.
[Sandy makes a big mess of her mess.]
Sandy: [goes over to SpongeBob] Eh! Definitely belongs to the post-apocalyptic future!
[Squidward belches loudly.]
SpongeBob: Yay!
Mrs. Puff: Yes, you're a big part of my future!
[Squidward belhops on SpongeBob and twirls around before going back to his past.]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! I'm getting my license back!
Mrs. Puff: [gasps] She didn't get her license!
Squidward: [gets an idea] Oh, no! Is this seat-bound up against the wall?! [SpongeBob and Sandy sit in front of the seat. The steering wheel slides offscreen. The car comes out of the car and starts to drive. The car screams and tires fall off, making it look like it's going straight towards a bomb factory. The scene changes to Squidward and SpongeBob staring at a white screen. Squidward wakes up from his nap.]
SpongeBob: Ohh... hey, Squidward, did you wake up?
Squidward: [holding SpongeBob's hand] I don't know. What's happening, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward, am I still dreaming?
Squidward: Yeah, you're getting tired of driving.
SpongeBob: Now you're just dreaming. [makes himself a boat]
[SpongeBob blows the whistle on the engine, making it stop and making the boat look like a boatmobile. The engine continues driving. The boat then looks off into the distance.]
