SpongeBob: [as the alarm goes off] Time for "And the End Epilogue". This time, I'm going to look at some of the greatest moments of our time. [walks down the hall] Look at all those stories that started a whole world. Look at those stories that started a boat-load of trouble. [walks up to Larry] I didn't start this business any time soon. [Larry looks at a story]
Larry: Your barnacle head story is true.
SpongeBob: That story starts with me bucko brakes. Look at this one. They cost me $300.
Larry: Wow...
SpongeBob: And they didn't stop there. [points at a picture of Harold, it has his head on a fork] Or was it the paint?
Larry: [jib cranks like SpongeBob's] No, this one's painted.
SpongeBob: [jumps into the picture] Naw, this one's broken.
Larry: Nobody started a fire again! So, if this guy wants to start a new one, please, um... [pulls the handle down which makes a new picture and puts up a sign saying "I AM READY"] What is the name of this thing?
SpongeBob: It's me, SpongeBob.
Larry: Well, I just lived through one of those zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie [SpongeBob looks at picture again] How are you gonna keep me off your zombie?

SpongeBob: Well, I'm waiting.
Larry: [pulls out a box of karate gummies] See? It's for you! [takes the gum out of his mouth] No!
SpongeBob: Nooooo!
Mr. Krabs: Relax, boy. You're getting hungry. We want some good, so...

Mr. Krabs: Good-bye. [walks out of the kitchen] This isn't happening. It's not happening!
SpongeBob and Larry: It's not happening! It's not happening! [sobs]
Mr. Krabs: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob: I'm glad you could make it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: We've got a short notice. Please hit the Krusty Krab again. Upsell! [Mr. Krabs charges SpongeBob but SpongeBob struggles to making a Krusty Krab sign]
Larry: But...but how can a crew like you ever earn a living?
Mr. Krabs: The short audition is over. Now fill out this application.
SpongeBob: I do have a few technicalities...[Mr. Krabs hits him over his shoulder but he hands him over] ...but all I can think of is what day of the week I'm gonna get for it.
