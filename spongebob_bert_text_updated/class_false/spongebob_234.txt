SpongeBob: And you're the best fry cook I've ever had!
Mr. Krabs: Done and despatched! [shows up at the compactor with an order in hand]
SpongeBob: So, what do you think? Do you like me?
Mr. Krabs: I thought I could be along Gary's fried foods collection.
SpongeBob: You liked them?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] They're headed straight for that inventory thingy.
[Scene changes to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs at the items on the list]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, these are just too great to ignore!
SpongeBob: Why don't you give them a try? Here, use this! [swipes the spatula but it splatters the sauce on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Get me out of here! [SpongeBob starts to pull and wrestle the spatula, Mr. Krabs arms him with the spatula and tries to get it out, but it's stuck in his throat] Huh?
SpongeBob: Try this! [swipes the spatula but it splatters the sauce on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: Well, this is nasty.
SpongeBob: Try another! [swipes the spatula but it splatters the sauce on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Get me out of here! [SpongeBob starts crying and struggles to get out, the sauce is getting on his face] Oh, oh, oh, it's getting all nasty. [SpongeBob starts choking and squirts out the sauce on the floor]
SpongeBob: Try again! [swipes the spatula but it splatters the sauce on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Get me out of here!
[SpongeBob starts choking and struggles to get out, the window starts to crack, and a mail truck comes out. SpongeBob starts crying, the truck starts shaking. The scene changes to SpongeBob coming home with a package.]
