Narrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Bikini Bottom's premiere daytime eatery. Where it will be closing time right about!
[Scene bubbles over to Mr. Krabs at the register]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] What is going on here?!
[Narrator cuts to SpongeBob reading a newspaper while stuffing his face with food]
SpongeBob: Come on, little buddy, rein it in! [SpongeBob tries to hold back tears, but struggles to do so]
Mr. Krabs: I can't do it! Just stop trying to help me and order some lemonade!
SpongeBob: Oh, lemonade, I gotta order you a dessert.
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen, narrating]... Lemonade. You try? Well, I don't see how that's gonna help me with my tears.
SpongeBob: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! I know! I'll just... I'll just...
Mr. Krabs: Wait, wait, that's it! [Mr. Krabs brings the cash register into the kitchen] Wait! You can't do it! [slams the kitchen door shut with his fist. SpongeBob cheers so loudly that it causes Mr. Krabs to slip on the floor and lie down] Look at me. I'm no longer 6-foot-1, I'm now 6-foot-2, ding dong. [his eyes bug out of his mouth] Ding ding dong. [SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, who is trying to hold his cash register up to the counter] Mr. Krabs, you can't do this! [Mr. Krabs throws it on SpongeBob's head. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, where a sign hangs over the window that says "Closed".]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, the new face of the Krusty Krab, meet the new face of the Krusty Krab, sir.
SpongeBob: [gasps] You're supposed to be ashamed!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm ashamed!
SpongeBob: I'm ashamed?!
Mr. Krabs: Who's the new Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: Me, him, and... me and... me and the boys... meet the new Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: You're not Mr. Krabs me Krabotic!
SpongeBob: You say so, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Why I say so, SpongeBob. What do you want, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: The old Mr. Krabs I used to know.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I like you now. You're come a long way, boy.
SpongeBob: We shall find new lives to call friends in the near future.
Mr. Krabs: That'll be the new Mr. Krabs. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Boy, what are you doing with all my life pictures?! [throws them away]
Mr. Krabs: Take a look. [Mr. Krabs shows a young SpongeBob working a grill in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Hello, Mr. Krabs. Can I use your phone?
Mr. Krabs: Only so long as I live here.
SpongeBob: Once a president, always a runner.
Mr. Krabs: Pretty good, huh? Well, here's the plan. You'll just come back later, sir.
[SpongeBob walks off-screen, leaving the same chair he occupied in. The camera rotates around.]
Mr. Krabs: Now where do I turn? [SpongeBob walks up with an urchin in one of his holes] What the...? [SpongeBob turns around and points to a darker part of the room] Yow! Help! [The urchin gets away. SpongeBob does not look far.] I don't have the money, you know. Can I take you to the Krusty Krab again?
Yoo-Tang! [holds out a secondhand one and laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Yoo-Tang! The first time around, it's not so bad! urchins and suckers are alike.
[The scene changes to show the crowd cheering. SpongeBob is shown at the stand beside Mr. Krabs. The crowd is cheering.]
Crowd: Oooh! [getting even more excited] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Goodness gracious. We've been declared bankrupt.
