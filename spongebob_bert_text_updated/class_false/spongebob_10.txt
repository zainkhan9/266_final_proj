[At the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money, I've got as many as six customers counting his money! [cries]
[SpongeBob is counting money at the Chum Bucket. Another customer, Old Man Jenkins, hears the commotion.]
Old Man Jenkins: [giggles] Krabs! Look out, Mr. Krabs! [counts his money] Ooh, me money! [gives Old Man Jenkins a stamp of authenticity]
Mr. Krabs: Great job, Jenkins! [giggles] Buy some kelp juice?
[Outside the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Jerky sauce? [gasps] Jerky sauce! [gasps] Did you say kelp juice?! [gasps] Mr. Krabs!
Old Man Jenkins: [notices the commotion] Huh? What's this? [gets shocked] How could these old people deal with this old guy?! [whips out his spatula] Can't they see that he's a paying customer? [spins it around and around] Yeow! He's a paying customer.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and Old Man Jenkins trimming kelp. Another Old Man Jenkins comes out of the bathroom.]
Old Man Jenkins: I just wanted some-- [hits Mr. Krabs in the head with the spatula] Oh, excuse me.
Mr. Krabs: [whips out a garden hose] Krabs, you've got to help me mow the lawn! [gives Old Man Jenkins a watering can]
Old Man Jenkins: Krabs, I got to call a customer care. This soil circle's the soil that fell on my foot! [Old Man Jenkins starts watering his lawn]
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins trimming kelp. Another Mr. Krabs comes out of the kitchen.]
Old Man Jenkins: Lawn care. This place sure is top-notch. [holds up a wall of pictures of old people] There ain't nothin' like working at a gallery or exhibiting lost art while my very own art collection is being stolen by... thieves. [sees a dad figure in the living room]
Father Figure: Taking pictures of my prized pendant? [takes the pendant and steals the rest]
Old Man Jenkins: It has been yours, sir.
Father Figure: No more pictures! [throws the pendant away]
[Mr. Krabs is now starting to sweat at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh-ho! Why won't he just give me what I for- [rumbleps] my very existence-- my art!
[Karen is shaving her teeth with Old Man Jenkins' money. Mr. Krabs becomes so mad, he runs through the kitchen and manages to get the camera through the safe it was in. Mr. Krabs gets through to Karen by opening the safe and stealing Mr. Krabs' camera.]
Mr. Krabs: Karen, what's wrong?
Karen: I just wanted to make sure you all heard: That's it. I want you to lock me door.
Mr. Krabs: Karen, I can't give up the arts! What are you gonna do with it all?
Karen: I won't. I got a long career ahead of me of me doing it my own way.
[Later, Mr. Krabs is talking to Karen in his house]
Mr. Krabs: Karen, you're a true artiste. [holds up a mirror] Now here's where it gets interesting. [Pushes the button on the mirror and his reflection appears in the painting] Who's been corrupted by your art?
Karen: That's what they say. [The mirror melts Mr. Krabs and his wife off]
Mr. Krabs: Karen, are you all right? [flushes the toilet] Well? [kisses Karen] Karen?
Karen: My beautiful flower face.
Mr. Krabs: [confused] What happened to the art?
Karen: My husband's art?
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob outside of the Krusty Krab. Karen has placed a 'closed' sign on the restaurant. The cleaning lady comes in.]
Jennifer Millie: And now, the art critic Charles D. W. Jones writes: 'The restaurant is closing permanently.' [The sign says it is closing, but Mr. Krabs has not yet opened his mouth.] Closing is a bad sign.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[Mr. Krabs puts a "no new restaurant" sign on the window. The window closes after about
