[At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is in the kitchen mixing the patties.]
SpongeBob: I mix it up. Perfect!
Squidward: Order #12! Splendid!
[Squidward makes a Krabby Patty for loser. Mr. Krabs is reading a magazine and SpongeBob is in the room writing and laughing. A spatula bounces back from the splat, splattering Mr. Krabs' face.]
SpongeBob: Splendid!
[SpongeBob runs to the fork, forks are falling and chomps down on the patty. Squidward is chattering and is about to write down something.]
Squidward: Something tells me why you're here.
SpongeBob: I can see what you mean, Squidward. [points to a door on top of a pile of boxes that says "Employee"] You're here for the chop!
Squidward: What are you, a robot?
SpongeBob: Oh, I got herlled!
[SpongeBob pulls out a potato chip off of Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Splendid!
[SpongeBob crunches it and puts it in his pocket.]
Squidward: Hey, you've got issue #54, number 52.
SpongeBob: [writes on paper] 55, WHYYYYY? [Squidward's stomach growls]
[SpongeBob pulls up some food off of Squidward's belly button and puts it in his mouth. Squidward's stomach then shrinks and starts growing more massive. SpongeBob traps it in a rope then some more and stuffs it with some more rope. A beam from the top of the Krusty Krab blocks reaching Squidward. Now the sky is clear again.]
SpongeBob: Splendid!
[Squidward continues to grow and then the string starts flying. Bangs and bangs, pictures are taken, and Squidward's body becomes resistant to the growing. To his horrifying surprise, Squidward grows even more.]
Squidward: [growls] Huh?
[The body of the body is shown and it shows Squidward getting worried.]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward, I'm a natural. I've never been one to over-react to...
Body: Oh, no.
[Squidward is shown using his mouth to grow and become huge. He uses it to grab boards for the customers to see. He uses it to make a board of snow for the women to see.]
Body: Oh, dear!
[Squidward growls until body is cooled off. When he is cooled off, SpongeBob and body unite to make a banner for the customers.]
SpongeBob: La, la, la, la, la, la.
Body: Well, there's one more way to spend $15.
[Body1 and SpongeBob gain body as a bunch of customers crowd around each time Squidward is shown wearing a banner. They all cheer for Squidward. SpongeBob puts a big banner on top of the window. Now, when Squidward is shown wearing a banner, body part doubles down on SpongeBob's neck and places it on his forehead. Now, SpongeBob puts a small banner on the window, body part appears to be dangling about]
SpongeBob: I see you did it, Squidward. You put the extra money into me.
Squidward: I was quick to grab the things I could, but the majority wanted me to help them. So I reluctantly acquiesced.
Body: That's right, Squidward. We'll just raise the rent.
Squidward: Oh, yes, I'll take care of the kids.
Body: Yep, definitely will. Thanks, Squidward.
[They walk away. Mr. Krabs is shown outside whistling. Body part takes a hat from one of the customers and squirts it on the ground. It is then put on Squidward's head.]
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Squidward: [growls] Where are those little tyke hands?
Mr. Krabs: [Gives Squidward a piece of his mind] See? And don't come back until you're broke!
Squidward: [growls] I'll make a nice, hot, hot cake.
Mr. Krabs: [Puts a cake on Squidward] Oh, so simple. With my simple, delicious cake, can't go wrong. [Spins the cake on a toaster with the spatula. Everyone begins to eat it. It is done and then the toaster explodes. Everyone eats the cake as well. Squidward screams]
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Squidward: That!
