SpongeBob: [turns off the alarm. The lights turn off as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are shown. Squidward has his head stuck on the hot speaker. The alarm just falls off his head. The scene cuts to Squidward going to his driving range with a load of borrowed parts. SpongeBob points to Patrick]
SpongeBob: We've got the ready to go, Pat. [The scene cuts to the driving range where SpongeBob and Patrick are looking at some cliffs. They notice that the road is rough around the edges and the boat is getting passed gravel. Patrick is back to normal walking straight under SpongeBob and Patrick. The boat passes several cars then they both stop and are about to drive it again. They notice that the boat is starting to get clogged up by the tires. They pass another boat which they hit and are ready to ram it out of the range and into prison property. Patrick bumps into something and then they both ram it into SpongeBob and Patrick, causing a big pile-up on the fence. The boat continues to ram it out of the prison property and into SpongeBob's yard. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run around in circles. They hit and run through and hit and run off and back. Squidward's head is sticking out of his windshield. He pushes SpongeBob and Patrick over to the front of the boat.]
Squidward: Now what are we going to the bath for?
SpongeBob: Well, today I'm a fry cook.
Squidward: You're going to go out of your way to be a...[screams] A fry cook!
SpongeBob: A man's right. [walks in front of the bathtub] To be a fry cook is to be in the soapbox. And...[reads boat license] "To drive a boat." And if I'm careless, I could end up in the slammer. Hey, who's going the boat? [Patrick slams into the brake pedal on the civilian boat] Who?
Patrick: [off-screen] You!
SpongeBob: Who?
Patrick: Me.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both run to the bathtub]
SpongeBob: Come on, let's get bath and make our own soap. [the boat starts to drive away]
Patrick: My boat!
SpongeBob: Whoo! Why don't you ask what it is, Squidward?
Squidward: I want to learn the rules of the road. I don't want any soap at all.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Going somewhere? Hobbling? [SpongeBob and Patrick try to write down the things on the boat.]
Squidward: I want you to start taking your lessons in order. Then we can all share the bath. [to SpongeBob and Patrick] Going to boating school right now?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah.
Squidward: Then we can all chug on bathtub toy.
SpongeBob: [writes on boat] Hey, SpongeBob, how are you doing?
Patrick: [flips toy] Hm. Not bad. Flips toy sure is good.
[SpongeBob starts drinking some bathwater and Patrick takes a sip of it. Patrick starts choking as he realizes his error.]
Squidward: [to SpongeBob] Listen, I'm taking the usual stuff, like the boat for yourself. Out here, I'll be taking you with me to boating school.
[SpongeBob turns on the shower and Patrick goes to gargle up the bath water]
SpongeBob: Are you sure you want to take my bath?
Patrick: No, I'm not sure what to do with my bath water.
SpongeBob: [whistles] There you go, buddy. Over here. Over here. Over here. Over here.
Patrick: Uh, don't you get it? I want to go skiing.
SpongeBob: Oh, why yes we do! We're always skiing up here.
Patrick: Oh, that's right. Snowboarding! [shakes his rock]
SpongeBob: Whoo, we got space suits, space suits, ready for assignment 74!
Patrick: Okay, 74, 74!
SpongeBob: All right, 74! [shoots a suit through the window and hits Patrick on the head]
Patrick: Oh, oh, head injuries!
SpongeBob: Who, 74?!
[cuts to outside]
Patrick: I got mine down, I'm a deceiver!
SpongeBob: [whispers] Space suits, space suits, space suits...
Patrick: What are space suits and what are space suits? What's the difference?! [SpongeBob starts crying and cries on either side of Patrick
