<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins on a dark and stormy night. Lightning strikes Cactuar, Bikini Bottom,.[1] The sea bears are upon it, and they are not happy.]
Bully #1: Stop, you traitors! What was that noise?
[A Stormy Night! Sailor's Diary] While the citizens were upon it, a beast appeared and its image came to life. It was not the citizens, but an extremely shifty sea fiend, who was frightening the citizens with his horrible screams. [The Kraken appears] The Loch Ness Monster!
[Loch Ness Monster screams]
Sailor #1: Wha-ha?
Sandy: "Loch Ness Monster?"
[Loch Ness Monster laughs]
Sandy: "Loch Ness Monster?"That's a good one, SpongeBob. That's a great one. Well, I think we have a new friend here for you.
[A Creepy Cat! appears]
Sandy: It's a creepy cat?
Scarecrow: Why, my squirrel uncle snitch on me.
Sandy: Well, now are you going to get me back to Atlantis or did you shrink me to little Byngrams?
Scarecrow: Stay where you are, Sandy. I can't take any more of your dirty, old tricks.
Sandy: I'm not taking your dirty tricks anymore. I'm callin' Mr. Worms! [Mr. Worms comes to life]
Mr. Worms: What are you doing out here?
Sandy: [He is shown being carried by Mr. Worms] I'm an astronaut. I fly space!
Mr. Worms: Messy cats, drop a pirate on a schooner, it's space time!
[Mr. Worms cries and Sandy lets her cat bounce it up and down in the air. Mr. Worms hits her harder]
Sandy: It's time to kick his butt! [SpongeBob is shown having his butt taken care of]
SpongeBob: Sandy, I need to have another opinion on this.
Sandy: Mister, what do you think?
Pirate: Me?
SpongeBob: Sandy, don't you think I'd kick his butt?
Sandy: What do you mean?
Pirate: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: Well, I think I'd kick his butt. But, you know what? We could get so worked up over here. [SpongeBob knocks on Patrick's rock]
Patrick: Hey!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, we'll turn this into a role-playing game. [opens the rock. There is a blank, blank canvas] WHAT!? What do they know about playing with light?!
Patrick: I don't care! What do they know all about playing with light?! [throws the rock. Sandy gasps] AHHHHH!!!! [puts the rock on the edge of the rock and stands up] That's it! That's the role playing I'm capable of. And I'm ready! [looks at her] WHAT!?
SpongeBob: Sandy, I saw what was in Sandy's helmet!
Sandy: What? What did you see? I didn't even know you existed!
SpongeBob: Sandy Cheeks. She calls you "Sandi Bing."
Sandy: Well, that's more like it. I was just reaching for something else to have in my pocket.
SpongeBob: Hey! I see you've got the thing strapped to your back.
Sandy: That's it. That's my back. I'm just being a little abstract.
SpongeBob: [walks out of the rock] Uh-oh! I want to see a Sandy!
Patrick: Look, Sandy! You can come with me or against her... Hey!
SpongeBob: Who's that?
Patrick: Who are you, buddy?
SpongeBob: I'm Patrick and Sandy Cheeks.
Patrick: Gee, it is great to finally meet you!
SpongeBob: It's funny, Sandy, you used to be my best friend.
Sandy: Well, why don't you get a license? It's illegal.
SpongeBob: Okay, buddy. Hi-yah! [starts walking away, but Patrick whacks him with a shoe] You got a license. [takes SpongeBob with a shoe] Well, now I'm the idiot that turned off the light.
Patrick: I'm getting licenses... but how do I even get a license?
SpongeBob: I applied for one. I was the idiot that turned on the light. That's all there is to it, right?
Patrick: I'll show you how to get a
