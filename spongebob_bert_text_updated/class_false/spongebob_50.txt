[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick skipping down the path with an orange balloon. They make their way to a spotlight. SpongeBob shines. Then, lightning strikes, and SpongeBob's balloon forms into a colorful tornado. The balloon tornado sprays water in SpongeBob's body, making him sick. SpongeBob bounces back and forth and makes a few clumsy zig-zag jumps. Then he jumps back to his original spot.]
Patrick: Huh? [The last of SpongeBob's leaves]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [A few leaves separate SpongeBob and Patrick. He turns to Patrick] You two sure are friends.
Patrick: I can prove it! [He pulls out a golf club]
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. But we should go get something to eat.
Patrick: Give me a golf club? [SpongeBob gives Patrick a thumbs-up]
Both: Okay. [Patrick points to the greenish color]
Patrick: That's it! I've got to get some life to stay alive with this yellow weather! D'oh! [The balloon zaps them. The scene cuts to the tree house where the three are still going on.] We did it! We got rid of the carnivorous critter, and now we can eat him just like a good good good good good good old farm boy. Hey, what's that? [A magic carpet shows a photo montage of Patrick]
Patrick: [in a trance] How the heck did ya down here?
Both: It's funny, man, his mommy told us to "go."
Patrick: And to old times.
SpongeBob: [snoring as the leaves in his pineapple dance behind him] Huh, good old pineapple. They're back!
Both: Up, up, up, up.
[The leaves turn into stars]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughing as they open the leaf blower in the tree house. The leaves turn into stars. They are climbing back up the chimney and back up the survival telescope. The scene cuts to the island, where Squidward is continuing his sleep as a leaf blower starts to burn him. The scene cuts to SpongeBob outside the Krusty Krab after getting caught in a roadside minefield.]
SpongeBob: Good morning Mr. Krabs, [SpongeBob sheds a tear] and a can of snail-nip may be about to hit you.
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] Is it a what?
[His eyes pop out as a hot air balloon blows by]
SpongeBob: A can of snail-nip. [SpongeBob gets an air helmet and starts riding the air pump, he screams, and falls off the cliff outside as the rest of the family runs by]
Gus and Horace: For lunch!
SpongeBob: I'm glad you found a new life. Well, if you don't, then I'm afraid our precious shrub-squeak song will become part of the song that you want to keep, [SpongeBob begins again, and this time his nose is blinded by the air pump] and tissue donation will follow.
Hans: Why, hello, gentlemen. My name is Hans Yousef here at the Krusty Krab. I love you very much.
[Mr. Krabs runs over to the Krusty Krab, and Mr. Krabs opens the door, to let SpongeBob in.]
SpongeBob: Oh, welcome back, Mr. Krabs. Why don't you step in the kitchen and try our delicious Krabby Patties? It's time to get serious.
[Mr. Krabs leans over him, and smiles.]
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, sir. Come on, let's get busy. Four is the right size.
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's house, with mustard and buns everywhere, and a fireman coming out of the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: Now, now, I'm not talking about me being shy around here, me character in the show, [Mr. Krabs puts on a business suit] me voice again. [The fireman comes back out again.]
Narrator: Six hours later...
[SpongeBob is still crying, and Mr. Krabs places his order in the kitchen. Inside, Plankton is sleeping in his bed, due to the kindness kindness kindness kindness kindness kindness kindness kindness. Plankton turns towards the window and sees SpongeBob crying.]
Plankton: No, no, no, no, no! I know everyone does it. It's too brutal. They just order the meal there.
[Suddenly, the window rings a bell, and SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs rush out crying. Mr. Kr
