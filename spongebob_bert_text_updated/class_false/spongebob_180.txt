[The episode begins with Patrick sleeping until his rock opens up and the sun sets in the distance.]
Narrator: Ah, the sunrise. Hates it so much. [Patrick's dream sequence begins with a bus dropping off Patrick and it then shows a beach. Patrick then starts walking down the road. SpongeBob giggles and Patrick rips open his shirt to look for SpongeBob's pineapple] Sigh—the beach's so nice. [SpongeBob walks up to a bald eagle that looks like Gary.] The bald eagle roars at the witless—the witless takes a bite out of the cane he's carrying [Gary bites SpongeBob]. The bald eagle sheds a tear, then hops up at the thought of going hungry. The next scene shows a sunset with children. The president of the children's club gathers them.]
Nat Peterson: Are you gonna— [Kids run into the sunset.] Oh!
[Nat Peterson snaps his fingers and kicks his chair away. The children pause for a moment and sigh.]
Billy: [holding a banana] Thank you.
[Kids quickly run off as the adults continue to gather around playing cards and rock music. As the children continue to stare at the sun, their eyes stretch out onto SpongeBob's pineapple and into his stomach. SpongeBob sheds a tear.]
Nat Peterson: [sheds a tear and takes off his rock] Oh!
[Nat walks up to Patrick.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
[Patrick grabs SpongeBob, places him under the rock, and pulls his nose into place.]
Patrick: [screams] Run!
SpongeBob: [runs] Oh!
Patrick: [runs] Oh!
SpongeBob: [runs] Ooh! [runs] Ooh!
Patrick: [runs] Ooh!
SpongeBob: [runs] Ooh!
Patrick: [falls on the ground] Ooh!
[Patrick falls into the water. A rainbow was once again revealed. The ground shakes and SpongeBob comes out of a rock.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! Re—re—re—ree—ow. [SpongeBob falls under the rock, gets up and comes out 'half' feeling completely flat. He lands on the ground and gets crushed. He then gets up and sulks away; SpongeBob's squashed remains are seen twitching and a crust. A green odor washes over SpongeBob and a smelly Gary appears. SpongeBob starts sweating and groans in fury. Cut to the inside of Patrick's bedroom. SpongeBob wakes up and looks outside. He sees a toothpie clawing a hole in the wall. He jumps out and comes out with a purple rash on his forehead]
SpongeBob: Oh—ah! I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it! [His left toothpie faces Patrick and it makes squeaky noises.]
Patrick: Oh! [Squidward's window cracks SpongeBob out] Squidward!
[Patrick comes in with SpongeBob as his pupil squishes up into a look of fright. He nudges SpongeBob a little and SpongeBob a little more and Patrick almost runs off.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
[SpongeBob struggles to get SpongeBob off his head, gets off his foot, and runs off. Patrick is about to punch SpongeBob in the face sends him flying over to the table and hitting Squidward. The only people standing in front of were Mr. Krabs and Plankton. Squidward: Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Plankton, I was just putting food on the table. [Plankton grabs Squidward's chin]
Squidward: What's the matter?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know what you're doing, Plankton. This isn't right. This is repugnant. I demand answers! [He walks off and gets himself knitted again] You're behind bars! [Mr. Krabs stops walking] But that doesn't mean this isn't a joke Squidward. [Jumps up and down] I can sleep with a Chum Burger for under 25 bucks. [Sleeps though and wakes up by the time he was told that he had swollen to full size] And I said 20 more bucks. [He takes his money and leaves. Now Krabs looks like a creep]
Mr. Krabs: Of course you are. This is your regular chap, Plankton. Put me down already.
Plankton: You'll never thank me, Krabs, not after you tattled on me.
Mr. Krabs: [Slaps Plankton] What the... What are you talking about?
Plankton: [Alarmed] What are you talking of? You ruined my last breath.
Mr. Kr
