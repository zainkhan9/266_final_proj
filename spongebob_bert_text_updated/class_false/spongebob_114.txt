SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, how are you doing?
Patrick: Sleeping, outta sorts.
SpongeBob: [whispers DBUs] Sit down, I'm not paying you to sit in seats in traffic. [they lower Squidward down and Patrick to his seat, then they start to ride on the other side of the road]
Patrick: TWO DBUs! [other side of the road now has bump on it and it collapses] Quitter!
SpongeBob: [whispers DBUs] Drop your rims, guys. [both ride off and return to their original positions] That's all we got here. Ooh, we were down here too. Well, if that's the last we have to visit... [notices road] Oh. Gonna rain disaster on the poor folks. [gets out a bag of food] You're a lucky bunch.
Patrick: What's a disaster?
SpongeBob: That we're a bunch of lambs.
Patrick: We're not lucky?
SpongeBob: Well, let's get out of here. [both run off and run after Squidward]
Squidward: I have to go to work. [gets in some more mud] I'll show them. [slams the door down and shows a mud puddle on the floor] Why are workers covered in mud?
[SpongeBob and Patrick get up and run to work. SpongeBob looks shocked.]
SpongeBob: Hire a professional masticate and hoist the bag over your head.
Patrick: Wouldn't that be great?
SpongeBob: See you later, Patrick. [later, SpongeBob is in his work pants] Happy work! [sadly] Dressed up. [cuts to Squidward in his house digging a hole with SpongeBob and Patrick as his house]
Squidward: Ow.
SpongeBob: [angrily] And the best part is, you're not wearing any pants. [gasps] You said that?
Patrick: Yes! Pants! What the heck is that?!

[SpongeBob smells the dumpster, smells the dumpster, goes to look, but they turn their backs and go back. The dumpster moves and pops.]
Patrick: It's not working!
SpongeBob: Well, the name's SpongeBob SquarePants. Well, we're gonna demand entrance into the dumpster to return SpongeBob's skinny dipping to normal.
Patrick: I've had a good laugh over the phone.
