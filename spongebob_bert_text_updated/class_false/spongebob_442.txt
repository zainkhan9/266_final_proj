[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick skipping down the hall.]
SpongeBob: Boy, I'm glad I passed The Fresh Airboard.
Patrick: We've done it! We can do this all again!
[Suddenly, the door to the upstairs swimming pool opens and a huge crowd emerges. Patrick and SpongeBob appear and rush in. SpongeBob laughs evilly and everyone in the swimming pool runs towards SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob even jumps in front of Patrick. Everyone cheers and gives him a medal for his hard work. SpongeBob nods to all the people who voted him into the audience. He gets to the kitchen, where an angry mob forms around SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Not the people, I'm the Fresh Air Board president!
[SpongeBob runs onto the stage and gives Patrick a thumbs up.]
Patrick: Hooray!
SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick's nose and his face turns purple] I'm the president of the 21st annual swimming pool! I'm sick of cleaning! sick of cleaning the floor! [He shows up at the door of the swimming pool, with several other competitors including a limping Patrick beside him] How about you guys join us for a once in a lifetime opportunity to see the greatest swimmer in the world!
[Patrick opens the curtains and reveals an enormous green jockstrap tied with lambrous!]
Patrick: Come on down to the Krusty Krab and get your filth back!
SpongeBob: [takes Patrick's glass] Here you go.
[SpongeBob and Patrick dive into the kitchen. They sit on a plate, take orders, and watch the spectacular swimmer do his thing. But the most heart-wrenching part about the whole experience is when Mr. Krabs tried to pull down a single arrow from each of the other fingers. It was so excruciating that customers began appearing outside the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's all the hubble? Customers?
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: I think that you're offering me your fourth concessionaire. [points to the dollar that is on top of his head] See? It's not for sale.
Squidward: Uh-huh, your concessionaire is just a billboard.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it is not a billboard! It's for sale?! [Squidward jumps up onto the table and sticks his tongue out, showing that he does not like the advertisement and looks away] No way, Squidward. I see you're trying to pull down a arrow.
Squidward: Hmm. Well, I don't see how that can be any worse than shooting stuff! [Squidward looks at an arrow-shaped billboard]
Mr. Krabs: I don't think so!
[Mr. Krabs and the crowd surrounding Squidward are throwing roses and holding balloons. A fish comes in being an artist]
Tina: Oh, you're it.
[Two fish look at each other and pick their nose veins to make a bloodshot look. An old fish is walking towards Nat Peterson with a banana peel in his mouth]
Nat Peterson: Oh, don't you have anything to say about that? [eats the banana peel and walks away]
Mr. Krabs: [screams] No! I've got what I think is a broken nose.
Squidward: Well, I don't have anything to say about that! [jumps onto the stage and performs a number]
Mr. Krabs: [crying] It's as if everything that makes the Krusty Krab tick is missing now! [slams his face into the glass] Because we're being sold out! Because it's a fraud! [slams his face onto the stage again] This is a ruined city!
Squidward: Oh... I like being cheated. [looks at the destroyed city] Oh, what have I done? [cries and runs away crying] I'm going to make it all right, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs stops crying and turns around and gives Mr. Krabs a piece of his mind] This is better. [walks away]
Mr. Krabs: Eugene Krabs? [Mr. Krabs mind briefly blankly and he picks up the broken pieces of his former city and his own city here on Employee Island.] I could make this work. [jumps on top of the destroyed city] Like a strong man needs a wife and a mother.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab with a vision of the future.]
SpongeBob: Are you ready for the big city? / Welcome to Krusty Krab, where the next big thing comes to the
