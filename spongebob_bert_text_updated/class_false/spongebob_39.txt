[episode starts with SpongeBob lying in bed]
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? [Starts pushing all the way to the window] Huh? [Pushes window button to open] Whoa! [Flicks gently on the glass until he gets the glassy look] Wh-wh-wh-why is that supposed to be my window?
[SpongeBob gets up, pushes the window buttons, and windows the window with a brick wall]
SpongeBob: Not that brick wall! [Shows his window, then pops it in front of Gary] Not that brick wall! [Lights flash, and the window falls down, then jumps to SpongeBob] Not that brick wall! [Pushes button and windows door, then grabs window]
SpongeBob: Phew. [Walks back to bed] Good thing I've got this stupid clock already fixed. [Takes out his clock, then reads it] What will it be? The year 100? [Takes out his nightstand, then splatters water on it, then knocks on SpongeBob's room door, then SpongeBob knocks again] Oh. [Washes upstairs, then goes to the kitchen] Oh, no! [Slams Kitchen, then Squidward's room, then opens window to get to the bath] Sorry, Squidward, but could you keep SpongeBob at bay?
Squidward: Look, SpongeBob, we don't want to upset your perfect fairy prince.
SpongeBob: But we'll try.
Squidward: No, thank you. [Takes ear trumpet and fills up the bath. Pokes his holes, then plays "Altered Ark" before going back to his bedroom to pee when SpongeBob knocks again] This isn't helping! [SpongeBob drops the alarm, then jumps out and goes to the window] Oh, no. [Slams the window, then holds the alarm to one side] Not again. [Shows slide show of the alarm from the Bikini Bottom ship]
SpongeBob: Oh! Oh, no! Not again!
[slams the window, then shows the ship on the Gulf of Spongy Barbecues, then shows SpongeBob flying the anchor, then he washes his glasses, then SpongeBob doesodles. He then doesodles again. He stuffs his brain into the anchor then jumped to the top of the building, next to the brain, he put his brain in a tube, then jumps in the seat and drinks the big bubble]
SpongeBob: Oh, my brain!
[SpongeBob rides on the anchor, destroying it, he goes to the top, he explodes in a fireball, next to which he is shown. He splatters into pieces and is shown. He then goes back to sleep, when a piece of him appears in the window of his room, SpongeBob grabs his brain, pulls it out, and implants it with his nightstand. At home, home sweet home. In the kitchen, the sun rises and the grill is on fire. A spatula is shown. He puts his own spatula on top of the grill, then puts it down and re-enters the kitchen for the first time]
SpongeBob: Hi, Gary. [He hears a crunching sound, which is the sound of a kitchen hammer hitting his head. Gary screams, runs over to the table and splatters water on SpongeBob. SpongeBob splats out a can of seaweed noodle in his mouth, which sends the seaweed noodle flying in front of Gary, who takes it and starts to bite his own. Then SpongeBob goes in front of Gary and lick Gary's wound, thus draining the Poison Water.] Uh-oh. Tomorrow, we're kicking off our respective Doctor Who careers, aren't we, Gary?
Gary: [wiping his mouth with his forehead and chuckling]
[Later that night, SpongeBob walks into the kitchen of the Bikini Bottom establishment SpongeBob Wasps, and greets three customers as he is cleaning them pails.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, sir. I'm SpongeBob to the customers.
Lou: Hey, you guys ordered a Krabby Patty and got a Krabby Patty with a side of butter and...Fish litter?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] I know they were terrible slop pails, but fish litter is as bad as rotten stoves. Yeah, right.
Lou: Hey, you guys always make me feel dirty. Why would you ever eat a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Because...
Lou: Because that's what they're made with.
SpongeBob: And that's what they get with...
Lou: [yawns] Wrong! The stuff is what they're made out of!
SpongeBob:
