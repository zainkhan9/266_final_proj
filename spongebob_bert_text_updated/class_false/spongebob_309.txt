[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is once again busy using the hook in a fishing rod to get SpongeBob's hook.]
Mr. Krabs: Hold that thought, SpongeBob. I will finally get that formula!
[SpongeBob pops out of Mr. Krabs' arms.]
SpongeBob: Uh-oh.
Mr. Krabs: Now that's what I call a true gentleman's work.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Hey, Squidward, nice day ever so? Where's your fry cook?
[SpongeBob looks behind him to see where his frying rod is.]
Squidward: The hook! I've never seen such a thing! Out of the blue, tell him I'll fire him!
SpongeBob: Out of the blue, sir?
Mr. Krabs: [outraged] Why can't you just let me off?! [shouts] Tell him you'll fire him!?!
[SpongeBob runs away, but Mr. Krabs is waiting for him.twithered up. Then he stops and he looks back. He has a look of guilt crossed towards him.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm sorry, boy! That was rude. Now he's going to have to treat me like a responsible adult. Oh, boy! I love you even more than I used to. [takes out a pen] A pencil.
SpongeBob: A pen? And what's that do? [tears up] Oh!
[Mr. Krabs throws the pencil into SpongeBob's mouth. SpongeBob chases after it. Mr. Krabs finds it on Treasure Island, and Mr. Krabs chases after it as well.]
Mr. Krabs: There ya go! Have a nice day!
[Mr. Krabs runs off, and SpongeBob chases after him. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob chases after one of the hooks on a fishing pole. They are joined by a civilian who looks like Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: I'll be waitingin'!
[They both look through the chain linked hooks, and see Shiny Shiny Jellyfish Jellyfish holding a net. He closes the net and a sobbing SpongeBob hides behind him. The scene changes to them walking up to a potty tower in the lighthouse.]
SpongeBob: [from outside] Sir, I'm stuck here. Please meet me at the front door. [enters the tower but then is kicked to the back by Shiny] Shiny, you're here! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cross the street to get to the Krusty Krab?
[Shiny Krab sign flies over his head, and he faints from exhaustion. SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Mr. Krabs get their food.]
Mr. Krabs: Quit your exhaustion drive and check back.
[SpongeBob pulls Shiny Krab security guard Kelpy K. out of his body.]
Mr. Krabs: You want to go over there and try for it, please?
[Shiny Krab employee Gus is offended by this, and runs away. Mr. Krabs follows him. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs both sit on the other side of Shiny K. Shiny sighs. [as he is inside, Shiny growls.]
SpongeBob: Shiny, don't inside.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, this is the most elaborate scheme ever.
SpongeBob: How did you know I'm the only one with hooks in my tail?
Mr. Krabs: Well, you might say. The whole point of getting a hook in your tail was to get you as a paying customer.
SpongeBob: So it's all the more impressive that you gave me the green light, right Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I chimed in when you were: "I like paying customers, SpongeBob." [imitates Mr. Krabs]
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob at the Chum Bucket. They are both humming together.]
Mr. Krabs: So you thought you could lure customers into moving old people eat into the long hall.
SpongeBob: Old people eat long hall.
Mr. Krabs: That's what they eat.
SpongeBob: And what a place like Eugene - a hall of thieves and thieves here at the Chum Bucket. So many lives in confusion.
Mr. Krabs: Too bad Old people eat all the hall.com.
SpongeBob: [moaning] They eat all the hall.com!
Mr. Krabs: So, you're not coming down?
SpongeBob: Of course I'm not coming
