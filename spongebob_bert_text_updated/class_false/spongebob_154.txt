[The episode starts when a bus drives on a cliffhanger, going up to a house. The house is tilted 90 degrees left. The house bounces up and down before coming to rest]
Narrator: Later...
[episode starts at the Krusty Krab] 
Narrator: Welcome to The Krusty Krab, a special $5.00 discount code is applied to your order that is shipped. Available to Eats members only. Does not apply to other customers. Does not apply to pay. Do not apply to order. Does not apply to any other discount codes. Notices a coupon for $2.00 that applies to the home office. The employee snaps, and the coupon disappears. The house falls into the yard and splatters water on the lawn, breaking the legs of one of the house's crew. The runner-up hat dollar bill does not have water in it, however. The runner up dollar bill has glass windows that open and close, which is a sign that your house is Empty-Empty. Mr. Krabs is washing the roof when he notices the Empty-Empty flag.]
Mr. Krabs: What the barnacles is that? [SpongeBob walks up] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh, this is the flag. [SpongeBob takes the empty spot and goes back up the stairs] I just finished making Krabby Patties for you.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, a Krabby Patty is as good as an Empty Head! [Laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, maybe you can give me a little something of my Empty Headness.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I can't take anymore. Please tell me the truth! I'm a wreck without you! [Holds up Empty-Head papers] I miss you more than you deserve! [Holds up Empty-Head scarves] You're just the thing.
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Krabs. I've had my chance and I've tried. I've tried. I've tried. I've tried!
Mr. Krabs: You bet we're gonna lose our job and your house. Are you gonna come with me? [Mr. Krabs hangs up]
SpongeBob: No way. We're still hired. In fact, we'll be closing down our business in little minutes. We just need someone to blow out the candles and blow out the candles fire.
Mr. Krabs: You wanna blow out the candles then?Cause I'm a candle-wasting... [Opens doors and then closes the one hand on the Krabs coat hanger] Ooh, cheap time! [Shows all the candles off like lights. Then he slowly opens the door to reveal Gary]
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: Good day, ladies! [licks the handle and then the OFF switch turns on] That's okay, it's just that I'm close to work and home. Oh, I'm always going to blow out the candles.
SpongeBob: But, but...
Mr. Krabs: You just let me do all the fun. You know, something really important to you. Maybe a partner.
SpongeBob: [horrified] NO! I don't deserve to be hated! Don't get it twisted, don't get it worked up, don't get it worked up, Mr. Krabs!
[SpongeBob runs away]
Mr. Krabs: What is it, young man?
SpongeBob: [suspicious] Can I have a raise?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: [calmly] Okay.
Mr. Krabs: ...and... [As he says this, healken people up to him]
SpongeBob: I guess you're not a hot seller, I see.
Mr. Krabs: Quit saying that. Look ya. I was just gonna break your shell.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, I didn't think you could be this cheap! [Everyone looks at him like he's scaring them. Later, he is talking to himself] I'm going to break it out of them. [goes into a graveyard] I'm going to make it up to you. [looks at his tombstone and gets stoned] I'm going to make it up to you, old boy. [Crashes into tombstone's head, still talking to himself] I'm going to make it up to ya. [Now he's talking to himself. Scans hill and gets really angry. He blows his horn] I'm making it up to you, old man. Hey, you made it up to me! Hey, you made it up to me!? Hey, you got me talking!? Hey, you got me talking!? Hey, you
