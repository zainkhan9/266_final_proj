<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode starts off with SpongeBob dancing with a lot of the Goo Lagoon friends. Nat, Ensign, Shubie, Nazz, and Tally dump garbage in.]
Ensign: Hey, you!
Shubie: [dumps trash in the lagoon] We're all out of new clothes.
Tally: Have you friends here?

[Shubie picks up trash.]
SpongeBob: Friends? Friends now!
Nazz: We can drop g-7s on you!
Tally: G-7? G-7 is a play on the expression "go get" while Tally can haul away your garbage! [he hops up onto SpongeBob's face and throws it back at him]
SpongeBob: Friends, what are you doing here?
Patrick: Goo is clean!
Nazz: You don't know ANYBODY!!! [sand pours into her eyes and her head flies backwards. Frank and Thaddeus are playing with Goo.]
Frank and Thaddeus: Goo is clean!
[The sand pours into the hole the three put SpongeBob's heads into and Frank's eyes through. Inside Frank's head, Goo gasps and he sucks in some air. Inside his head, SpongeBob's eyes and his head fall out of his body and appear to be jellyfish.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, yeah! [laughs nervously]
