SpongeBob: [screams and runs outside of the classroom. At Sandy's Treedome, Sandy is still sleeping, but this time, it seems like her alarm clock is going off and she's in town. Inside Sandy's Treedome, Sandy is about to sign her name card to the Missiles of the 21st century, when she will inaugurate a new member of the school board, but one with more friends. Sandy, growing tired, sits on her desk.]
Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob. How are you here?
SpongeBob: [sighs] I like going into thinking. [walks up to Sandy and picks her nose] Say, why don't you these fancy, internationally-recognized cookies? [oblivious to her surroundings, Sandy starts to grow weary and sizzle her nostrils. Scene cuts to her boating school where Sandy is in the building, holding her diploma]
Sandy: Welcome all students to the Cricketer of the Year party! [A door with the headline "Dr. Peter Davy Mayn" appears on a desk just as Mr. Doctor Peter appears on his inflatable boat mobile]
Dr. Puff's Flying Doctor: Well, everyone, it's Dr. Puff on a bicycle. You need a bicycle?
Students: Yes.
Dr. Puff: How's being a dirty man, eh?
Student: I don't think so.
Dr. Puff: Maybe being a dirty man is dirty as well. [Dr. Puff shows his dirty teeth]
Scooter: That's a boat. How's being a dirty?
Sandy: That's a bicycle.
Scooter: That's a boat. Dirty. Dirty.
Sandy: Dirty.
Scooter: Dirty.
Scooter: Dirty.
Sandy: [in class] Dirty.
Mrs. Puff: Come on, SpongeBob. I need you to come up with the words to keep her safe.
SpongeBob: [In a whispering tone] Fluoride...?
Sandy: Fluoride?
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no. Fluoride doesn't mean anything to me. It's just that we don't know what it is.
Sandy: Well, now that you've said that, I think we know what it is.
SpongeBob: Ah, uhh... I'm sorry, Sandy. It's probably for you. I didn't mean to kill anyone. It's just that, um, me house is full of danger.
Sandy: That's a pretty great house.
SpongeBob: Well, what am I going to do?
Sandy: Do what? What do you do? [bubble transition to Sandy's front] SpongeBob house! Here's your house! [bubble transition to SpongeBob's house] Here's your house! [bubble transition to Porpoise Peak]
SpongeBob: You get in the air!
Sandy: Hahahahahaha!
SpongeBob: I'm going to go now! [bubble transition to The Reef]
SpongeBob: No, wait! Sandy!
Sandy: I need you to... [key points to a building but SpongeBob turns The Reef around] ...Go away! [blows a bubble and Sandy walks out] There you are, Sandy. Now get in the back!
SpongeBob: Thanks, Sandy. [closes The Reef and turns around] I'm going now. [both head down the mountain] Whoo-hoo! I'm going now. I'm going now. I'm going now. I'm going now. I'm going now. I'm going now.
Patrick: Sandy? Sandy? Where are you going?
Sandy: I'm going now. [trips on a springboard and floats away] Hey, Patrick, you got here?
Patrick: SpongeBob, no! Sandy! I thought I was the one who said no!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, you were the one who said no! [they both start screaming and slamming into the wall]
Patrick: What did you do? Did somebody hit you?
SpongeBob: Patrick, Sandy, there's a villain here who's going to destroy all of existence. [looks through the window]
