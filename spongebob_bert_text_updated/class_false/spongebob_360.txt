[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is declining a customer's order and proceeds to attack him from the back]
Mr. Krabs: Stop it! Don't take it! Don't take it! [continues attacking Mr. Krabs with his fists] Stand back! [Mr. Krabs gets his butt kicked by Sandy] Whatever you do, stand back! [Sandy kneels down]
Sandy: What about when did you get your feet on that table safe?
Mr. Krabs: I was just telling you a story, boy. Squidward's taken the secret recipe of Krabby Patties and just how it tastes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, that's enough for one story. Me, too!
Sandy: Sure it is!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs share a good laugh. SpongeBob opens up a can and dips his head in the sauce]
SpongeBob: Ooh, something's kelp...
Mr. Krabs: ...and heh, SpongeBob. And that's SpongeBob's to great effect. Good-bye, Krusty Krab. [laughs]
SpongeBob: But what about SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs? Do you have any ketchup stories to tell?
Mr. Krabs: Two is ketchup. And three is no ketchup. Nobody needs the stories if they know how to tell them.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Mr. Krabs, [dips a coin into the sauce and blows a raspberry] they both come in...
Mr. Krabs: [pulls out a mustache] I had a mustache once. Two is no mustache.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Mr. Krabs, you sure do have a lot of ketchup stories to tell. What do you tell Mr. Krabs, boy?
Mr. Krabs: What? How do I tell you?
SpongeBob: I gotta keep my act together, Mr. Krabs, get me right this time.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Do you have any ketchup stories, too, boy?
SpongeBob: Well, the one and only, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob imagines a big patty on a plate with tiny SpongeBob Splash on the bottom, random stuff falling out of it and things flying everywhere]
Mr. Krabs: There's more ketchup stories, too, me boy. [SpongeBob runs over to a line of people]
SpongeBob: Hello, everybody. [everyone tries to listen to the story they want to hear]
Jimmy: Mr. Krabs, when did you get here?
Mr. Krabs: Today.
Jimmy: Me and my friends from school used to go canoeing.
Mr. Krabs: Go canoeing?
Jimmy: Yeah. Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And you have this great club: the Krusty Krab.
[everyone cheers]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Mr. K.
Mr. Krabs: Everyone! I'm sorry tootin' deprive me of some great news. Today, the Krusty Krab has grown to become a bloated and dilapidated mess! [his customers are all dirty and decaying] Allow me to present to you a little less impressive picture. Look at this! [the Krusty Krab is completely out of control, even by today's standards] Let's say it weren't for a second. A mere 20,000 square feet of underfloor living... [walks up to some customers]
Surly Fish: Let's put that down.
Mr. Krabs: Down here? [leans on Mr. Krabs and looks through time images of the restaurant and Bikini Bottom until he sees it clearly. He screams and runs away] No! No!
[cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Old Man Walker is painting the sign]
Mr. Krabs: What's wrong, Old Man Walker?
Old Man Walker: These doors will never open. Never!
Mr. Krabs: They will never ever open! These doors will be empty! [throws doors down giving him a sign of completion] Empty! [laughs] Empty! [opens the door and yelps] Empty!
[Cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Old Man Walker is welding the doors]
Mr. Krabs: This place is so cheap, even the greatest scrap metal thieves get in free.
Old Man Walker: [shows up at the front doors] I brought you some of my prized rusty welders duty bound. Step right up, folks, and get a job!
[The scene changes to Old Man Walker getting the cleaning tools. He gets in between
