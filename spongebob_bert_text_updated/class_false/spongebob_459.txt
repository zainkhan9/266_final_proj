[scene transitions to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: This is going to be great, Squidward. We always wanted a kid to come up and help us.
Squidward: How about a little personal info for you? [gets masticated and chews on his nose]
SpongeBob: [takes off hat] Um, hello... [takes off masticatin' and goes to SpongeBob's house to get his info] Here's your masticatin' history.
Squidward: History? Hey, stop! [SpongeBob grabs his hat]
SpongeBob: You never told me about your hat!
Squidward: [growls] It's my favorite invention!
SpongeBob: It was a lamp that let you talk. Talk talk talk talk. [SpongeBob reads a book] Ooh, Squidward, you sure have read the book on talk talk.
Squidward: [growls] I did not, SpongeBob. But you seem to have a point.
SpongeBob: Uh, no, I mean the book.
Squidward: And you are not a man! [SpongeBob gets on Squidward's shoulders] Speech talk talk talk [walks to the windows and screams]
Customer: Talk talk.
SpongeBob: Squidward, you have ruined my evening.
Squidward: And you even ruined mine! [SpongeBob gets off of Squidward] Speech talk talk [walks to the kitchen and takes out a spatula]
SpongeBob: And my food's ruined. Well, tonight's time for you to go on home and make Krabby Patties. [takes spatula. Looks around the kitchen. SpongeBob pokes his head through the kitchen window to see Krabby Patties not being made into a burger]
Customer: Oh! Speech talk !" [takes spatula and walks to the sink] Speech talk !" [pokes head through the kitchen window] Speech talk !" [makes himself a man for the customer] Speech talk !" [makes himself a man to protect his skin] Speech talk !" [pokes his head through the kitchen window] Speech talk !" [makes himself a man to babysit] Speech talk !" [makes himself a man to watch his son cut the vacation package off the Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I don't think you should be taking your leave.
Mr. Krabs: [Gulps] I don't either. Stay here and keep loafing out there all by yourself?
SpongeBob: No. I'm on it. [runs out and joins Mr. Krabs in his place]
Mr. Krabs: But I find the artistic side of you more important than the social.
SpongeBob: Uh, we don't like to be lumped in with the norm.
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Mr. Krabs. Isn't it time you told me what it was like to be an artist?
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I do whatever you want! It's not what it seems! [whacks Mr. Krabs with his cane] Well, about the leave.
Mr. Krabs: Leave what no one else is taking! [clicks his cane] Ah, let 'er go, son. [waves his arm around once; he smiles] I never thought I'd say this, but I am going to propose!
SpongeBob: Yay! [runs to the door; Mr. Krabs opens the door and SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk in] Isn't this a win-win?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. Because you, SpongeBob, brought out the best in me butler, Pat, Jack, and the butler himself. [SpongeBob raises an eyebrow] What could be worse than to be an artist?
SpongeBob: I'll show you, Mr. Krabs. I'll make something you won't soon forget. [drives off]
Mr. Krabs: That's it, boy. Don't be late.
[the butler drives off]
SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs. Have a good flight.
[the butler smashes into the windshield. The butler blows out the paint, making the butler look like he is doing his duty]
Mr. Krabs: That was tacky.
[the butler smashes into the windshield again and flies right through the kitchen window, breaking the butler's cans of paint. The butler crashes into the kitchen crow's nest]
Mr. Krabs: What
