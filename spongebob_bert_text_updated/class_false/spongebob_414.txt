[At Fancy!]
SpongeBob: Ooh, gosh, I knew it! How did you know it was me?!
Squidward: This place is dope! I knew it! Just me, me, [leans run over to Squidward] and SpongeBob, and Squidward, and SpongeBob, and...Squidward! [continues to go, but cuts to a crowd of people]
Pilar: One more, and I'm not in here!
Gus: SpongeBob is the new rock star!
Pilar: I knew him until he started dressing like him!
Pilar and Pilar Upheaval: Rock star! man!
[Cut to SpongeBob, in a fancy dress, blowing horns and holding a fan. Around him, there is a guy giving speeches and doing fancy dance-tours]
Pilar: Your new best friend?
SpongeBob: Yep.
Pilar: Let's go see him!
[Cut to Squidward, still in a fancy dress]
Squidward: Please, put him out of the show! [giggles]
[Then the crowd is inside Squidward's]
Female: [cheering]
French Narrator: [about 17 years later] Thirty celebrities take Squidward's stage at Fancy. One by one, they get embarrassed and embarrassed; they rip their clothes off, they spit on the stage and, finally, they get embarrassed again. Squidward is now very embarrassed]
Squidward: [now sitting on the stage with a very high chair and using the mouth to catch the audience's attention] I can see now. My fame will attract the unsophisticated. [to the audience): Can you please leave?
Female Fan #1: Yeah, you can't. Your name doesn't get past the first paragraph.
Squidward: Is there anything I can do to make things easier?
Female Fan #1: Yes, I could make Squidward's stage more wheelchair-accessible. I'm excited about the people's reaction to my glamorous presence.
Squidward: I don't!
Female Fan #1: [cheers] Can you please stop that?!
[Squidward laughs and the audience gasps, then they throw flowers at him and his entourage, then he hides behind the register boat and laughs]
SpongeBob: Ooh, how you doin', fellas.
Male Fish: You greatest friend I've ever known! Please meet SpongeBob here.
SpongeBob: Here ya go, Grandma.
Squidward: Hey!
SpongeBob: Welcome aboard, dear. I was wondering if you'd like to be a guest on the Fancy! Club picnic. [takes the seat belt and sits down] My airway must be a little bit thinner than I had imagined. It seems you're gonna have to take a trip that'll span many fields. Are you ready for the long line at the grocery store?
Female Fan #2: Absolutely, son.
SpongeBob: And this is the fate that awaits SpongeBob, as he struggles to cross fields! [crowd cheers and SpongeBob drags his feet]
French Narrator: Meanwhile, on the ground, the SpongeBob Effect continues.
SpongeBob: Gosh, I never realized how ugly this world is. It's all filled with misery and destruction! [laughs]
[Screen cuts to the destruction caused by the SpongeBob Effect. Cut to the ground, with a puddle of pink goo in the distance]
French Narrator: Later, eh, SpongeBob? I guess the curse of the SquarePants is lifted.
SpongeBob: Hey, I wasn't really looking.
Narrator: Later...
SpongeBob: [laughing] Hey, I was right! Curse the curse! Curse the curse! Curse the curse!
Narrator: Later...
SpongeBob: [laughing again] Curse the curse! Curse the curse!
Narrator: Later...
SpongeBob: [laughing again] Curse the curse! Curse the w--!
Narrator: Later...
SpongeBob: [laughing] Hey, I was right! Curse the curse! Curse the curse!
Narrator: Later...
SpongeBob: [laughing] Yeah, curse the curse! Curse the w--!
Narrator: Later...
SpongeBob: [laughing and sobbing as he floats above the water] Oh, Gary, I'm so sorry for your loss. My bestest friend is going on. I'll be right back.
Narrator: Oh, Gary... [sees SpongeBob leaving] Well, there he goes. Not leaving for long. I better find him. [SpongeBob walks over to a flower stand] Where are
