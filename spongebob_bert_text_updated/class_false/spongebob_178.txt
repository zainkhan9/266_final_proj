[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is singing to the customers in the bathroom.]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Squidward always has brunch with the prettiest guy in town.♪
[An anchovy comes in and replaces the absent Mr. Krabs. The anchovy makes his way to the table where Plankton replaces him.]
Plankton: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Mister Lankton. I'm gonna make some Krabby Patties. [inserts patties here] There you go, mister.
[The anchovy goes to serve his burger. Plankton takes the burger from the anchovy and dips it in the sauce. The anchovy's eyes turn into dollar signs and he eats it. The anchovy's eyes turn into dollar signs and he eats it. The anchovy's eyes turn into the dollar signs and he eats it. The anchovy passes out again.]
Mr. Krabs: [drools] That's a good sign. [laughs]
[Plankton throws the burger and the customers run out. Plankton, who is disguised as a dollar sign, runs away. The customers become annoyed with Plankton and run again. The customers become annoyed with Plankton and continue to run. The customers become annoyed with Plankton and continue to run. The customers become annoyed with Plankton and continue to run.
Plankton: What are you doing?
Mr. Krabs: [puts on mouth made smile] Uh-huh, I'm a cheap shot.
Plankton: [chuckles] So long! The boy's got me dilemma.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, one can only luckarily luck. [lifts his head with his claw]
[Mr. Krabs starts struggling to break through Plankton's disguise. But the disguise was too broken to stop the dial from sounding. Mr. Krabs emerges from the disguise and is completely beaten up.]
Mr. Krabs: NOOOOOO! Bahah!
SpongeBob: [stares at Plankton] You're my best friend ever.

SpongeBob: And you're going to be fine. [laughs. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs lying on the floor of the Krusty Krab.] Okay, here it goes.

[he opens the kitchen door, and there is a Krabby Patty on a plate next to a can of soup] Hmmm, this hot, spicy, my new-found loyalty. [sighs, takes the patty, and pours some of the soup on it] I can hardly move! [he tries to move it, but it's tangled in the knots, and he groans] Ahhhh! The knotty bits!

[A few hours pass. It is night now.]
SpongeBob: How long do you think Mr. Krabs will be here?
[SpongeBob's screen reveals that Mr. Krabs has just finished performing a ritual that he calls "trick". The film opens, and Mr. Krabs sits in the seat he is in, listening to music that SpongeBob is wearing, when suddenly, he collapses.]
