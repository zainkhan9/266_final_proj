[The episode begins with Gary snoring. The screen fades to black.]
SpongeBob: Wake up, Gary. 
Gary: [sleepily]Snore. 
SpongeBob: That's right, you don't need Snore Gary anymore. 
[Gary slithers off. SpongeBob yawns and flips his screen. The scene changes to show the exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple. He is in it, but it is with Gary that SpongeBob is sleeping. Gary clicks its tongue and wakes SpongeBob up. SpongeBob looks around and sees that his room is really SpongeBob's. He goes back to sleep and yawns as he goes to sleep. He goes to open the door and see a snail on a television. He gets out of bed and goes to pick it up.]
SpongeBob: Gary, what are you doing in my house? It's my brainchild, The SpongeBob SquarePants Snail Dog.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Gary.
[Gary puts its snout on and slithers off. SpongeBob sees a giant, purple, and green snail on the TV. He turns to look at it and laugh. The snail picks up SpongeBob and sticks his head out. SpongeBob looks at his head and realized it was no good.]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Gary, this is pretty funny. Oh, I know! I'll take that down immediately.
[SpongeBob takes off his double-dark TV and looks at his TV, which is still playing]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Gary, I'm not really getting this gnarly anymore. [Gary jumps on top of SpongeBob]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! [SpongeBob sees that Gary is licking Gary] Gary, you're so smart. What are you doing? [SpongeBob imagines himself in his reality] In that case, I'm gonna show you this and tell you how to fix it.
[SpongeBob wrings Gary off his head]
SpongeBob: This is fixin' it, Gary!
[SpongeBob pulls a lever which activates a huge explosion. Three huge, purple, purple, and green, round patties pour out of the floor]
SpongeBob: Huh? [SpongeBob gets blown in]
Purple Eel: [screams]
Green Egret: [runs off]
SpongeBob: Hey, what the... Gary, hey there, Gare-Bear? [SpongeBob appears, holding the Gary it was born in] What do you want?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, I can't control myself. [tries to turn the TV off]
Gary: [happily] Meow.
[the green eel sniffs]
SpongeBob: [to Gary] Oh, look, buddy, my TV is on.
Gary: [happily] Meow.
[the TV off]
SpongeBob: Bye, pal. Have fun at home.
Gary: [smiling and happy]
[Gary slithers to his pal, takes out a pair of scissors, and starts cutting some of the Gary's teddy bears]
SpongeBob: There they are, Gary the Snail. [Gary takes the teddy bears and puts them on his head] Whew. For a day.
[Green Egret sniffs the patties]
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my green eel. Well, didn't see you that way, didn't you, igbot?
[Gary puts the teddy bears on his head]
SpongeBob: Hey, Gary. They're giving Gary his golden treatment.
[Gary slithers back to his pal]
Gary: Meow.
[Gary returns to his pal]
Green Egret: Hey, buddy. Let's go out for a delicious, delicious, hamburger.
SpongeBob: No, no, pal. No, pal. You could be working at the kelp stand.
[Green Egret hands Gary the burger]
SpongeBob: You could use these. [hands Gary the burger]
Green Egret: Just one...questions.
Does this restaurant have a ask and answer session!?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Holy shrimp! How did we get here?
Isabelle: That's it! [shakes her body] I have an answer for you! [waves her wig and throws an acorn on her head]
Isabelle: [screams] I'm scared, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [jumps in the chair and
