Timmy: [interrupts] Will SpongeBob be here soon?
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Timmy, can I help you?
Timmy: Dig that... what Dig that?
SpongeBob: Computer. My old stomping ground. Just toppled over.
Timmy: Oh, I wonder where this slob's buried himself.
SpongeBob: [disappointed] That's where I thought you'd find it.
Timmy: Oh, I hate to tell you, SpongeBob, but burying your old computer is so much easier than laying your old computer on the counter.
SpongeBob: You're right. Where are we? You ain't found a button! Let's dig around. [moves counter with his teeth while searching]
Timmy: Well, I don't know where the old stomp was, but... SpongeBob SquarePants... I don't know what button that is!
SpongeBob: Well, dig us to Bikini Bottom.
Timmy: I don't know where we are, but... SpongeBob SquarePants... I don't know where we are, but... SpongeBob SquarePants... [giggles] I don't know where we are, but... SpongeBob SquarePants... [moves some more with his teeth while mashing the keys] I don't know where we are, but... SpongeBob SquarePants... [moves his legs a little bit] I don't know where we are, but... SpongeBob SquarePants... [moves his head a little bit] I don't know where we are, but... SpongeBob SquarePants... [laughs] I don't know where we are, but... [pushes a button and a crack comes up] I don't know where we are, but... [laughs] I don't know where we are, but... [laughs] I don't know where we are, but... [laughs] Where we were...!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Where we were...?!
Harold: SpongeBob is buried under this rock.
SpongeBob: But it's buried SpongeBob alive!
Harold: It is over here.
SpongeBob: But it's been buried here too!
Harold: That's where the new fuzzist is! [puts a sticker over the old sticker]
SpongeBob: Hey there, buddy. We're still gonna be around here when you get back.
Harold: That's silly. I'm not thinking about this instant. [starts to cry] I'm thinking about these little gold baby buttons! [cries]
SpongeBob: [laughs] They're so valuable! Why, we should make them...
Harold: You're crazy. You have to make them, SpongeBob. buttonum minu...
SpongeBob: ...baby.
Harold: Maybe later we can play...
[cut to SpongeBob's house where the kids are in the yard]
Kids: Quiet!
SpongeBob: Okay, kids, let's not be loud. Okay, kids, put the switch in the wall. Come on, Gary, I'm thinking about town.
Gary: [off-screen] Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! No! Gary! Oh, Gary! No! Gary! Not now! Gary! I'm tired of you! Oh, Gary! I'll do you one. Come on, buddy. Put the switch in the wall. [opens a cabinet and puts the switch on top of Gary] Gary! I'm thinking about town. Gary! I'm thinking about my house. Oh, I'm going to get mummmed! [puts on his hat] Gary! I'm thinking about my yard. [bends down to pick up a flower] Hey, Gary. [grabs Gary] You know, it's not as if this place is... [doors open and SpongeBob sees dumpster pop out of the dumpster that the kids were in]
Kids: Meow [Gary closes the door]
SpongeBob: Gary! You're a sensation! [SpongeBob dances around] FOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!! [SpongeBob dances around drinking waterfalls, destroying a, omitting, part of the island]
Kids: Meow [fish walks over and picks up the kids]
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary! You woke me up again! [SpongeBob looks down and bashes his hand on the island's top half, knocking it over] [to the other half of SpongeBob] SpongeBob, what are you doing? [SpongeBob goes back on his side] You can't fool the human eye! [SpongeBob lands on the ground and gets up] I've got to get going. What are you doing? Help! Help!
