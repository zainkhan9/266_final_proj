Flying Dutchman: ♪Oi nocturnal flies, how do I keep it down? Even ghosts sleep through our long week of cleaning. [his voice echoes]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Yes, my good man, sir.
Flying Dutchman: [his voice echoes] ♪If you could stop all this, and only focus on your craft, you would be nothing but a beautiful statue to yourself. Hmmm, it's quite romantic, isn't it?
SpongeBob: ♪Idiot shields! If you could stop all this, you would be nothing but a ugly, ghost-like ghost, forever changed!♪
Flying Dutchman: [while doing so] Idiot ghost shield! [casting someone else's name] Idiot shield! [casting another ghost] Whoooooosh, that's a good one. [casting Patrick] Oops, I didn't think to do that.
Patrick: Oops, I didn't think to call you Patrick.
Flying Dutchman: ♪If you could only watch for the rust, you'd be everything I hoped for me. A saintly man, a dweeb, a dope, a thief, a bum, a hunk of stuff, a nobody, for all eternity!♪ [makes a rainbow with his spells] A saintly man, a dweeb, a dope, a slumber party, a thief, a slasher, a moll, a sweaty sock, a sweaty sock goodbye,♪ [makes another rainbow with his spells] A nobody, a stepson, for all eternity!♪
SpongeBob: Patrick, what's wrong with Patrick?
Flying Dutchman: If you could stop the Forever Evil, you'd be nothing but a horrible nightmare!
SpongeBob: You're right, Patrick! It's okay to hate! [starts crying again. Later, he appears at the Chum Bucket trying to clear his throat] I've cleared the air, I'm awake, I'm free! I'm free! Free! [now he's lying on the floor in his room] And I'm okay! See? I'm completely recharged up! And still warm. [now he's lying on his bed, with a straw up his nose] I'm so glad the Flying Dutchman's cured! I hope he's not a zombie, already. He just needs a few more craters to make him a little better. [starts crying again. Later, he appears in SpongeBob's yard, trying to clear his throat] I've cleared the air, I'm awake, I'm free! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay! [lays some dirt on himself] I think I cleared the air.
SpongeBob: [puts a hose in his head and then, when he clears it, he emerges from the ground] Ooh...
Flying Dutchman: [babbles while clearing himself of any smoke] Leave me to finish my work!
SpongeBob: [still breathing] I'm not finished! I've cleared the air!
Flying Dutchman: [still breathing] Leave me to finish my work!
SpongeBob: [clears throat of the smoke and clears it back up] I'm not finished! I've cleared the air!
Flying Dutchman: Leave me to finish my work!
SpongeBob: [clears throat of the smoke again and then returns to his original position, but now has a skullcap over his head] I'm not finished! I've cleared the air!
Flying Dutchman: Leave me to finish my work!
SpongeBob: [clears throat of the smoke again, but now has a head full of steam] I'm not finished! I've cleared the air!
Flying Dutchman: Leave me to finish my work!
SpongeBob: [clears throat of the smoke again, now has the helmet on his head] I'm not finished! I've cleared the air!
Flying Dutchman: Leave me to complete my work!
SpongeBob: [looks around] Well, I think we've cleared all of the skies over Bikini Bottom. [Everyone laughs] Good times.
[Bikini Bottom gets darker and darker. People walk out of work stapling a banner they've just drawn. It is around this time that the Flying Dutchman once again comes out]
Flying Dutchman: [glances down] Ahhhhhhh!
SpongeBob: [screams] The sky is dark! And the dark must end! [As the Dutchman walks away, the Bikini Bottomites come back and walk out of their homes]
Nat Peterson: Hey! Where
