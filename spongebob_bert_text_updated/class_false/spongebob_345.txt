[SpongeBob and Patrick are outside in the road and SpongeBob hits the button on the remote.]
SpongeBob: [Laughs heartily] Great Guppies, let's go see how it is! [SpongeBob jumps in the boatmobile and takes Patrick with him]
Patrick: Go get water, [SpongeBob pushes Patrick in the water] water is the life of Atlantis! And what are you going to eat today?
SpongeBob: Oh, this is just water.
Patrick: Gotcha! [SpongeBob and Patrick are in deep water underwater]
Dolphin: I hear you! [Dolphin gets in the boatmobile and waters it up]
SpongeBob: Water! [Both drive into a deep water depression and start to drive into a fresh one]
Deep Diversion: Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I don't get it.
Deep Diversion: You begin your swim, [Dolphin whimpers] ...following two bright stars. [SpongeBob drives into a deep water tunnel] Well, it's pronounced "doh-DOH-wee-do". [SpongeBob drives into a fresh one]
SpongeBob: I can't remember the last time I've had to explain myself, other than last week, when I was asked to come up back to Atlantis to complete my science-fiction novel...
Deep Diversion: Next. [Dolphin waves a leg around with the other leg]
SpongeBob: I don't have to explain myself. [Dolphin backs away slowly]
Deep Diversion: Then you do it.
SpongeBob: Then I'll just have to say it... [Back in time] Ah, back in time, in this dimension, we lived under a tyrant. [Takes out a tooth]
Deep Diversion: So too you now, now that I'm done with your book.
SpongeBob: What are you saying?
Deep Diversion: My golden tooth is the only tooth you have.
SpongeBob: Oh, we are a planetoid away from it.
Deep Diversion: And if you don't believe it, go and look for it in a few hundred years, tsk, tsk, tsk.
SpongeBob: Era?
Deep Diversion: Uh, yeah. We're a little bit behind the curve now. Sometimes, we have to go turbo. [Normal voice] We're still a little ways from our most advanced state. [Normal voice] Oh, this is gonna be tougher than I've ever be a part of.
SpongeBob: Maybe we should give up science altogether.
Deep Diversion: We're in a different part of the explosion-proofing device than before.
Mr. Krabs: What's going on? The bus just threw out of service!
SpongeBob: That's what you think.
Mr. Krabs: We returned to the Krusty Krab for some science! We've got to find a way to get back home!
SpongeBob: No, we found a way out! [Starts walking out] Science!
Patrick: Hey, who threw out the Krabby Patty for us?
SpongeBob: That is just the tip of my hat to you!
Patrick: Hmm...maybe you should follow in my footsteps. My uncle had a Krabby Patty, and he wished it had been on the menu.
SpongeBob: What was he talking about?
Patrick: Why, it's on the menu!
SpongeBob: Hey, we were in the Bikini Bottom Society!
Patrick: We're getting a Bikini Bottom Society membership fee of just shy of a dime!
SpongeBob: Well, I...
Mr. Krabs: Science! Let's not be hasty. We've got some important business to do!
SpongeBob: Science?! What's the holdup here?
Mr. Krabs: The shoplifting cops. They're here. Go get them.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Go get them?
Mr. Krabs: Why, they're right here.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're here!
Mr. Krabs: But we can't let this town down. We have to go and find it.
SpongeBob: We're gonna have to leave this town, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Hey! Go get a load of those cops. I said "bullshit!"
SpongeBob: Get a load of them? Hey, don't be shy, he's a cop-errant!
Patrick: Hey, I was in the Krusty Krab accident and Ianthelthesome! [hides behind his house and Patrick's
