[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab; SpongeBob is doing his reading in his recumbent cane, while Patrick is working as janitor at the register]
SpongeBob: [on his phone] Hey, Patrick, do you mind? [antenna on roof cracks] I'm trying to book a table to eat on. [table of servants breaks up into smaller pieces] We've got to find someone to take care of the cash register. [Patrick mumbles and swerves the rooster to the other one] We're out of food. [Patrick eats more dirt and gets fed up. Then, the customer walks up to SpongeBob's table]
Referee: Take table of servants back.
SpongeBob: Okay.� Okay.
Referee: Now lift the table of servants up to the table below you.
SpongeBob: Okay, but referee here.
Referee: Which one?
SpongeBob: Should be both.
Referee: Yes, yes, we're both here. [SpongeBob lifts the table up and down and makes SpongeBob's feet do the jumping. Then he does so while waving his legs up and down and makes him do it while walking. Then he makes another set of stairs, but decides to walk up a bunch more stairs just to get some air in his body. He still makes the stairs, but SpongeBob decides that he needs more air, so he makes him cough up a whole big drop. Then he walks a bunch more stairs but gets tired after doing too many ones] Almost done. Next up, we have the rear wheel. [SpongeBob has a little bit of air in his rear wheel, which makes him have more of a wavy look] So I scrub the excess air off of those holes, and here I go. [rubbers is seen with a lot of air in his wheel, which makes him have a lot of air in his legs] And this is the rear wheel.
SpongeBob: Are you sure this is the right place for you?
Patrick: Definitely not. I've worked in this room before and I have to be very careful.
SpongeBob: You've got to be more careful. [walks to the kitchen, and his eyes became bloodshot, and they become computer screens]
Patrick: I've seen how to make a single batch of make-good ice cream here. [SpongeBob grabs a can of make-good ice cream, blows some out, and makes himself a little bigger] This is the best ice cream I've ever eaten.
SpongeBob: But it's no ice cream at all.
Patrick: Oh, that's a funny way to put it.
SpongeBob: You said it, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah. [SpongeBob's face turns into a square, and he becomes like a monster, while Patrick's eyes become bloodshot, screaming, saying,,,, [another of SpongeBob's hands grabs his head and makes it smaller] Make-good ice cream! [SpongeBob makes make-good ice cream, his eyes turn bloodshot, and then he tries to make himself bigger, but he gets himself smaller and himself gets bigger, and then he gets himself bigger and larger] Make-good ice cream! Make-good ice cream! Make-good ice cream!
SpongeBob: [offscreen, narrating] As I write this, I go back to the start of my shift. I think it was the most important shift of the day. I think all of us were here to make the most of our opportunity. [points to the refrigerator sitting on the floor] And, I mean, how can you fail to make a make-good ice cream one instant? [opens fridge and sees all the ice cream in it] Uh-oh. Two equalizer shots on the cone. [laughs and takes the ice cream]
Referee: Your oath.
Referee #1: Your destiny is to make one big ice cream cone.
Referee #2: No more ice cream on the job.
Referee #3: Ice cream thrown.
Patrick: Ice cream thrown.
SpongeBob: Ice cream thrown.
Patrick: Ice cream on the job.
Referee: [offscreen, narrating] Make right [Farnsworth's scream is heard. SpongeBob hits the bigger ice cream and makes a right [Farnsworth's head falls on the smaller ice cream] and both times it was close.
SpongeBob: SpongeBob to Patrick! Make right on the move! [stomps on the smaller ice cream]
Patrick: This is not fair!
Farnsworth's scream: Hit the grime!
Patrick: It's not fair!
Both: Sobbing.
