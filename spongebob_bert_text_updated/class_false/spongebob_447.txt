[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, this isn't it. It's just as I've said. No, this isn't it. It's just another-- [Cuts to a customer holding his mouth to his work hat, who looks just like his picture matches that of a waiter, his boss is in his office, and makes a face like Mr. Krabs looks like Mr. Krabs like a crazy person] Shoot, Mr. Krabs, I'm breaking news to you!
Harold: Hey, cool.
Customers: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Listen, guys, I'm gonna break this ice-cold ice-cold deal! [Takes his hat off, and puts it on his head] Deal! Buy him a Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs, you did it, boy. You got the deal.
Mr. Krabs: And I'm gonna break it all away, [Opens a door that leads to a room with a TV in it] with my new friend, the sweetest, laziest $40 handshakeer in the business!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy.
Mr. Krabs: You got the deal.
SpongeBob: Oh, I gotta get going.
Mr. Krabs: Off I go. [Walks away]
SpongeBob: Ahh, bye.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what do you want?
SpongeBob: Well, the big surprise is actually here.
Mr. Krabs: [Looks at SpongeBob] You know what that means?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Mr. Krabs: It means...
SpongeBob: No, no, no, it means...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, that's it! It means you're not gonna break this $35 handshake anymore!
[Cut to SpongeBob walking down the street with other fast food workers]
Abigail: Hey, everybody! I want to talk to you!
Tom: Talk to me over something.
SpongeBob: What? This is great! Word is, this $35 check is coming in right on time! [SpongeBob gets angry. Later, Mr. Krabs is eating a Krabby Patty]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what brings you in, boy?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, sir. Couldn't you just come here all wrong?
Mr. Krabs: Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm sorry, what do I owe you?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I just wanted to make sure you all had your information straight when you left.
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, probably someone would have to pay me more money.
SpongeBob: Oh, sir, I don't suppose you have any customers today.
Mr. Krabs: [Looks at the customers] Hmmm, say what? [Gets interrupted by squeals and crunching noises until it looks like SpongeBob is stuck on the floor trying to flip the patty at the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob, why are you still here?
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs. I wanted you to fix me register.
Mr. Krabs: Well, how are we gonna get our next customer here? Squeaky, snappy, yes, sir!
Squidward: This is ridiculous! Can't you see I'm making my own Krabby Patties? [Zoom in on the customers eating Krabby Patties]
Dairy Nuts: Chewy bits, chewy bits.

Mr. Krabs: How do you like them, boys? [SpongeBob tastes the chewy bits] Ooh, crunchy bits! [Another bumping motorcycle drops them off] I still don't get that formula.
Squidward: Well, at least they don't sneak into my house. [Screams as a truck crashes into the Krusty Krab] What's next? [Goes over to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are cleaning the wallpaper]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, show some respect for your former self.
Mr. Krabs: Respect? Why don't you clean my office?
SpongeBob: Oh, I think I know what I should do...
Mr. Krabs: Go make me a sandwich.
Squidward: That's not what I said.
SpongeBob: That's what I meant by, Squidward? That's what you should do...
Squidward: Then when your sandwich hits the counter, you can adjust the toppings on it.
SpongeBob:
