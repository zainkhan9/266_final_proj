[the episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to work]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! The Krusty Krab is so fancy. I'll show them by tram. [trams drop them into the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: Wow. The Krusty Krab is so fancy! I'll show them by tram. [trams again, but only this time Patrick is riding SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: By tram. [trams get dropped into the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: By tram. [trams are dropped into the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: By tram. [trams are dropped into the Krusty Krab]
Patrick: By tram. [trams are dropped into the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: By tram. [trams are dropped into the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Why is it that the world's most important restaurant is closed? That makes me so mad! [SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming? "Open" sound? Squidward insane?!]
Patrick: Why is it that the only restaurant in town that I like is in a place that I like? [SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming? "Wet" sound? Squidward insane?!]
Squidward: [Screams loudly] Why is it that such a nice restaurant is closed?
SpongeBob: It's too boring!
Patrick: [Ecstatic] We are still in the restaurant business, where we started.
Squidward: And you?
SpongeBob: No. And then we started working at the mall, and you.
Patrick: Gee, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab is the most expensive business in Bikini Bottom! So if you don't want to pay, then don't work there. I'm just here to help.
Patrick: Gee, are you trying to say that I hate working here?
SpongeBob: Uhh, no. That's really something.
Patrick: Gee, are you saying that you have no idea what I'm talking about?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sorry. [talks in a very business-like tone] I'm uh... I don't know.
Patrick: Gee, it's nice to know.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. I don't know? [pokes Patrick in the head with his cane] Okay, that's it. [takes Patrick's cane] I'm not sure I like it. I feel very uncomfortable. [walks out] After all, I'm here to help.
Patrick: Gee, just getting started.
SpongeBob: [sitting at a table] Sorry I'm late. [walks to the table and opens the door] And now, to be completely honest. [touches his stand. The lights turn on] Where is this nice hi-fi tape, SpongeBob?
Patrick: You're not in the mood for this hi-fi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I'm in the mood for: [sitting next to Patrick, who is now old and wrinkly] that nice old turntable, [takes the turntable] and this hi-fi...
All: Huh? [get caught up in the proceedings]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you grilling today, boy?
SpongeBob: Did I?
Mr. Krabs: Don't wanna lose ya, boy.
SpongeBob: You want me grilling you slop?
Mr. Krabs: You have to go into that kitchen of yours, boy.
SpongeBob: The kitchen of yours?
Mr. Krabs: What? Yes, that's the one in which I'm cooking up the most important and most important food: the Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob: [gets out a Krabby Patty] A Krabby Patty! [the Krusty Krab doors open and a green Krabby Patty appears]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what do you want with me old granny?
SpongeBob: That depends, Mr. Krabs. How much do you want me to give you?
Mr. Krabs: How much do you want me to give you?... [gets OUT of the Krusty Krab and pulls up his leg. He pats SpongeBob] Whatever way you look'd preserve the Krusty Krab's secrets, sir! [stretches out his claw]
SpongeBob: Shh. [looks ahead at the view of the Chum Bucket] The finest eating bunks are where the finest delicious food is prepared.
