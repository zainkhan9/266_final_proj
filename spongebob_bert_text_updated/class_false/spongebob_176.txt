[episode starts with Gary watching TV]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob's arm gets a bump and releases itself onto the screen] Oh, that is nice. [takes a photo of his badge that says "Employee of the Month" on it] Next up, Gary, is...[opens his door] door! [jumps onto SpongeBob's arms and hughes him]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [takes a photo of his badge that says "Employee of the Month" on it] Next up, Patrick, you got Squidward covered in bacon grease! [rolls over to Squidward] Squidward, what's with the bacon grease? [shows Squidward with his butt and hat on]
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, this is nice. So many pictures to choose from. [notices his photo and laughs] SpongeBob! [takes a photo of his butt and hat] SpongeBob! Patrick! [takes a photo of his butt and hat] Employee of the month!
[Squidward is screaming and acting like SpongeBob. Patrick is acting like SpongeBob. SpongeBob is laughing uncontrollably while jumping around while doing so]
Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob, do you think that I'm... [bumps into Patrick]
Patrick: No, I'm just kidding!
Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob, what are you doing?! [worriedly]
SpongeBob: I'm here for you Squidward.
[Squidward screams and panics. He goes for a few seconds in between screams and panics. He puts his hand over his eyes and starts to grab his phone. When SpongeBob knocks on Squidward's door, the phone rings.]
Squidward: [opens door] Hello?
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward. I just got back from a week out, and I.. uh... [pokes his eye] want to... [groans] go home? I... want... to- [groans] home...
Squidward: [worriedly] SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: I just wanted to say that I'm... [his eye twitches] That means he's seeing you.
Squidward: [chuckles] Don't say anything, SpongeBob. I've only got a few hours of shine left.
SpongeBob: I don't need you, Squidward. I've got all the stars in the sky. I'm going on the holiday. I know. HOME'S THE CAPTIVE.
Squidward: No, I haven't.
SpongeBob: Well, then, uh, let's go home.
[Squidward takes out a rulebook for "Copyright Infringing Things"]
Squidward: [opens rulebook] For the second time, I'm not having this problem.
SpongeBob: I'm afraid you're going to issue an owner order for using the bathroom, Squidward.
Squidward: No, I won't you copying me. Help!
[SpongeBob looks for "Copy" in the ordering window]
SpongeBob: Okay! [tries copying SpongeBob but can't find him] What about my rules?
Squidward: Hmm, I'll have those. [SpongeBob runs off he sees his picture in the book] Interesting. Here's my pictures in book.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, that won't go down. [runs off and runs back with SpongeBob's pictures in the book] I'll need those if I'm gonna copy here SpongeBob.
Squidward: Hmm, mm-hmm. [thinking] Hmm, mm-hmm. [thinking] I probably wouldn't be able to copy SpongeBob over all those trouble and still get the magazine.
SpongeBob: But I'm good at it. If I keep doing that, I'm going to be good.
Squidward: Hmm-mm-hmm. [thinking] I probably wouldn't be good at all this. [spins eyes in pencil skirt while laughing]
SpongeBob: [laughs] You sure are. Stroke that. Stroke that so hard you blink. Stroke that much, babe. [spins eyes in to the kissy-bee movie]
Squidward: [thinking] Hmm, mm-hmm.
[SpongeBob slightly stretches his eyes out. After a few seconds, his face becomes the bathtub and you become the sink. You become the sink.]
