[the episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Hmm, a seaberry cart! Maybe we should plant some seeds here. [sees a farmer in his garden] Hey, he's giving away his seeds? I'll just go buy some prune seeds for me treedome!
Farmer: Give it over, Patrick.
SpongeBob: Okay. But what's wrong with the seed?
Farmer: Nothing, dear. [gives SpongeBob the tray of prune seeds and SpongeBob the wheelbarrow of green onions] There you go. You can grow any you want.
SpongeBob: Okay. Why don't you try your hands first? They make blessed noises
Farmer: Well, I lack hands, and I use my fingers instead.
Patrick: Psst, is that what you said?
Farmer: [whispering] Oh, sorry, Patrick. Psst, you don't like the sound. [gives SpongeBob the seed and SpongeBob the wheelbarrow of green onions]
SpongeBob: Okay. [walks to his garden and sprouts meatballs] Fruitballs. [throws them in the bin and plants them in the refrigerator] Meatballs. [starts to munch on them]
Patrick: Gotta get those protein shakes! [picks up the meatballs and eats them]
SpongeBob: Ouch. [laughs] They go much better with the food now.
Farmer: Ooh, I get the sense.
SpongeBob: Who's giving these poor folks money?
Farmer: To whom? I say... they're acting like peasants! [moves away from the peasants and continues eating them]
Patrick: What are you talking about?
Farmer: Feeding Mr. Krabs.
Patrick: And eating his patties?
Farmer: For his hair! [throws hair from his head and eats it]
Patrick: Mr. Krabs is acting like it! [heruns toward them]
SpongeBob: Run! Mr. Krabs! [throws them in Mr. Krabs' mouth] Mr. Krabs, put an end to this madness! [They run out of the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob comes out with a bag of potatoes and barks] They're no use, Patrick!
Patrick: This is exactly the kind of thing I wanted to hear your tell you about... your business.
SpongeBob: Tell you what?
Patrick: I wanted to hear him tell you about his... his business.
SpongeBob: Potato chip frijoles?
Patrick: Exactly! And how about your brioche... [slaps his face] What do you call it?
SpongeBob: I don't know any brioche, Patrick.
Patrick: [laughs] Argh! [laughs] How about your own little blue one? [laughs]
SpongeBob: [laughs with Patrick] Come on, Patrick. You can be anything you want!
Patrick: Anything?! Why, thank you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Why, thank you, too, Patrick?
Patrick: I couldn't quite make the brioche I wanted, and the buns we couldn't find are selling out! [laughs] Look, SpongeBob, I'm selling all of you! Tell me what you want!
SpongeBob: I want a Krabby Patty, a Krabby Patty, a Krabby Patty, a Krabby Patty, a Krabby Patty, a Krabby Patty, a Krabby Patty!
Patrick: Well, then... [SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: I want a Krabby Patty, I want a Krabby Patty, I want a Krabby Patty, a Krabby Patty, a Krabby Patty, a Krabby Patty...
[Patrick's eyes get BIGS at Patrick. Patrick's mouth goes dry, then out of his eyes comes HELLO!!]
Narrator: One Shift Later...
SpongeBob and Patrick?! What is going on!?
Patrick: SpongeBob and I are having trouble getting inside the freezer...
SpongeBob: We can't even get in the freezer...
Patrick: Stop saying that!
SpongeBob: It's not possible!
Patrick: Well, then, you are inside...
SpongeBob: ...the freezer.
Patrick: [Stood back out] The freezer?!
SpongeBob: [outraged, then calm] I'm freaking out!
Patrick: [shouting] Let me touch it! What is the secret of the automatic trowel??
SpongeBob: I know the answer to that, Patrick! How do you explain the Automatic Trowel with Mouth Guard?
