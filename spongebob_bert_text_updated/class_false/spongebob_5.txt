Squidward: Another year, another bottle of bubble gum...
SpongeBob: [as he runs] SpongeBob! Come on! We have to get out of here! [SpongeBob leaps away and runs as fast as he could before falling flat on the ground after a few seconds]
Squidward: I can't believe it. Another year with that same Patrick. He's gonna be disappointed.
SpongeBob: Doy, doy, doy.
Patrick: I can't imagine another other. [has a cow's mouth full of bubble gum but not a brain]
Squidward: Patrick?
Patrick: Maybe I should change the band. [has a smart phone but not the heart as Squidward hands it to Patrick]
Squidward: Hello!
Patrick: Say, how do you like my new heart? I think it would be cool.
Squidward: Oh, I think I'd like it. I think it'd be cool.
Patrick: Hey, watch where you're going.
Squidward: I'm going to set you free.
Patrick: I'm afraid so.
Squidward: [slams the door] Man, this is the worst way to lose your job.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, there's a new employee in town.
Patrick: Woo! Don't be sad, Squidward. You won't be needing this anymore.
Squidward: Hey, that's my old band, now back to releasing chum!
Patrick: Wow, they're still out there. I guess I'll keep working for free.
SpongeBob: Well, I guess I'll have to make my way back into my old band. [laughs]
Squidward: [running away] They're just leaving.
Patrick: I've got some serious business to win. [takes a bite out of a patty, Squidward's nose grows out] Woo, Pat, you got to do it! There goes me two free Krabby Patties. [as he picks up the patty, a fly flies towards him, and the patty lands on his face] Huh? Huh? [groans] Oh, well. Maybe the time has come to give me two golden Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: [takes the patty] Don't be sad, Patrick. You won't be needing it anymore.
Patrick: Yeah, I'll be using it. [SpongeBob takes the patty then puts a new one] Just top it off and be done.
SpongeBob: Bye, Patrick.
Squidward: [gets in his boat and drives away] Gee, it's strange that all these wonderful smells are invading my sanctum sanri.
Patrick: Hmm? Pardon me, SpongeBob, but where's my patty?
SpongeBob: Uh, not now, Pat.
Patrick: No time, SpongeBob. Stop craving me. [stomach rumbles]
SpongeBob: Pat... what is it?
Patrick: I've got some serious food in the fridge.
SpongeBob: My favorite!
Patrick: What's that?
SpongeBob: It's my beloved barnacle back.
Patrick: He doesn't look so good, SpongeBob. He looks good enough to eat.
SpongeBob: What's wrong with him?
Patrick: I don't know what's wrong with me. I can't go hungry without my patty. SpongeBob, grab that barnacle and come eat me. [Patrick grabs it and so does SpongeBob. Both there is a cut-scene later. The scene freezes to a shot of the Krusty Krab] Okay, SpongeBob, we've got a restaurant that looks good and white as a bowling ball and I want it to look good too. Whoâ€” who is this?
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: I don't think this is a good sign.
SpongeBob: I don't know who this Patrick is, but he's perfect! [cut to later] I'm going to give this Patrick a $1.00 fee.
Squidward: All right, Patrick, give this to me.
Patrick: Go ahead, you don't have any money.
Squidward: Give me that! Patrick, this isn't working!
Patrick: [opens up the $1.00 bag of flour] It's not working.
Squidward: This isn't working!
Patrick: It's not working!
Squidward: This isn't working!
Patrick: It's not working!
SpongeBob: It's not working!
Squidward: It's not working!
SpongeBob: It's not working!
Squidward: It's
