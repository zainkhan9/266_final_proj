[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible! I must have forgotten me office hours! [shuts the kitchen door.] Come back later! [goes to the cash register] There's a $5.00 discount!
[The cash register door opens and a lady comes in.]
Lady #1: Oh, delicious. Come in, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [takes her hat and puts it on her head] Good morning, ma'am.
[The lady gives Mr. Krabs a piece of her knickknacks. Mr. Krabs gasps in amazement.]
Lady #2: You stink!
Mr. Krabs: That's not what I meant!
Lady #2: It's not so bad, is it?
Mr. Krabs: Yes. [points to the cash register as he walks to the office] I gotta get over here. It's late today. I could use a nap.
[Mr. Krabs is having trouble getting over to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs. [gets spit on by the old lady] Gasp! Could this be the Krusty Krab? For years, I've dreamed of living in Bikini Bottom, Mr. Krabs. I'll turn you into a colorful old lady. [Spits SpongeBob back to Old Man Jenkins]
Mr. Krabs: What's that? I'm still in the embryonic stages of my genius.
SpongeBob: Ha-ha! [his head turns back to normal and he and Mr. Krabs get into a taxi] I hope I don't die of old Man Jenkins' disease this time. But I'll get through any one of us in a heartbeat.
[The taxi drives away.]
Mr. Krabs: [jumps onto the unconscious SpongeBob] Wait â€˜til I run down the street. Then I'll rule you all!
[He imagines himself in the colorful old man standing next to SpongeBob.]
Old Man Jenkins: [calling] King of Bikini Bottom! My people are here and looking pretty good!
[Suddenly, the street light turns red and SpongeBob screams. The scene changes to SpongeBob walking down the street with an old man tied around his back.]
SpongeBob: Old Man Jenkins? Oh, I've heard of this. Outsiders.Bad people. [Throws the old man on the ground]
Old Man Jenkins: I am Jenkins! I'm the new sheriff! Welcome to the streets of Bikini Bottom!
[The scene changes to Old Man Jenkins, SpongeBob, and the police officers surrounding SpongeBob. The old man is now holding a rope with a button attached to it.]
Old Man Jenkins: What they eat is sick! Oh, they are replaced with jewels.
SpongeBob: [takes notice of the rope] Look at them. I've been saying for years that I'm taking you behind the velvet strings of Bikini Bottom's Forever Warren!
Old Man Jenkins: Uh-huh.
[Officer John Slugfish comes by and steals the rope.]
Officer John Slugfish: You...re a felon.
SpongeBob: Uh...What are you a felon doing behind the velvet strings of Bikini Bottom's Forever Warren?
Old Man Jenkins: Mercuriality war, yes.
Officer John Slugfish: Let me see that. [Pulls the officer down and shows the rope to the officer] It's a $50 bill.
Officer John Slugfish: What?! Why, it's a lifesaver. [Takes the rope and holds it up]
SpongeBob: How many times do we have to tell you...
[Officer John Slugfish throws the rope? A crashing sound is heard. The officer screams in terror as he pummels the money into the ground and the officer's face. The officer is now spinning around in the spinning pummels back to SpongeBob. He turns around and his face appears beneath the $. The scene changes to SpongeBob looking at the new Mr. Krabs outfit the Pirate's Wife is wearing.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Mr. Krabs. What's new?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I can't tell you. But I can tell you that...That...Money-Driver is back in town. We've got to make sure he's not as obnoxious as he was before.
SpongeBob: Well, I did get to visit my old Wamp-time neighbors.
[SpongeBob notices Larry doing his washing out. He goes to wash his spatula, but runs into it and ricochets around it. He then gets a new spatula
