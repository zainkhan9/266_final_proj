[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is singing in the kitchen of the Krusty Krab while singing a very special tune.]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Ooh—www. Krabs-ellens, oh—www. Krabs-ellens, oh—www. Krabs-ellens, oh—www. Krabs-ellens, oh—www. Krabs-ellens, oh—�가가가, oh—��개가가, [normal voice] oh no. The spatulas are still coming and going. [to SpongeBob] You need to think fast. What do you think, buddy? P.S., SpongeBob needs these. [SpongeBob looks suspiciously at the guys]
Fish: Out of the way, SquarePants!
SpongeBob: Time for another treat. [sticks his hands in front of the spatula and pulls it aside, but the spatula goes in front of Squidward]
Harold: Make a wish, dear.
Professor Percy: To the Chum Bucket.
SpongeBob: My wish is to join the Chum Bucket.
Harold: Great! That's a lot of kickin' chum. I'll be right there.
Dr. Mundane: Good day, fellow employee of the year. I'm Dr. Mundane.
Dr. Mundane: I'm glad to be here, Professor Patrick is a card-carrying geezer.
Patrick: Hey, card-carrying?
Patrick: Oh, good morning, Geezer. I didn't think this was so hard. My name is Patrick Mundane, and I got married in less than twelve hours. I hope this chum comes off as a bit of a... bit of a... bit of a... bitter... womanizer. [stares at a part of the Chum Bucket] Wow. Much easier said than said.
Dr. Mundane: Oh, that's because you're not really married to chum. You're a very special, very special, very special chum chef. See? See, now?
Patrick: Uh, I don't think so.
Nathiel: See?
Patrick: Uh, I don't think so at all.
Nathiel: Oh, that I don't know! Anyway, your wish is my command, and your wish is my command's.
Patrick: Wow! A great plan. Well, I'm going to go this way, guys: We'll do it together. We'll call it: The Case of the Chum Stick.
[All of a sudden, the doorbell rings]
Patrick: Who's there?
SpongeBob: I can't see you.
Patrick: [gasps] I can't see me! My left eye is pinched and my right eye is chewed! [SpongeBob is kicked, then the door is kicked in the face. SpongeBob and Patrick are shown running]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [jumps on the door and kicks Patrick like a dog] I'm ready, I'm ready!
[Patrick is being chased by jellyfish [Jellyfish are shown chasing SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob is then seen chasing jellyfish]
Patrick: Come back! [Jellyfish beep backling] Oh, dear!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick! [the jellyfish spray SpongeBob and Patrick with] We're all out of here, man!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are then shown running in circles]
Patrick: Oh, no! I'm all out of here!
SpongeBob: Come on, guys! I'm all out of here. [They get on the ground and run behind Patrick] I'm all out of! I'm all out of here. I'm all out of here, all me! [They stop running] All me! [They run into the Chum Bucket, where Patrick is shown, and are out of] I'm all out of here? [angrily] All out of here? [chuckles] All out of me? [pus is shown in a bag, and is shown in a SpongeBob wig] All out of me?! [chuckles] I've been going about this all wrong. This is all very confusing.
Dr. Mundane: There you are, well, sir. May I now?
Patrick: I must have my mind all adjusted to correct, please.
Dr. Mundane: For your information, we shall return to our normal procedure.
Patrick: What are you trying to say?
Dr. Mundane: We are not accepting any form of information.
Patrick: What's that?
