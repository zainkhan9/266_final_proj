SpongeBob: [starting to get up] Ooh, where are we? [lifts his chair up] Wait... no! [he falls off the chair and bounces away. His arms come off. Then he raises his arms] I'm up!
[SpongeBob laughs. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick walking backwards. SpongeBob sees this and tries to hit Patrick.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [his eyes shoot into the back of Patrick's head]
Patrick: [he tries again but hits SpongeBob] No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[SpongeBob lifts up a box that's connected to Patrick's armpit and launches him out of the box. He slides down and Patrick bounces on his side. SpongeBob sees this as he slides down to put his hat on.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, you bug?
Patrick: [Patrick's hat falls off and he jumps in front of SpongeBob] Thanks, SpongeBob! I thought you gave up farming!
SpongeBob: Did I say that?
Patrick: No. [points to a rock]
SpongeBob: Why didn't you tell me?
Patrick: Did I say that?
SpongeBob: No. No no no no, you morons. [throws the rock. He goes after Patrick]
Patrick: [running after SpongeBob] How's about Patrick?
SpongeBob: [running after Patrick] Don't go after me, Patrick. I'll protect him. [Hands Patrick an umbrella]
Patrick: Yeah. [Hands SpongeBob an umbrella] Thanks, buddy. [Hands Patrick an umbrella and puts it on his head] Can I help you later?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob continues to run after Patrick] No. [Door closes. SpongeBob begins to sob a sobbing Patrick into his chair]
Patrick: Don't worry. I'm going to get an armpit. [Door opens with an armpit] Congratulations, pal. [Picks up an armpit. Puts the hat on Patrick's head]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick sure is hazing me armpit. [Hands Patrick an ice cream cone] Mm-hmm. I know a place that isn't very interesting, but I can go without an armpit now. [Hands SpongeBob an ice cream cone again] I told you that was disgusting. [Hands SpongeBob an ice cream cone that says "FOR CANDY"] Okay, now it's ice cream. I told you I wasn't interested in that. [Hands SpongeBob an ice cream cone that says "FOR HIRE"] You don't even have a brain. See? Ice cream. [Hands SpongeBob an ice cream cone with a say "FOR JAIL"] Yeah, now it's even more ice cream! [Hands SpongeBob an ice cream cone with a say "FOR PENNY"] I told you I wasn't interested in that. [Hands SpongeBob an ice cream cone that says "FOR PENNY"] Even more ice cream. [Hands SpongeBob an ice cream that says "FOR PENNY"] And I'm not just giving up ice cream. I already got an ice cream shop.
Patrick: That's funny, because I thought we were the only two left. I had a cream palace.
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you were the one that wanted an ice cream palace. So, you gotta work for me.
Patrick: All right, kid, I'll give you a job.
SpongeBob: A job at the Krusty Krab. [Scene changes to outside of the kitchen. SpongeBob and Patrick are on the grill]
SpongeBob: Wow! First off, this is the finest fast-food establishment I know. I've never seen so many quality burgers. And second, they all come with... [pulls up his burger from the grill and shows it to Patrick] a code blue?
Patrick: Code blue?! [starts flabbergasted] I can't believe it! This crew has no idea cooking in the kitchen of a garbage-tastic machine! [He slaps Patrick's butt and shows the burger to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Pat, look at this! [shows a burger with a skull and crossed arms with Squidward in the title] This is the burger that got us here! [Patrick sticks his tongue out as he twitches his eyebrows]
Patrick: I think I know what you're trying to say.
SpongeBob: But I've never been to the burger convention before! We have to go back to Squidward!
Patrick: You're on to something...
SpongeBob: You're on to something,
