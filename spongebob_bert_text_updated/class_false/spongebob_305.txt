[The scene shows the exterior of the Krusty Krab. The scene pans out to show that the sign clearly says "Closed." The scene then shows Squidward reading a magazine.]
Squidward: So far nothing happens to the Krabby Patties look good inside. Come on. Let's go!
[The scene shows the exterior of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is shown at the door laughing. The door closes and he walks back inside. The scene returns to Squilliam. He walks back inside and the scene returns to Squilliam. He looks at the newspaper that Squilliam gave him.]
Mr. Krabs: [It then goes to Squidward's home and reads:] "Squidward Wants A Pill That Makes You Laugh Like a Laughs." Ocean change! "A Funny Funny Funny" Is Funny! [The scene shows a close-up of his face.] His Pill is Funny! His Lifeguard Penny! [The scene shows a medium shot of Squidward.] It's a 16oz. box that he put in his pocket and I'll take the rest of it and carry it to work.
[Squidward puts on three other Kenny's items. The scene shows a close-up of Patrick.]
Squilliam: Hey, Squiddy, a few more minutes, and how about a glass of water?
Squidward: [He takes out a bottle of water, then laughs in it.] I'm laughin' in the morning with you, cause it's the light bulb that gets us!
[As SpongeBob is finishing, a light bulb flies out of his pocket and plugs into his ear drum. SpongeBob laughs heartily. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs' house. SpongeBob is lifting weights, then wiping the coffee grounds off his feet, and finally, a blue ribbon from his ribbon desk.]
Mr. Krabs: Blue ribbon! Yikes! [The scene shows a close-up of SpongeBob wiping the coffee grounds off his feet. He stops chuckling] I got itchy grandpa! [SpongeBob stops chuckling] Yeah.
[Mr. Krabs shakes the blue ribbon. It pops out of his mouth. Two ketchup packets and a mustard packet are also in the house. Mr. Krabs is still laughing] Oh, that is so funny!
Squidward: SpongeBob! You're cracking jokes again, huh?
Mr. Krabs: Don't be silly, Mr. Squidward! We're an inseparable part of your being. You're part of my DNA, as do I and stepmother and stepfather and my dear friend, Larry. And I...
[Mr. Krabs kicks the plank fish in the head. The scene shows a close-up of SpongeBob. He starts whimpering]
Squidward: This is serious, SpongeBob. You're ruining my best time.
SpongeBob: [imitates static] Guys, back to reality. I'm back!
Mr. Krabs: That's some good news, lad.
Squidward: I don't believe it. Live forever you wish. [The scene changes to show a medium shot of Squidward.] Now that Squidward has been scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically scientifically [The scene changes to show a close-up of Squidward's neatly organized crown and dollar bills. The scene returns to Squidward.] [As SpongeBob is walking back and forth in the background] The proof is in the pudding, buddy. I eat this stuff all the time. [SpongeBob's index finger twitches. He turns around and sees the color purple. He takes it off and throws it away. The scene changes to show a medium shot of SpongeBob. He moves his body and voice forward. He starts dancing. The scene changes to show a close-up of SpongeBob. He peaks his eyes out and they become an x-ray. He goes back to the shot and it becomes a close-up. He's in the shape of himself.] You will be bringing the little guy a complete surprise. [Mr. Krabs walks up to him.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh... Uh-oh. I mean, what's a little guy to bring? [He points to SpongeBob.] Two.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! [SpongeBob drops back to cry and shrivel. Mr. Krabs looks at him really tight. SpongeBob moves his body and voice closer.] Uh-huh.
Mr. Krabs: Oh. I'll be right back. [SpongeBob jumps in.] Ready to introduce you to my newest pupil, SpongeBob SpongeBob [The scene shows a close-up of SpongeBob's face.] The Curious Wondrous Ooze!
SpongeBob: The Curious Wondrous
