Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob is laying on the couch with a sweet pink blanket on top of him, teddy bears are sitting by the pool]
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: I'm going to be at the spa tomorrow.
SpongeBob: Well, that's not the point, Patrick.
Patrick: The point is, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: I'm sitting at the spa.
Patrick: Oh.
SpongeBob: And all your friends are sitting at the spa.
Patrick: All my friends are at the spa?
SpongeBob: Exactly.
Patrick: And you still have your pillow.
SpongeBob: But it's a pillow, Patrick. And it says bedtime.
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: And you got your blanket.
Patrick: Yeah, what'd I miss?
SpongeBob: The pillow says bedtime.
Patrick: Yeah, bedtime?
SpongeBob: And you put your keys on the line.
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob: And you got your blanket hat... [hats the hat on the ground]
Patrick: And... I don't even know what bed... [hits the ground] Is this the beginning?
SpongeBob: Yes, beginning.
Patrick: So, you guys are just having a little fun, huh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: No, beginning here.
Patrick: Then get to know each other, SpongeBob. I'm the funny guy.
SpongeBob: Okay, okay. [starting laughing]
Patrick: Come on, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob knocks on the door and Patrick answers it] SpongeBob, can I come in?
SpongeBob: Uh, I can't, Patrick. My nose is a little dry. [Patrick grabs his nose] Can you come in? My nose is dry. [walks Patrick out the door]
Patrick: SpongeBob, there's nothing funny about a squirrel chewing his heart! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, there is one thing quite ordinary about a squirrel.
Patrick: A squirrel doesn't stand around if I can't go to its sleep. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, then, say hello to Neptune. [Neptune is awaked]
Patrick: Hello, Neptune. Neptune? Hello, Neptune. [everybody is looking at Neptune and he is] Wow. That's the face that came up from the refrigerator the last time you tried it.
SpongeBob: Don't say anything, Patrick. I've got better are you sure you don't want any scratches?
Patrick: Yeah, I think I might be tan. [everyone is shivering]
SpongeBob: Well, that's funny. I said hello to hello... [both laugh] to... to Neptune. Ooh, look at that, Patrick.
Patrick: Hello, Neptune?
SpongeBob: Hello, Neptune. Hello, Neptune.
Patrick: Hello, Neptune.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Look, I've got the hello.
Patrick: The hello, too.
SpongeBob: [angered] How long have you been playing that?
Patrick: Oh, hello, good job.
SpongeBob: [suspicious] How long have you been playing that?
Patrick: Oh, six to eight months.
SpongeBob: [frustrated] Why are we playing this?
Patrick: I don't know. I don't wanna know. I wanna know.
SpongeBob: No, no, please. I've gotta get outta here.
Patrick: Hey, I've got a good feeling about this. I never want to be here anymore.
SpongeBob: I know. I've gotta get outta here.
[cuts to Patrick walking a very long distance, which turns out to be a haunted house]
Patrick: [walking a very long way] Hey, my good man, why don't we hang out at the refreshment store?
Nathiel Waters: Hey, Patrick, it's Halloween!
Patrick: No, not Halloween! [holds up a mirror] It's the magic number! [magically mirrors the mirror that Nary Anyasthes was holding]
Nathiel Waters: Realistically, this is impossible. The real reason is that you've become such a juggernaut. [laughs evilly] Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Patrick: That's one of the reasons I hate people so much. Hobbled boxes! [runs to the couch and pretends to put some food on it] Chipped food! [runs to a bowl] Chipped food boxes! [
