[scene transitions to the Krusty Krab]
[inside the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, Squidward.
Squidward: I figured out how to make myself some...
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing in my restaurant, stupid?
Squidward: I brought my own fork. [Mr. Krabs takes it and goes to make a new one]
Pilar: And my old fork.
Mr. Krabs: And how's that for your old fork? [the old fork falls to the ground and Mr. Krabs picks it up]
Pilar: You just dropped a fork.
Mr. Krabs: Never have.
Pilar: You some kind of moron?
Mr. Krabs: I am so very, very sorry, Pilar. I made a lot of money.
Squidward: Making money was my life ever since I was a baby.
Mr. Krabs: And now I'm trying to raise me glass to the world, Squidward!
[Squidward's face appears on the glass]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here, sir?
Mr. Krabs: I came here to live and raise me glass to the world. That I'm sure you'll understand.
SpongeBob: Why, you suppose I can help explain. [looks through the menu and rejects the idea]
Mr. Krabs: I like you, boy. You like me very, very, very much. [shows a picture of a Krabby Patty on his wall] When I saw you was going to live here with his spatula, I either worked with him to make it happen or youd-dried him into a ball of tweedles [looks at the tweedles on the spatula's wall] and run-footed around in his attempt to pull out the mustard.
SpongeBob: [in his pajamas, wearing a diaper, and holding a jar of mustard] Mr. Krabs, you destroyed me!!!!
[SpongeBob screams and runs away]
SpongeBob: [at the Krusty Krab, where there is a line] Good thing I know of the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: That's me boy, Mr. Squidward! How are we getting through this ruckus without nitwitting? [SpongeBob is in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: I came here to live and raise me little little star. But nothing in the whole Krusty Krab resembles living like a sea-level oncologist. [SpongeBob runs in] We've got to get rid of him, boy.
SpongeBob: Hey, I'll do it or be shot! [does the cutest thing] Oh, vituper tecum [throws the tomato at Mr. Krabs] ... wig me away! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [shuts the door] Go away, buddy. You'll be back in business as usual.
[cut to Mr. Krabs hanging his tie by a rope line]
Mr. Krabs: You will? [shuts it on SpongeBob] And you better not be late tomorrow. [SpongeBob slides out of the window and behind SpongeBob on a rack] You got the poor kid. [SpongeBob jumps and falls on the ground, while Mr. Krabs uses a metal detector to look for SpongeBob] You better not be late today. [SpongeBob jumps up out of the way] I told you that looked really good. [SpongeBob looks for a second at Mr. Krabs. He misses him and he hits the metal detector with the tie, causing it to break, causing damage, and a robot to come fall down as Mr. Krabs tries to escape] You better not be late today. [SpongeBob jumps into the air with Mr. Krabs under him, and falls right in front of SpongeBob] I knew you were alive, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs' eyes bug out] Well, not really. [Mr. Krabs gets out of SpongeBob's head again] Yeah, good luck with that. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what's wrong?
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, I could of talked Squidward into joining me.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, no, no, no! [Mr. Krabs bangs on the computers as they chase him around trying to catch him. He backs up] Wait a minute, he's not doing it!
Mr. Krabs: He's doing it?
SpongeBob: No, he
