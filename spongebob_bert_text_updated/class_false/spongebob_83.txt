[At the Krusty Krabâ€¦]
Mr. Krabs: Krabs, what do I owe them the whole bag of Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Everything.
SpongeBob: You want me to get you a new bag?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, whatever.
SpongeBob: All gone. [takes SpongeBob's money]
Mr. Krabs: Heh. Finally. 
[The scene changes to SpongeBob walking to the Krusty Krab again.]
SpongeBob: I gotta go get my bag.
Mr. Krabs: All right. Hey, SpongeBob, you want me to meet your buddy, you know? [gives SpongeBob his hat]
SpongeBob: All right. Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [gets in his boat, drives away, and then stops] And a nice warm Krabby Patty for your sake. 
Mr. Krabs: [puts the patty in his cash register and then his nose. Then he opens the cash register and reads it] "This item has the capacity to move, despite the presence of patties."
SpongeBob: "Because it has the capacity to move?"
Mr. Krabs: [getting angry] C'mon, c'mon. Just 'cause you have notp'd one tile of tile on your screen doesn't mean you can't move it. 
SpongeBob: Oh, sir, can I get a little help? [Mr. Krabs pushes him back] Too little? 
[cuts to a real-life sponge]
Plankton: Uh-oh. [he walks up to a plain blue sponge] Behold, the stench of failure! All it took was a little voice on my little voice microphone. It was Mrs. Puff! She was just starting to get it.
Spongy: [laughs]
Plankton: So, what's a basic handshake?
Spongy: As in, "Please take me in your arms?" [he slaps me, meows, and I shoves him right in the center of the screen] How kind, silly sponge?
Plankton: Good question. SpongeBob's been kind enough to save my productivity. I can't do it without you, silly.
Spongy: [he coughs and goes back to hugging me] I guess I'll never get another job with him again. [cut to SpongeBob and Plankton walking through the Krusty Krab] Here's the handshake. It has gotten my sanity back to where I belong. [laughs] It's made me more productive. [laughs] Now I just chill with my creative genius. Or, you could whip me up some punch. [cuts to a man on a surfboard] Pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, pointy, there's only one more thing I want to ask you.
Spongy: Uh-oh.
Plankton: Say what?
Spongy: Uh, your sacred jellyfishing net.
Plankton: [shakes his head] Uh-oh.
Spongy: I wanna put on my show. [cuts to SpongeBob at the kitchen table, wearing a SpongeBob hat and holding a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Whatever. Just say hi to her. [cuts back to the man who gave Plankton the Krabby Patty]
Man: Hi.
Plankton: Hi, SpongeBob. [knocks on door]
SpongeBob: Hey, Man, you saved my life.
Plankton: I saved it, SpongeBob, I learned your lesson, sir. [knocks on door again]
SpongeBob: I'm trying to be helpful, Man, don't be selfish. [chuckles] I need help sometimes.
Man: Help? Oh, I think you've learned your lesson. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Uh, I was going through a juncture in my career where I was forced to take care of children. When I was asked how I did that, I said, "through a juncture in my career".
Plankton: That's the way you do it, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: That's what I do?care of children?
Plankton: Well, that's been around for a long time now. I'm a caretaker, remember?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Plankton: Well, if you don't want to have to take the cookie away, why then do you serve me
