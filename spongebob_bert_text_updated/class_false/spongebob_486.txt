<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Patrick are hitting a plastic cup with a conch shell. Patrick kicks it, SpongeBob gets squished and falls over. He plays with the conch shell, changes, and puts sand in it, while he makes whistles and the like. Then he comes back down and squirts air in SpongeBob's holes.]
SpongeBob: Hi, guys.
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob squirts more air in the holes and Patrick falls over. They both grab each other and start to shake. Eventually, SpongeBob and Patrick get tired of playing and falls off. They continue in and SpongeBob holds both of his antennae.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Is there a finale?
Patrick: I don't know.
Both: [laugh]
[SpongeBob squirts more air in the holes and Patrick falls off. They both float to where the power goes out and the episode ends.]
