[It is night time at the Krusty Krab. Squidward is having a relaxing evening with a cappuccino. Mr. Krabs and Squidward are walking down the street.]
Mr. Krabs: Ahâ€¦ [notices sudsing the cashier boat] Huh? The cup isn't here. What's this? [pushes the cash register boat out of the way]
[Mr. Krabs gets caught in the spinning tablesafe and gets crushed by the sudsing money. Plankton, who is being held against the dialing machine, screams in horror. He is then interrupted by the enormous hand holding Squidward's money. Plankton is pulled away with the huge umbilical cord dangling from the cord. Squidward is then shown holding and pinching his missing organ while chattering.]
Mr. Krabs: Y-You see? This ain't the Krusty Krab. They wanted me Mr. Krabs. Oh, boy! I'll be back. [scene cuts to Squidward in the diner] Mr. Krabs, I finally got myself a job. I can be myself. [scene cuts to SpongeBob outside] After work, we go to work. We don't mind if we don't like Squidward. [SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Good one, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: No, no learning without doing. No learning without doing.
SpongeBob: Aw, you're teaching without doing...
Squidward: Can't... You Assert My Right to Know? [begging] Just Do What You Are Doing.
SpongeBob: Then who is that?
Squidward: [at the counter] He is the teacher.
SpongeBob: Hey, isn't that right, Mr. Krabs?
Squidward: [groans] Don't push me, Mr. Krabs. Just be the sponge. [shoves SpongeBob in his mouth]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs. I realize this is a stressful day, but you are the sponge!
Harold: Just do what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Huh?
Harold: Do what?
SpongeBob: Huh! [takes out a dildo]
Harold: Do what?
SpongeBob: Hmm-mm-mm. [shoves butt inside dildo]
Harold: Do what?
SpongeBob: Hmm-mm-mm. [pops his head out the dildo]
Harold: Do what?
SpongeBob: Hmm-mm-mm. [pops his head]
[Cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is working. SpongeBob is blowing on the cash register while Harold is juggling Krabby Patties. Fred is doing table dance and plays clarinet. Tom is having fun on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, who's responsible for this? [SpongeBob blows to attention and strikes a pose, holding a spatula and club and splintered carrot in the air. Flashback to Mr. Krabs holding a spatula and club. SpongeBob makes a 'take' pose, but stops when the spatula and club fall off. SpongeBob tries to fight back tears, but he falls over. He grabs the club and tears it up, then bounces off. He goes over to the table, and falls over too. He then falls back to the table and falls onto SpongeBob holding a plate of Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Aww, tartar sauce tastes better. [sets plate on the ground and laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's just me.
[Cut to later in the day at the Krusty Krab. Fred is doing pushups in Jellyfishing's weight boat. Sally is doing pushups in her Kelp-O.]
Squidward: Let's do it again.
[Squidward reaches for the plate and gets splattered in the face. He gets up. The plate is full of jelly.]
Squidward: Yuck!
Mr. Krabs: Hey, I wasn't kicking anyone's invertebrate for a ride on the microscopic? The answer is NO! [He shows him the plate.] And this! [shows him the plate with the word "trampoline" on it. Squidward takes it off] This is a ride! This is about as fancy a thing as you can imagine! [He picks it up and puts it back on. Mr. Krabs is grinning. SpongeBob pops out of SpongeBob's house.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, [shows him the plate] it's YOU!
Squidward: [confused] What?
