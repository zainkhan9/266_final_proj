[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick taking a nature hike.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be so boring. [starts walking outside when a thud is heard from the top.] Uh, is that gonna attract more fish?
Patrick: [silence] I'm afraid not. Clams come for pleasure, SpongeBob. [points to the sky filled with mud; a fish walks up and picks up SpongeBob] There she is. Her name is SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: [shakes his head slowly] Patrick, the sky is flatter than you think.
Patrick: I've never been here this dark before. Is that too much to expect?
SpongeBob: [smacks his head around] Uh, no, I guess so.
Patrick: [leans closer to SpongeBob] You're close, little square.
SpongeBob: [angrily] Great idea, Patrick! Carry on, carry on, carry on!
[As Patrick walks off, a mussel hog pops up in the middle of the path and eats SpongeBob. The mussel hog growls after it, and SpongeBob and Patrick hide in each other's legs.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Huh? [a female mussel hog bites SpongeBob and Patrick's pants]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasps] Huh? [notices the female hog]
SpongeBob: Is that you, Mrs. Gare?
Mrs. Garen: Never heard of it! Oh, this is a very bad idea. I do not want to have to deal with this again. [takes off her bathing suit] This time, I'm going to make sure it's safe! [takes off her bathing suit] Greetings, fellow sponge. [the female hog lets out a huge x-ray and re-appears in SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob and Patrick are paralyzed from the waist up]
Patrick: That was close. [puts on swimwear]
SpongeBob: You did a great job, Mrs. Garen. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace which I will wear while you sweat it out. [walks off]
Mrs. Garen: SpongeBob, time for beddy-bye night. [walks up to SpongeBob] I know you're in there, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Who? [Mrs. Garen presses a button on the control panel]
Mrs. Garen: Under what control?
SpongeBob: Uh, it's this. I pressed that button to control the oxygen tank on the diving board.
Mrs. Garen: That's it, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I know it or it's not there. [inflates himself, causing the control panel to turn red-hot] I know it or it's not there! [exclaims]
Mrs. Garen: SpongeBob, are you alright? [spits SpongeBob a pearl] Oh, there you are! [flicks SpongeBob a few times and it's gone] I wonder what caused that dialing thingy to go haywire.
SpongeBob: Oh, Mrs. Garen, it's perfectly normal. I always gear up for the remote. If I don't start opening up my drawers, I'm dead.
Mrs. Garen: Dead or not, you are... dead?
SpongeBob: That's what I say.
Mrs. Garen: Nobody goes running... without a little work of genius. [shows SpongeBob some clothes] What little you got, alright. [you twirl it around a head and it disappears] That's what you think, but I got you covered. [you put a blanket over the sink and turn on the lights] Make room for your loveseat. [you put a tablecloth over the sink and the lights go out] There you are. [you put arm arms and legs together and laugh. Mrs. Garen takes it upon herself to feed SpongeBob. SpongeBob digs himself through the hole and comes out through the kitchen window with the sock on his head.]
SpongeBob: Found it! [wormish-looks and looks around] Hey, Mrs. Garen, is there a computer center in town?
Mrs. Garen: Oh, a loveseat for the poor little guy. [wormish-looks and looks around] I've got one of those fancy new office furniture you get to fix up yourself.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Garen. I've got a little trouble getting the electrical system working again. [evil-looking and looks around] Do you have anything else planned for tonight, Mrs. Garen?
Mrs. Garen: Oh, just the night shift
