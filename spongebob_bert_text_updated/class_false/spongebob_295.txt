Octopus leader: Get down! Get your arms! Get down! Get em! [Squidward puts his arm on the microphone and starts to cry, but then Squilliam puts his arm on the microphone again and starts to cry]
Squilliam: I can't listen to you, son.
Squidward: Son?
Squilliam: That's not what I meant!
Squidward: [laughs] Okay, get it together, SQUIDward. What was your point?
Octopus leader: Get down! Get your arms!
Squidward: What?
Octopus leader: Adrenalin rush!
Squidward: What?
Octopus leader: Scream!
Squidward: What?
Octopus leader: Eat me!
Octopus leader: Drink me!
Squidward: I don't have any food left!
Octopus leader: In cans! See?!
Squidward: Look, all this is my fault. I'm just trying to help people. All that was meant to be is for their good. So, if you see that by some miracle, youre a monster... [everyone starts to cry] Then there's nothing to worry about.
SpongeBob: Well, I guess that explains why he's crying so much. [Squidward starts to cry] Why.
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: That was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
Squidward: Well, let's forget about that for a second. [then, the Chum Bucket gets wrecked]
Plankton: Cost, kid.
Squidward: Oh, yeah? Well, here it goes. [Screams. After a few seconds, he flies away. Then, he gets smashed to the ground]
Pearl: Uh, I don't see it.
Squidward: I see it. Squidward, that was some miracle you requested, and it destroyed the Chum Bucket! [Squidward gets smashed to the ground again]
Pearl: Well, that was a bunch of... you mean lines. lines!
Squidward: Look, Pearl, thank you for this. Let's just go home.
[Squidward plucks his hair]
Pearl: Uh, I don't think he meant that.
SpongeBob: I don't see lines.
Squidward: Oh, don't be afraid of them. They go back at once. At this rate, we'll have a winner in ten years.
SpongeBob: [whispers to Pearl] Don't worry, Pearl.
Squidward: I'm not the only one who's worried. [all excited] Fourteen competitors coming up! I better start feeling nervous!
[At dawn, SpongeBob and Pearl are napping at their Krusty Krab desk.]
SpongeBob: Let's roll. [notices Pearl asleep] Aw, Pearl. Huh, a clock. Pearl must be dreaming. [SpongeBob grabs his head and goes to look at his clock. Pearl wakes up and starts to shiver. SpongeBob walks over] Pearl! Oh, Pearl. You're early today, sir.
Pearl: Yes, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: How's walking today, Pearl?
Pearl: Great, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [turns to a calendar] Plans for the daycare go this instant!
Pearl: I don't know, SpongeBob. When they get a jump on a little parade, they really dig themselves.
SpongeBob: [breaks calendar off the floor] Yay.
Pearl: [screams] Some idiot is digging in my yard!
SpongeBob: Ah, Pearl. You woke me up. Oh, hi, Pearl. Pearl, you're digging in my yard?
Pearl: I'm, uh...no, I'm not. [Pearl breaks off the gardening supplies she is using to plant corned beef] I haven't had my corned beef yet, so I'm only gonna have the seeds.
SpongeBob: No, Pearl. Don't make any noise. I am not going to dig in enemy hands' yards. Not in Pearl's yards. Huh?
Pearl: No, SpongeBob. Don't go moister around my yard. Not at me. [Pearl breaks apart and grabs her rival, SpongeBob] Oh, SpongeBob... [SpongeBob grabs Pearl's rival, another sponge] Give me my corned beef! [another pile of corned beef falls on them] Me SpongeBob, dig me some grave. [another pile of bones lands on them] So, are you ready for nap time?
SpongeBob: I can't do it
