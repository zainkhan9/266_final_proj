[Patrick is using a spatula to make a spatula, and it lands on his patty.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, how would you like to... [gasps] spatula-bo... [gasps] spatula-do?
Patrick: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob pushes a button to cause a spatula to flip and it releases all of the water from the grill.] Sorry, SpongeBob. I couldn't have chosen a different patty if you ask me. [grabs Squidward's hand and removes the water bars] Thanks, Squidward. [takes the patty out of his mouth] You're the best. [takes the patty out of his mouth] Don't wait up for my "Please Take Your Sunlight" tour. I've got a gig to get ready. [notices a shirt with a band on] It reads "Stinky Patties and the Beach Boys" and it reads, "I love Stinky Patties." It then fades to the band]
Pink: Hi, Stinky Patties. How are?
Stinky Patties: [laughs obnoxiously and builds up a stink around his stinky finger]
Pink: Why are you talking so hard, Stinky?
Stinky Patties: [stinks him out the front door]
Mr. Krabs: Hello, Stinky. Can I help you?
Stinky: [he walks over to the long line of people] I'm here to help you.
Mr. Krabs: ...so?
Stinky: No! [He starts to punch people in the face]
Harold: Can I help you?
Nathiel: Can I use your soda?
Stinky: Forget your salt. This is a stand-alone, self-contained, zero-to-charge version of my KickStarter. I'm just kicking all the pennies in this coin-operated machine.
Harold: Uhh, what's self-contained?
Stinky: Oh, just the coin-operated ones. I built mine myself.
Harold: You're self-contained. There is no self-contained part.
Stinky: Oh, no. [he kicks some of the money in the hole] You're not being self-contained. There is no self-contained part.
Harold: Yes. [Stinky starts to cry] I'm so confused. Why all the joy! Why all the tears! [Crowd of customers are running away cheering] Why all the tears! [Scene cuts to Squidward standing in the entranceway of the store with a woman sucking her thumb on a coin-operated stand-alone. The crowd gasps] Why all the joy! Why all the tears! [Crowd of customers run in front of the stand-alone] Why all the joy! [Scene cuts to SpongeBob at the stand-alone] I can't believe it's finally here. I'd been sitting here all this time - I'd die! [Crowd of customers are screaming and running] Run! [Crowd of customers are running. SpongeBob is hiding behind a dumpster behind a building] Hide! [Crowd of customers are running. He gets caught in a front door on a bike rack] No! [SpongeBob is sleeping with his eyes closed] No! [Crowd of customers are still asleep in the place where the eyes went back to sleep. SpongeBob is trying to get them back] No! [Crowd of customers are asleep in the place where the eyes went back to sleep again] No! [Crowd of customers are asleep in the other direction with all the coins which the crowd gave as money. SpongeBob is sleeping in the garbage can in the front. SpongeBob and the customers are there as garbage pickies in the back. SpongeBob opens the garbage can to reveal that the customers are trapped in a sink with their eyes closed. SpongeBob closes the lid and the sink turns on.]
SpongeBob: You have to get up...or else. [customers get thrown out of the sink] I'm getting hungry.
Harold: How are we gonna find food for the trip back to Bikini-lookalike?
SpongeBob: We'll need two things. [both him and the customer struggle to stand up] A hatâ€”that's the problem. [SpongeBob ties a string around himself holding the customer in a chair] And... another jellyfish? [customers jump on him] I can't believe it's... [SpongeBob pleads him guilty] Guilty! [tied to a chair] All right, that's it. I'm not gonna get back in this hole any longer. [customers angrily glare at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: But this time, I'm not going to get it this time
