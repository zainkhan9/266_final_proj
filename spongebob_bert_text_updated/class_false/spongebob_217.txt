[episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick walking on water]
SpongeBob: Huh? [gasps] Ooh. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. [Patrick stops and SpongeBob does not stop to breathe]
Patrick: I'm air-testing the air. [SpongeBob turns the air tank on and Patrick's face turns into SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob looks down at his face and realized it was not Patrick's face. He got an idea as he slowly raises up his head to Patrick's face and looked at Patrick's face]
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you air-testing me, too?
Patrick: Yes. [points to his tank] And the air is aching.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm just air-testing me to see how it's warming up.
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm just...
Patrick: [Starts flushing toilet] SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you sure, buddy?
Patrick: [Looks at toilet and wipes his forehead] Yep. I'll take that as will my whole army.
SpongeBob: All right. [Squidward comes in] Welcome to the army! You're just in time for the grand unveiling of a new comedy television show! I'm proud to be a guest-starting the show!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, the show's about ideas, not rules!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I'm talking about your brilliant idea for the television! I'm going to make it alright, by the way, why don't you give it a try?
Patrick: Great idea, SpongeBob. [hands SpongeBob a pencil] Now look at this. It's a rectangle. [shows the land around him that has the show's name and the camera zooms in on it] It displays the show's most beloved episode. [shows the image on the screen] Uh oh. [okay with a bow] Perhaps this will show off my most beloved invention. [puts the pencil in front of SpongeBob] The crown of my new proud invention. [shakes it]
SpongeBob: It's a little machine. [presses a button on it]
Patrick: Wait a minute. It's a little thing? [takes it] Oh, boy, the brainstorming muscles! I've got something totally different for you! A gigantic coffee mug! [presses a button on it]
SpongeBob: Great, Patrick. Now what could I do with some Gil-key's for my mind? [takes a mug of raw Krabby Patties]
Patrick: Raw Krabby Patties?!
SpongeBob: Oh, just the one I need.
Patrick: Oh, oh, oh! I've got it! [pushes the counter and grabs two Krabby Patties]
SpongeBob: Patrick, where are you? [sees a bunch of ones around]
Patrick: Oh, come on. Let's go find that and I'll charge you. [presses a button on the mug]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. One Krabby Patty. Go ahead. [presses another button and gets five more Krabby Patties]
Patrick: More Krabby Patties! [presses more buttons]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. One Krabby Patty. Come on, help me get those patties to me. [pushes a button and gets the other one]
Patrick: [pushes a button while saying "I Love You"] I will never get those patties! [throws away the patties and picks up SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: But... but why?
Patrick: Well, because it was your idea!
SpongeBob: Why did you give me your recipe?
Patrick: I wanted to make something, too.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Sure.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Why?
SpongeBob: I didn't even know what your idea was.
Patrick: [laughs] Really?! Why?! [Patrick starts growling at his friend]
SpongeBob: Well, I was starting to think your Krabby Patty thingens out.
Patrick: [laughs] Wrong. Krabby Patty! [throws the patty into SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: I don't want to be a burden! [laughs]
