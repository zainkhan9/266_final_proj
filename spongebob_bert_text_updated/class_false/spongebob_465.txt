[A note from the Chum Bucket reads "The Chum Bucket". It starts with the words "The Chum Bucket". It jumps to the Chum Bucket's picture, where it reads, "The Chum Bucket".]
Her name is Cherish. [Cherish starts eating Krabby Patties, which is an Old-Hand reading "Krabby Patties!".]
Old-Hand: One Krabby Patty, please.
SpongeBob: Ahem! [Old-Hand eats Krabby Patties, Old-Hand holds up a sandwich, and Old-Hand's nose is covered in cheese]
Old-Hand: [Whacks Old-Hand with her spatula, who is covered in meat] Ta-da! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up, excited] I've been looking for this moment since me nose started growing.
SpongeBob: [Whacks himself with his nose] I've never been excited before.
Patrick: Do you hear that?
Old-Hand: What?
SpongeBob: I've been nervous for a long time now, so I thought it was your idea. [Old-Hand stuffs a piece of meat in his mouth and secures it with his tongue]
New-Hand: [Eats a patty, who eats it, then spits it out] Grr! [The scene cuts to a TV with a title tag that reads "Krabby Patties"!]
Larry: [singing] Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Krabby Patties! Krabby Patties!
Larry: Oh, welcome to the Krusty Krab. You don't even have a K-1198 license plate.
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, welcome. I am!
Patrick: Oh, welcome. I am, too. [both laugh as Larry walks out]
SpongeBob: Welcome to the Krusty Krab, do you think?
Larry: Yes, sir. [Larry narrows his eyes, revealing some horror, then laughs out loud. The customers clap their hands in the air, and then back to normal, ending the episode] While I was away, you skipped ahead to the kitchen of the finest kitchen in all of Krabs' Expats Lodge!
Fred: Excuse me, can I get some ice?
Larry: Hold on, hold on, hold on. That newscast is supposed to show the lives of real K-1198 and K-1199, not fancy, sock-flavored ice cream.
SpongeBob: Oh, I can put up with that now.
Larry: Ice cream.
SpongeBob: Yeah, maybe a Krabby Patty will help.
Larry: Yeah, maybe he won't.
SpongeBob: He can help with that wacky little ice cream thing.
Larry: [holds onto his spatula] He can help with that wacky little ice cream thing!
SpongeBob: He can help with that wacky little ice cream thing! [suddenly gets an ice cream made out of his fingers]
Larry: Hey, wait a minute, SpongeBob. That's not ice cream! That's ice cream! [Larry takes an ice cream cone and makes it into a phone. SpongeBob, on the other hand, screams and runs around]
SpongeBob: Uh, hey, Larry. Hey, Larry. I got a suggestion. Call me? [Larry follows, laughing, until SpongeBob gets himself formed]
Larry: I'm not Larry, this is obscene.
SpongeBob: But it's better than the Krusty Krab, eh Larry?
Larry: Yeah, yeah, I know Larry's tastes. And I don't just mean the taste buds of small business owners like you. I mean the taste buds of everybody who follows the Krusty Krab oath.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, thanks for inviting me to join your lodge.
Larry: Never mind. Let's make something good!
SpongeBob: Really?
Larry: Sure. Let's start with some sitting and lace this up. [places a tea bag underneath and SpongeBob sits] Ooh. This is going to be good.
SpongeBob: Good sitting.
Larry: And you can put this a-okay. [places a denture on his left leg] Ooh. This is nice. And you put this one in a tea bag. [Larry places a black lace tea bag on top] This is great. [Larry places a tea bag into SpongeBob's mouth to make it gong] This is great. I can say without exaggeration that I have seen more gold in a bowl of lace than diamonds. [Larry places another lace tea bag in SpongeBob's mouth, but it
