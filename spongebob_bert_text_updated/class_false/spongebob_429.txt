[The episode starts with SpongeBob walking home while sipping a drink.]
SpongeBob: [as he writes] ♪La la la la la la la la la. Hey, girl! Let's go to the park and get some sunscreen.♪ [bumps into Mrs. Puff's boat] ♪I'm so tired! I'm so tired! I'm so tired!♪ [driving] ♪Now I'm tired, too!♪ [cuts to outside, where Mrs. Puff is riding her bike and screaming] ♪Now I'm exhausted! I want to do lots of things at once! Things that are very, very, very, very, very tired!♪ [bus stops next to her and stops for a second. Mrs. Puff whimpers and starts sobbing again. Cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is trying to get into the kitchen, but the kitchen window slams the kitchen door on him. Cut to Mrs. Puff with her tongue sticking out, talking very loudly, possibly a very loudly person] ♪Now I'm very tired! I want to do lots of things at once! They are: bath breaks, house decorations, even, I could go to the park.♪ [bus stops at the park and Mrs. Puff looks very tired] ♪Then I would like to come to the park and bathe in the softness and the fresh.♪ [bus leaves] 
Mrs. Puff: ♪Then I would like to go to the park and get some of that soft fun stuff that is so...so...--♪ [bus then suddenly stops, leaving a hole in the roof] 
SpongeBob: ♪Then I would like to get a pet laser eye andro-atomic clock to tune up my daily progressions.♪ [talking very loudly] ♪Then I would like to have a minor miracle of minor miracle.♪ [talking very loudly again] ♪Then I would like to have the nose of the most powerful being in the universe, spin it around and make it go back where it came.♪ [talking very loudly again] ♪Then I would like to have the universe's most powerful being buried in the sand.♪ [talking very loudly again] ♪Then I would like to have the laws of the universe changed!♪ [talking very loudly] ♪Then I would like to have the universe's most powerful being shrunk!♪ [talking very loudly] ♪Then I would like to have the universe's most powerful being pieced together!♪ [talking very loudly] ♪Then I would like to have the universe's most powerful being pieced together!♪ [talking very loudly] ♪Now I will give you everything you've ever wanted!♪ [bus stops at the park and then it stops again. Mrs. Puff very tired]
Mrs. Puff: ♪Now I will make you what you wanted for all of summer!♪ [ SpongeBob walks out of the kitchen with tea and cup soap in his hands. He grabs the cup and the soap flushes out of his hand. He then walks back into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Mrs. Puff! It's really hot in here!
Mrs. Puff: ♪It's all hot!♪ [She then gets really angry and steam comes out of the tea set. She then walks back into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: I thought this was a garden-variety restaurant. I thought it had something else in mind. [He starts to walk out of the kitchen, but Mrs. Puff stops him]
Mrs. Puff: What? Oh, I can't. I have work to do! [SpongeBob slithers to the door] I've got time! [The door goes in and Mrs. Puff has to open it. SpongeBob then jumps in the air with his skirt on top of his head. He gets in front of the door] Mrs. Puff! Shall I ever do my hair, master? [SpongeBob stares at the two, then starts to type] ♪What do you want with me?♪ [SpongeBob tries to say something, but Mrs. Puff stops him.]
Mrs. Puff: What? Oh, no! [She gets out of the SpongeBob's and runs in front of the door] I've got to get a first-degree green friend a free lunch.
SpongeBob: I'm so sorry, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: No time for tendery! [she grabs a rope and begins to rope him with it] Are you sure you don't want tender with this?
SpongeBob: I'll toss it in the trash.
