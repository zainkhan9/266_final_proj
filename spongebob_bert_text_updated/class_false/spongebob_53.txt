[At a catering kitchen, Mr. Krabs goes up to the barbequed lawn and knocks on the register. There is a knock on the door and Plankton is there.]
Plankton: Yes, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Can I help you?
Plankton: Can I? Oh, yes.
Mr. Krabs: Can I help you? I can't. Why not?
Plankton: Why not at all?
Mr. Krabs: I like you. What can I do for you?
Plankton: Nothing, I just remembered you asked.
Mr. Krabs: I like you, nothing ever stays the same. You shouldn't be on the menu.
Plankton: All right, I'll have you on the ground immediately. [Mr. Krabs pulls Plankton] Mind if I take a second to tell you what a lovely face it is, lowly dunderhead?
Karen: Hello, easily one of my least favorite things to do.
Plankton: Well, I shall have you on the ground, my rod and I be exact.
Karen: [slams the door] Phew! That's a relief.
Plankton: Now what would that be?
Karen: The um... ahâ€¦ you know.
Plankton: Sorry I couldn't hear you over the intercom.
Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the kitchen] Don't worry Plankton, I got a proposition. ["An offer". Starts making a racket of Mr. Krabs' office. Mr. Krabs puts cards in every box he enters] And now I'll get you a very nice and quick life-long friend, just for the joy of it. Hey, who are you talking to, Plankton? ["Plankton"] Who are you, and what's up with the Kelp-O-Plab crew?
Plankton: Life is good, Krabs. Just stick to what I say.
Mr. Krabs: That's a hoot, Plankton.
Plankton: Really? I was just gonna ask you a different question, but you just stick to what I say. [rips off his fake microphone] What do you say, Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What do you say? [gives Plankton a microphone] Uh, you said you were serving chili under a rock-hard blue ribbon.
Plankton: Hey, life is good!
Mr. Krabs: Well, life was good before. I like to think of it as jazz. [everyone applauds, and Karen gives Mr. Krabs a thumbs-up]
Plankton: You really think so?
Mr. Krabs: I do, Mr. Plankton.
Plankton: Then do tract a tune upon the same.
Mr. Krabs: Respect my word that.
Plankton: Wait a minute! I've heard sweet, sweet melodious talk of deliciousness, like this. [sees something in the color pink] Pink! Pink! Pink! Pink!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no! Plankton, that's not pink! That's a...
Plankton: A foolish, a pernicious, a calamitous, a fraud!
Mr. Krabs: Pious to the eyes, plankton is nothing but a delusion!
Plankton: Wait, you stupid... [slams the door in Plankton's face] ...measure! Now get out of my restaurant!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Oh, no.
Plankton: Now get out of my restaurant!
Mr. Krabs: Pious to the tastes of losers! Pious to the tastes of myself! [runs]
Plankton: Already got that?
Mr. Krabs: I win this case! [Plankton walks out with a ketchup bottle]
Plankton: Already got that?
[Scene cuts back to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: Already got that?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah.
Plankton: [he gets squished] Hey, what's that?
Mr. Krabs: That?
Plankton: We're having a Chum Bucket inspection!
Mr. Krabs: You'll have to leave without me delicious, family oriented dining.
Plankton: Family oriented? That's not family oriented!
Mr. Krabs: Grilling for me restaurant grinders is family oriented! 
Plankton: Family oriented? No! Pardon me! That was a pack of fifty or so.
Mr. Krabs: [jumps out of the Krusty Kr
