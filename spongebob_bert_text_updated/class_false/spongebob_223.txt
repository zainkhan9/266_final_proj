[The camera zooms in on Squidward's house. Squidward, who is now laying down, slides over to the easel.]
Squidward: Well, that's more like it. I was–[opens the door to see SpongeBob] able.
SpongeBob: That's great! I'm SpongeBob SquarePants, citizen cop! [laughs] I can't believe it. But I have to go to work at the Krusty Krab before I do my gig. [pushes his hat away]
Squidward: Oh. [gets pulled into the kitchen where he nervously answers the door] Can I help you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes.
Squidward: Is it time already?
SpongeBob: Sure.
Squidward: Excuse me, good night.
SpongeBob: [hops on his chair and goes back to the kitchen] Ah, would you like some of my smoothie along with your fine wine?
Squidward: I always hate going to work.
SpongeBob: I know! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Make it work.
Squidward: I don't understand. Why haven't any of them [climbs down the wall] sprung their trap?
SpongeBob: Well, they seem to have sprung theirs.
Squidward: Uhh, I don't think that's the problem.
SpongeBob: Why, Squidward?
Squidward: [opens the cabinet door] I never noticed that when I first entered the kitchen.
SpongeBob: That's great, Squidward! Well, let's see. Hmm, I could hop on that little old thing and ride its trampoline–[SpongeBob starts pedaling]–like it's Monkey King form!
Squidward: I think not.
SpongeBob: But what about, uh, the monkey things? I mean, you sure have monkeys over there. What are you doing with those monkeys?
Squidward: Oh, oh, I, I just got off of my Wheel of Fortune and I'm also a monkey! [walks away. Cut to later] Well, monkey goodness, that was a good one. Oh, what could be worse than monkey?
SpongeBob: Oh, nothing. Hey, Squidward, have you ever seen monkeys before? [shows a stack of bank notes with the words, "Here I come… [in a monkey voice] with a jaw and a million parts"?]
Squidward: Please don't put me in a cage!
SpongeBob: Oh, what can be said? I've gone on hundreds of bikers and am number one.
Squidward: There's no time for now, SpongeBob. Stop right now. [drives out. SpongeBob comes out of the Krusty Krab with one of his mouth welded on] I want what's left of me.
SpongeBob: No, no, wait.
Squidward: Stop. [Squidward stops his driving and his urchins attack him]
SpongeBob: Ahh. who am I to deserve such a great deal?
Squidward: Why, you're just such a gentleman. My life is no road, you know. I like road, road, road, road.
SpongeBob: Hey.
Squidward: No, I don't.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Road is the best thing that ever happened. [laughs]
Squidward: What's that?
SpongeBob: [laughs] SpongeBob SquarePants. I just got off of my job at the Krusty Krab. [laughs]
Squidward: Ah. [bubble transition to a worker cleaning a boat as he drives by a statue of SpongeBob] Ah. Huh?
Worker: Is SpongeBob so much better?
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, I mean, uh, not really.
Worker: Then you're a Krusty Krab. [SpongeBob drives away]
SpongeBob: But I'm soooyoung. If I were old Tim, I'd be driving here right now. [goes inside and puts sock on head and drives as he goes. Then comes back and his speedometer falls off]
Squidward: He's almost driving.
SpongeBob: Ahh, at this rate, we'll never see this fine point.
Squidward: I'm almost begging you, officer. Keep up this good! I'm doing it!
SpongeBob: But I'm still a baby.
Mr. Krabs: Eh? Fey? [walks away]
Squidward: I can't believe such a great man
