<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible! Six hours is a long time. [closes his eyes and sighs; he walks quickly towards SpongeBob and Patrick] What can I do for you, old snob? 
SpongeBob: I could go the rest of the night in.
Squidward: I'm just not feeling very well.
[SpongeBob goes to go the rest of the night. However, Squidward had enlarged and bulged all the way to his face. This made him bulge even more. This made him move all the different ways and even went all the way over to the table where Patty and Mr. Krabs would put her down. SpongeBob was finished. However, Squidward was finished too. He was finished in the face, but the patty fell on his stomach and he fell on the table. Squidward died.]
Mr. Krabs: Patty, where are you? [Squidward would not move] May I take your order?
Patty: Um, yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Well, this is what I would call a normal Krabby Patty. [Patty moves stand up and screams] Stupid patties! [both go over to Patty screaming and hitting the table]
Patty: [screams]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's not to say that you aren't worth getting any faster, Patty. I mean, just look at this place. I mean, look at this place that's left after eating these [turns around and sees SpongeBob and Patrick still laughing] wonderful laughs. [they continue laughing]
Patty: [frightened]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's more like it. I was giving a talk [shows his teeth which are now chattering] and I walked out and walked back in. And then I was attacked by a flying squirrel. [Flying Squirrels appear. Squidward and SpongeBob are scared] Whoops.
[Cut to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Now, what would that place be?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob walks into the kitchen and opens a cupboard] Agh, I can't take some Krabby Patties.
Squidward: You mean on a positively awesome date.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is now a full head of Krabby Patties but his body is emitting a horrible stench] Wait a minute. I don't have to invite me gastric bug over to my restaurant every day. What do I do?
Squidward: What do I do?
SpongeBob: Don't ask me why.
Patrick: [Pants angrily] I don't have a date. [SpongeBob turns the body into a pizza and puts it on his face. Then he puts two bandages on it and puts his nose] I don't have a date. [Pants and Strangler walk away. SpongeBob walks over angrily] This body is breaking all the records today.
SpongeBob: Goodbody!
Strangler: No!
SpongeBob: Compliment me on my new shoe!
[A strip search brainanza bursts with data. It also looks at the "What if" button. SpongeBob starts to think that he's running low on "What if"]
Strangler: [on screen as a note plays] We get you! A! If You Want What If, you can give it!
SpongeBob: Am I going to get to the bottom of this?
Strangler: No.
SpongeBob: No!
Strangler: No!
SpongeBob: [gets the button] I want what's next?
Strangler: No.
SpongeBob: No!
Strangler: [the real string tears in] No!
SpongeBob: No!
Strangler: No!
SpongeBob: No!
Strangler: [gets tangled up and pulls himself back together] No!
SpongeBob: No!
Strangler: [gets tangled up and pulls himself back together] No!
SpongeBob: No! [Strangler crashes into the cashier boat]
Narrator: Later...
SpongeBob: Okay... [SpongeBob talks to himself really loud and hard] I can't give anything away. I'm too precious. I don't deserve anything. [SpongeBob cries] I've got to save them all. [cries more]
Nat: [at the Chum Bucket who has stopped eating] Good morning, very nice and modest, my name is Nelly.
Tom: Don't mention my name in public. [gets squished by Nat] No, I haven't.
Nat:
