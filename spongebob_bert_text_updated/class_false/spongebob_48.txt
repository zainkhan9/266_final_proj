SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, I don't want to disappoint you, but I don't want to disappoint you on more than one count. So tell me, do you like me?
Squidward: Well, how many times do I have to tell you, good sir? Always be ready to give in to the primal urge of need. Understand? One... out of ten... [Squidward starts to bark and snarl, four times] I'm gonna be quiet for a few minutes. Just... let me do the talking. Oh, good sir, let's have some ideas.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Squidward, do ya?
Squidward: No. My idea is as good as yours. [muffled] Okay... [muffled screech] let's go! [Squidward almost mauls SpongeBob, but Squidward takes him behind the register] Take a look, Mr. Workman. [Squidward tries to get SpongeBob's attention, but SpongeBob is too busy mauling Squidward to notice]
SpongeBob: I have to go now, Mr. Workman. [tries to stop the "Help Wanted" sign from going over the fence] But the signles are hard to get to."
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: Well, I think I can find my way to the front door.
Squidward: You have to find your way first!
SpongeBob: I'm not leaving this spot to go begging! [jumps on Squidward's back. Squidward's eyes well up with tears] I'm going to find my way back. There! There's two things I need of you, Squidward. [SpongeBob and Squidward get into a fight]
SpongeBob: I bet you could use a little help here. [Takes out a toilet paper basket, puts it in front of Squidward's and Mrs. Puff's houses, and leaves. Squidward and SpongeBob are at the back door. Squidward opens the door] Good day, Squidward. I'm First Class Patrick.
Patrick: Good morning, class!
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I couldn't do it without you!
Squidward: Don't worry, I'll get in line. [He runs to the door, but SpongeBob locks the door behind him]
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Krabs, I have a better idea! What is the meaning of this thing?
Squidward: Why is it here? What is its...
Mr. Krabs: Why are you talking to me?
SpongeBob: I'm Squidward's teacher and Mrs. Puff's Mother. And we have to believe that we are friends!
Squidward: Why are you all still here?
Mrs. Puff: Why are you all still here?
SpongeBob: We have to believe that we are friends!
Squidward: Well, I better go home and get some rest.
Mrs. Puff: Why are you all still here?
Squidward: Well, you see, SpongeBob and I are... [jumps on the ground] ...going for a cocoa bath.
SpongeBob: Do you have to go, Mrs. Puff? [Mrs. Puff giggles. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff at home going through the Krusty Krab checklist]
Mrs. Puff: I'm sure it'll be a pain to return home.
SpongeBob: Oh, I know. Let me have it. [holds up a bag] Mm-hmm. [Sobbing] I know it all. I promise to be exact.
Mrs. Puff: All right. Your house is yours, sir.
SpongeBob: Darn! [sniffs the air] Uh, yeah, what is that smell?
Mrs. Puff: That's her curse.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, if I could just have a suggestion for you. If you could tell me what this stink is, what it is, and how to spot it best, what do you think it is?
Mrs. Puff: It's... [screams]
SpongeBob: [gasps in shock as he sees a green creature with a nose] Mrs. Puff? What is that?!
Mrs. Puff: I know it when I see it. [Mrs. Puff screams as she is shaking her head] The stench of a customer's greed.
