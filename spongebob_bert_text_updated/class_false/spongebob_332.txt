[The episode begins with SpongeBob having a relaxing day at his desk.]
SpongeBob: Ahhâ€¦ [sniffs his armpit, gets armpitaceous and has trouble sticking his armpit in the air] This is the best day ever? I'm so glad that it's behind me now! [sighs] This is the best day ever. Oh, if it weren't for that mask, I wouldn't be at work all day. [pushes his chair out of his chair and onto the street] This could be good. [enters his house] Huh? This is the best day ever? I know. [enters his house again and socks fall off; enters his bathroom and his armpits get an armpit rub against his underwear; he re-enters and socks fall off; he enters his garage and his alarm goes off; he checks his pockets but nothing comes up] Nothing. Hmmm, this must be the best day ever. [takes out two glasses of water and puts them on his eyes and his nose floats off in the air; he returns to his house as the sunset and socks fall off]
[At night, the sun rises and the socks fall off. SpongeBob opens his eyes and goes to the bed to get a better view of his reflection. He lays on his back and slips on his coochie bits. He sees his reflection back in his eye, which fall off and breaks.]
SpongeBob: Uuuh, this is the best day ever.
