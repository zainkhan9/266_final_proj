[Starts riding his skateboard to Old Man Jenkins' house and begins to think that he is going to have to move his clarinet to live in harmony with the other clarinet players. When he solves his problem by turning on the magic clarinet's magic music, Old Man Jenkins sees that it makes noises]
Old Man Jenkins: ♪La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la. La-la-la-la.♪
The magic clarinet melts the floor in its tracks]
SpongeBob: Oh, my goodness. I can't believe that magic clarinet could ever play such a powerful music! [After hearing the magic music, Old Man Jenkins sighs] Well, good night, Jenkins. [After hearing the magic music, Old Man Jenkins sighs again] SpongeBob, this sure is a game. [SpongeBob picks up his toy and starts to pick it up] Oh!
[Old Man Jenkins belches loudly, causing the magic clarinet to land into a vase next to the other magic clarinet players. SpongeBob opens the vase revealing that the magic music is actually coming from SpongeBob's inner shell. The shell opens revealing that the magic music is actually a robot until SpongeBob gets his turn revealing that it is actually a lima-crested version of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. SpongeBob takes the lead in revealing the magic music while the robot was revealed.]
Robot: [high pitched] ♪La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la.♪
Mermaid Man: [laughs] ♪La-la, la-la, la-la, la.♪
Barnacle Boy: [high pitched] ♪La-la, la-la, la-la, la.♪
Old Man Jenkins: Har, har, har! That was so beautiful!
[The lima-crest robot punches Mermaid Man in the face and sends him flying into a lighthouse. The lima-crest robot kicks Mermaid Man through a train track. The lima-crest robot then kicks the train car with its long legs. The train car opens and the train car drives off. All of the magic music starts playing.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, magic music! [laughs]
Old Man Jenkins: I've never been this excited about music before. I think I'm going nuts.
[Old Man Jenkins finally gets his footing and rushes outside his house to find SpongeBob there]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Mr. Jenkins! Magic is alive and well. What do you think?
Jenkins: [gets hit by Mermaid Man's clarinet] It could be really bad.
Jenkins: [gets hit by Mermaid Man's clarinet] What are you talking about?
Jenkins: [gets hit by Mermaid Man's clarinet] I heard that!
Jenkins: [gets hit by Mermaid Man's clarinet] Yeah, that's some serious horn-snapping here!
Jenkins: I don't know, it kind of creeps me out.
SpongeBob: Oh, oh!
Jenkins: I know! You feed me every nook and every dirt road!
SpongeBob: I don't know, I kind of dream onload about magic and my world-famous clarinet.
[SpongeBob and Jenkins walk away]
SpongeBob: I don't know, I don't know! I don't have anyone to talk to!
Jenkins: [groans] I'm famous!
SpongeBob: Well, okay, if that's okay, I'll talk to you.
Jenkins: [dolphin chirp] ♪You touch the sky, and it fills the sky. You touch the sky, and it fills the sky. Years ago... Johnson!♪ [takes off his cowboy hat and shows a cow] And this past week...♪
Jenkins: [shows a tank with heavy machinery] ♪Your mizzenmast, you built it! Your machine-powered chariot!♪
SpongeBob: What is that?
Jenkins: A tank! I don't know how it got here.
SpongeBob: Uh, it's not a cargo ship.
Jenkins: Aye, it is a strange world of tanks. Where tanks are so common, so powerful, and yet so far-off. [Jenkins pushes down on the box. The box bursts into flames]
Jenkins: Let's see those flames destroy this box!
SpongeBob: Sir, you destroyed my box!
Jenkins: Let's see you get out of here! [pulls a lever that turns on the condenser]
SpongeBob:
