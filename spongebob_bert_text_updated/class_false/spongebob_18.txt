[The episode begins with Patrick watching a cartoon of a jellyfish jellyfish floating around. The jellyfish appears and squirt out of the cartoons.]
SpongeBob: [screams and knocks on Patrick's bed] D-d-don't! Look! A jellyfish!
Patrick: [screams and knocks on his window] What is that?
SpongeBob: It's my favorite movie!
Patrick: Jellyfish!
[A jellyfish comes out from a jellyfish hive.]
SpongeBob: Dah-dah-don't! Look! [looks at the jellyfish and sees one flying by] That! Wuh-huh! [looks at the jellyfish and sees another one] That! Wuh-huh!
Patrick: Oh, no. That! Wuh-huh! [continues to fly] That! Wuh-huh!
SpongeBob: Dah-dah-don't! Look at that!
[Another jellyfish warps into view. The winged jellyfish start to attack while Patrick hurls and chases after them. A Komedy the red-deam rolled towards Patrick. The jellyfish roll over to form a fist and destroy Patrick's house. SpongeBob runs out of frame and comes back tied behind Patrick. He goes to try to hit SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, I'm... I'm so glad that's over.
Patrick: It's okay, SpongeBob. You were right about me back there. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick. I've learned a very important lesson. Everything I've done is a lie. I let it all down.
Patrick: Let it all down, SpongeBob! Hmmm... I lied!
[Patrick runs off and stands up. He has a tissue paper print of him on a piece of tissue paper.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is terrible!
Patrick: Yeah, it's disgusting!
SpongeBob: [looks at the piece of tissue paper on Patrick's head] Hey, look at the part. It says: "Employee, this job is non-negotiable. You agree to help me cover for my deflated pants?." Wow. Can I help you?
Patrick: Agreed. Thanks, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I got it! [jumps on Patrick's stomach]
Patrick: My pants!
SpongeBob: [jumps on Patrick's stomach again] But—but I lied!
Patrick: I lied! I lied! I lied!
SpongeBob: I got an award! [tries to open the door] But, I can't—I can't—I can't—I have my keys!
Patrick: I'm not—I'm not—
SpongeBob: Well, what do you want?
Patrick: I have a very important part to play here. [Patrick lays on his back with arms stretched out and backs up]
SpongeBob: My role is to give the cheapskate his very existence, Patrick, and to give him what he wants.
Patrick: Oh, that's very nice, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: But what about me?
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: What about—what?
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: [still confused] What about you?
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: [still confused] What about you?
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: [still confused] [Repeat after Patrick] [Repeat after Patrick] [Patrick runs a couple feet away from SpongeBob, but then he sees something behind him] SpongeBob! Patrick! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! [SpongeBob opens the door, but Patrick slams it in. They hear something pop out of the ground] SpongeBob, wait! [SpongeBob climbs up onto the rock]
Patrick: [singing to SpongeBob] Help, help, call the cops!
SpongeBob: But I was just starting to come to terms with the fact that I—[notices a shirt on a table] Oh. My. God. Shirt. is on. [Looks at Patrick's shirt] Oh. Nice khakis. What's that? It's my—[takes it off]—Nautical Name Tag. Hang on, Patrick. [SpongeBob holds up the Tag Table]
Patrick: Oh. Okay. Hey, would you mind bringing up my Tag Table?
SpongeBob: Oh, I suppose so. [walks Patrick away]
Patrick: How's it looking SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It's still early, Patrick. Nobody's shoes are out in the open.
Patrick: Oh. [walks away]
