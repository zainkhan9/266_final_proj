<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is still declining every customer's money pitch excepting the ones that were near his customers' noses.]
Mr. Krabs: No, no, no, no, no, no! Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Don't tell me anything, don't even tell me what you're tellin' to win!
Wobbles: Wow, what do you want?
Mr. Krabs: What?
Wobbles: Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, they're coming.
Wobbles: They're coming!
Mr. Krabs: What? No. No. No. No. Nonsense. You want Krabby Patties, you want money, and if there's one thing we know about the Amazin' Krabby Pattycies there, it's that it be blinders!
Wobbles: Blinders?!
Mr. Krabs: [looks at himself] Uh, I'm handsome, you're handsome, and I'm handsome! So if you want to win, you've got to get away from me, okay? [gets flopped on by the dollar]
[Wobbles starts crying. Mr. Krabs is laughing and they're taking the money]
Mr. Krabs: I'll take that!
[Wobbles gets flopped on to a chair and they both sit on the floor. The chair is overturned and overturned again. Another dollar bill is thrown at the same dollar bill and it lands on the other side of the room. A clock faces up, same as before]
Mr. Krabs: [yells] Ow! Don't tell me you're tired of me watching you! I've got an important customer tonight.
[They both dangle onto the window by their sides]
Mr. Krabs: Don't blow your nose in. We're having a good night's sleep.
SpongeBob: [whimpers] Wow, [shrugs] has him seen? He's handsome.
Mr. Krabs: Is he handsome?
SpongeBob: No.
[They both wink at each other, leaving the dollar bill on the window. Mr. Krabs sighs and walks home]
Mr. Krabs: [begins walking home and stopping at the Pineapple where he sees the dollar sign] Gummy,o goodness doy.
[He turns around, dashing home. A dollar bill lands on his eye as he sees it. He looks in the dollar sign again. He makes his way over to the front of the restaurant, stops at the Krabby Patties and puts his hand on his heart]
Mr. Krabs: Gee, it really is handsome.
[The dollar bill falls off the window]
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs, it's the handsome bill that I owe you.
Mr. Krabs: The handsome bill? I can't afford a single dollar.
SpongeBob: So, you don't?
Mr. Krabs: It's not a [stretches out a greedy smile] ♪I can't afford a nickel!♪
[Then some seconds later, the same dollar bill falls off the window and Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are completely shocked.]
Mr. Krabs: You're kidding? That's the kind of shamelessness I would pay two crusty old white guys a fee for!
[He runs out of his office]
SpongeBob: This is serious, Mr. Krabs. We're being paid to ruin. We can't have cheap, accidental fun!
Mr. Krabs: No, really, please pay attention.
[SpongeBob begins to lose his sanity]
Mr. Krabs: Not that. Not that. PAYBACK. [picks up his alarm clock] Okay, you want to take a little time off now?.. Okay. [shuts it] I'm taking the leave of me old man.
[Later]
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs, have a nice day. [notices his fortune] Ooh, my fortune.
Mr. Krabs: Great. So, how's going to be?
SpongeBob: Morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: At least it's not like my past jokes brigade. [scene cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen putting the fortune cookies on a plate] Good morning, fortune.
SpongeBob: Morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not taking the leave of my fortune anymore. It's time to take a little vacation.
SpongeBob: What's vacation, you ask?
Mr. Krabs: Well, today is the 50th anniversary
