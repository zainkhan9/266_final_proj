SpongeBob: [whispering] Hey, Patrick. I have to keep me eyes clean every so often to keep from falling asleep on this nice. [tries to open his door, which is a picture of a door on a wall] The Krusty Krab, home.
Patrick: [opens door again] Sorry, SpongeBob, but I'm going to have to... close... [tries to pull open the door, but couldn't because of his medallion] The Krusty Krab, home.
SpongeBob: [opens door again] Sorry, Patrick. I'm going to have to... [pull it back, but wasn't able to get it] The Krusty Krab, home.
Patrick: [opens door again] Sorry, SpongeBob, I'm going to have to... [OPTIONS GRAB] The Krusty Krab, home.
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Krusty Krab, home?! [continues to push everyone's buttons, but gets blown away appear of his nose] The Krusty Krab, oh, the Krusty Krab, the Krusty Krab! [grunts as he pulls the button on the door, but it collapses and rolls away]
Squidward: Nice try, SpongeBob, but I'm going to have to find a new place for me. [SpongeBob claps his hands in the air and tries to get out of The Krusty Krab, but gets dragged down by all the customers and customers go berserk, and breaks into pieces]
Frank: You ruined my last order!
Squidward: Oh, no, I ruined your. [SpongeBob comes in with another order] I ruined your.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Replacement Krabs, eh? What do you think about this job?
Squidward: Replacement Krabs, oh, this is a great order!
SpongeBob: Well, I'll have to take over the Krusty Krab, but that's where the Krusty Krab comes through. Now, you can join me there.
Squidward: That's exactly what I said--replacement.
SpongeBob: Hey, wait a minute, Squidward! You can join my new organization, Uh, we'll become the Krusty Krab!
Squidward: The organization will become extinct if we don't get a name for it.
SpongeBob: Hey, you forgot the replacement Krabs!
Squidward: The Krusty Krab will be the biggest, meanest, meanest place to have a baby ever! You'll be the face of Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Hey, uh, we're the No SpongeBob’s Club!
Squidward: And you'll run the place like a hog! [Club members run the place like a hog.]
SpongeBob: Well, we’ll never forget you, Squidward. But what will happen next?
[cut to SpongeBob and Squidward outside]
SpongeBob: I'll say. Most of you are joining me new club, Mr. Wormsley.
Squidward: We're joining a mad club!
SpongeBob: We think that we know the man.
Squidward: Well, I don't know what you're talking about. [cut to later] Oh, wait. I'm joining you. Join me, as we change lives.
SpongeBob: Lives.
Squidward: And save my club, for I give you...
SpongeBob&#160;: You to my club? Where are we going?
Squidward&#160;: And what are we doing now?
SpongeBob: We're going to save the Krusty Krab!
Squidward: That wonderful place. It seems the only place that has DNA that goes like Squidward.
SpongeBob: That's because we're both members of the very club that you're talking about.
Squidward: Uh, yes, that is.
SpongeBob: But then I quit.
Squidward: Oh, good grief. That gives me an idea. [Squidward runs off]
SpongeBob: We're going to save the Krusty Krab.
Squidward: [yawns] That gives me an idea.
SpongeBob: Squidward, you're right. The Krusty Krab needs a name.
Squidward: [nervously] What?!
SpongeBob: We're going to save the Krusty Krab.
Squidward: Oh, I'm not wrong to be afraid. Saving the Krusty Krab is the most beautiful thing in
