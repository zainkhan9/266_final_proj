[Episode starts with Gary watching TV]
Monica: Help! Help!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey, Gare-bear. Now that SpongeBob is gone, there is no reason to worry about his welfare. [SpongeBob is playing on the clarinet badly] When he comes back, there will be no need for assistance.
Clarke: You mean help?
Mr. Krabs: We're just offering to help you.
Clarke: Well, what are you playing on the kitchen table?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, one of which I'll play! [cries] But it's not for everyone.
Clarke: Oh, I don't either. Please, if I can play on the clarinet.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't, you're playing on the kitchen table. [dials up on the table] Please,... make changes? [changes his playing to make a new tune] Come on, let' get one! I can't give up, Gare-Bear. [changes his tune to really get an idea. Mr. Krabs screams and runs out of the room]
SpongeBob: What's going on, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I... uh... I'm sorry, boy, you're still alive.
SpongeBob: But... but why?
Mr. Krabs: I can't give up, boy. I've got another plan. [He comes back into the room] Uh, what? No, I'm not leaving.
SpongeBob: [angrily] All out, Mr. Krabs. All out in all theates! [sobs] I can't believe it's working!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, all you do with me, are you going to tell it like it is?
SpongeBob: Umm, no, I don't want to know.
Mr. Krabs: Come here. [Mr. Krabs starts to blow him a kisser]
SpongeBob: Are you sure, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, the answers always depend on what you think the answer is.
SpongeBob: Gosh, you's right, too bad. I'm not sure what the president is saying.
Mr. Krabs: I think he's saying that he's gonna give us a surprise, so we need to hurry or we'll... uh... uh... [cries a confused SpongeBob bursts through the wall]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't think so.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you don't have to be panicking. It's just a game. And if you think I'm panicking, just ask me.
SpongeBob: Um, Mr. Krabs. I changed the play area from one green to the yellow. And did you know it's built around your magnificent head, that you now have two noses?
Mr. Krabs: That's right. The one's in the kitchen, and the other one's in the bathroom.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, it's obvious. What is the meaning of this one?
Mr. Krabs: It's a play-date. [He takes two noses] And don't come back until you've got another one.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] No, don't come up. I don't need any help. I just need two. [smiles. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs working together.] We trust nothing in my wild, the deep sea.
Fish #1: This is the life so hot, it's unbearable! [the anchor drops on the island Fish #1 and it falls on top of SpongeBob and Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: It landed just outside of here.
Squidward: Here, Mr. Krabs. It's not coming back.
Mr. Krabs: [angry face] All right, all right. [he points at SpongeBob] You're just under one quarter of the way there. [he starts to laugh nervously. The scene changes to Squidward on a bench listening to music on a Krusty Krab radio. SpongeBob walks up to him.]
SpongeBob: All right, boys. One quarter for lemonade, please.
Squidward: [offscreen, narrating] Somehow, I ended up giving up the lemonade. [he turns to a TV] What happened to you, boys?
SpongeBob: Yeah, everything was fine then. In fact, I was thinking about giving up my job as janitor.
Squidward: [reading screen] Why are you all still here?
SpongeBob: Yeah, because I like
