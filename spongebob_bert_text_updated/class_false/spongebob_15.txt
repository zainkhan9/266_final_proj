[Mr. Krabs starts to feel guilty.]
SpongeBob: But I didn't even steal Sandy's formula!
Mr. Krabs: Good point. Don't worry about stealing, SpongeBob. I'll fix you. [leaves]
[Meanwhile, Squidward is sleeping on the job. The foghorn alarm clock goes off.]
Squidward: Ow. [is now at the clock with his and Sandy's bodies under him] 20,000...?! [screams]
[The alarm clock rings. Everyone on the premises is now in shock.]
Sandy: [gasps] The world's fifth largest soap-seller! [cries violently] And her last enemy! [runs up to the time keeper] Aww, that's the evil time keeper. [she puts the time keeper in the time keeper drawer] Now, who's getting the last laugh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [pops out of the time keeper] Hello, Lochie?
[Lochie sniffs the soap.]
Sandy: Oh, disgusting. How did you get here?
SpongeBob: It all started back in time[.] [offscreen] three billion light years from here. It's the only place we're still now. [points to the starry night] We're millions from now on, and nothing will stop us past that! [laughs] No, no, no, no, no, no, [Loss of control of the starry night and starry morning suddenly grows extreme] Gosh, this seems kind of cold. [takes off his winter coat] Why, hello again, Sandy? It's all right here, in your [closes the starry window] human body!
Sandy: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[Suddenly, the sun comes up with a strong signal that seems to be coming from the telescope.]
Sunspot: [shocked] No! No! No!
Sandy: I'm coming, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I've got an emergency!
[The telescope spot's with an extremely hot and steamy spring in it.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what's that? Oh, really? Oh, well, let's go on, Sandy. I think I know what to do.
Sandy: Let's go on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No problem, Sandy. I got it already. [But SpongeBob stops with the springs] What's the emergency, SpongeBob?
Sandy: I'm gonna grab some hot dogs, please.
SpongeBob: [Jumps on the springs] I want hotdogs.
Sandy: Hot dogs?
SpongeBob: [stops] Wait, Sandy, don't throw them.
Sandy: Oh, just leave me alone. You're not getting it.
SpongeBob: Oh, I know just what to do.
Sandy: Sandy, wait! [floats over to the picnic table, stepping on a piece of coral. She turns to a warm glow around her, which she sees. SpongeBob jumps in the air] SpongeBob? [grabs a rock]
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy.
Sandy: I need some help! [rock slams on the table again, and again SpongeBob falls on the survivors. They scream and run away as the heat builds. Some of the cave's inhabitants join in the crying and jump into the fire to help Sandy. SpongeBob floats over to Sandy and shoves her in her blankets] Sandy! Help! [sobs]
SpongeBob: Sandy! Sandy! [the cave's inhabitants jump in with sticks]
Sandy: There's the Spongy Spongy, the Sneaky Spongy, the Normal Spongy, and the Evil Spongy. All of them, they're ghoooost's for me.
SpongeBob: How are you all doing?
Sandy: I'm so sorry for wasting so much time here.
SpongeBob: I'm so sorry for what?
Sandy: What did you do to Sandy?
SpongeBob: Why?
Sandy: Well, I wanted you to have a whale.
SpongeBob: A whale?
Sandy: Oh, no.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's like one of those good times.
Sandy: Good times?
SpongeBob: Good times.
Sandy: Good times.
SpongeBob: Oh, okay.
Sandy: Good times. [she and SpongeBob start sobbing]
