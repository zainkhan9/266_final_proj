[In the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is once again busy at his office, looking at the magazine in the hand. He is wearing a business suit and tie, holding a newspaper, and holding a pencil. Above him is a small, round TV that has just appeared.]
Mr. Krabs: It's time I remembered to count it. [The newspaper falls on top of him; it starts to carry the time card] Only twenty-four hours. [Mr. Krabs narrows his eyes] Twenty-four hours? [Mr. Krabs' eyelids start to protrude. His face slowly distorts, and his right eyelid then becomes transparent and indistinct. His right arm then becomes a hoop and his back becomes a hoop. His legs walk away, and a rainbow comes out of his pants. The rainbow then turns into a fish and presents it behind Squidward. Squidward looks at it. He then starts laughing. The next scene is shown, where it is revealed that what appears to be part of the experiment was actually a purple balloon.]
Squidward: But I didn't want to balloonize. I wanted to see how you liked it. [The purple balloon floats away. The scene shows him playing his clarinet. He floats again.] I want a better shot of this president from Texas. Maybe one with pride. [Thunder crashes down. Squidward pops his head in the air. The scene returns to Squidward.] Uhh, Squidward, I know we wanted to do a better than Great Revenant, but, well, we just inwaiting, Great Revenant!
Mr. Krabs: Great Revenant?
Squidward: You mean to tell us to go fight that?
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute, Squidward, we're having a... [scene cuts to a TV being held up for people to see]
Great Revenant: I just served a short formal training camp here, and I think I can handle.
Nat: I can handle?
Great Revenant: You mean you've got training under way.
Nat: I can handleâ€” [pushes the button and the TV starts rolling out the images. He goes back to the TV] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-oh-oh! [great reed flaps his head]
Mr. Krabs: [Now Mr. Krabs is lying face-down on the ground, with his arms crossed] Wait, don't tell me. I can't handle this. [As he is saying this, the TV starts to roll to a live-action shot of SpongeBob holding a tank.] I can't even hold my breath. This must be extreme.
SpongeBob: [holding a tank top] Just put it down! [As he is saying this, the camera zooms in on a painting. It is the sign that reads, "House of Triumph".] One side only, Krabby Patty coochie.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? I can hardly take my eyes off this.
SpongeBob: [While the other two are lying on the ground, screaming] They're making me scream.
Mr. Krabs: They're making me scream.
SpongeBob: [While screaming] Well, you better calm down, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Screaming is what ya got, boy. [SpongeBob shrugs. SpongeBob runs away]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward, I'll get this infernal tank top hat by using my extreme body control. [Squidward stomps away]
Squidward: What's that, gross?
Patrick: Looks like some sort of mid-air jerk move.
SpongeBob: Good question, Squidward. What do you think?
Squidward: I don't know. I guess... [Runs over to the TV. Opens up the TV and points it at Patrick]
Patrick: Patrick, you're supposed to be mowing the lawn.
Squidward: Mowing the lawn? What does that mean?
Patrick: It's our yard.
SpongeBob: So, you don't sow your own lawn or make yourselves a garden?
Patrick: We don't have any lawns.
SpongeBob: Well, we...
Patrick: We just don't have a garden. [cuts to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are painting their lawn]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick. You look so tiny.
Patrick: You look great.
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, this is what I am... [Patrick gets up] looking good!
Patrick: How do we get over there?
SpongeBob: Pat, don't you understand-- [cuts to Patrick's home where he is riding a
