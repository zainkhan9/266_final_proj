[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs has just finished telling his customers what it is when a spatula shines from a hidden pole.]
Mr. Krabs: And it's not just me, either! [shows a wide shot of the restaurant] it's Mr. Krabs brand! [attempts to use the spatula, but it falls out] Ow!
[A customer throws a spatula at the Chum Bucket. The customer throws another at SpongeBob. SpongeBob uses his spatula to stop the Chum Bucket's moving and to get SpongeBob to stop throwing the spatula.]
Mr. Krabs: Just stop... [chases his spatula and uses it to get SpongeBob to stop throwing the spatula. He then uses it to subdue the Boogey Man.]
Boogey Man: [his head has rats on it] You stink, Krabs! [the customers start to bark and do something]
Mr. Krabs: [growls and looks at his watch] Oh, gotta go, eh steamy?
[Suddenly, the doorbell rings. Mr. Krabs goes up into the door, opens it, and there's a big police officer standing there. He walks over and whispers to the cop]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the police here. Uh, can I help you?
Mr. Krabs: Why can't I help you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It's the old police snitch, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, there you go. [shows a bunch of police officers surrounding him]
SpongeBob: Where are you officers?
[A police helicopter pops up. The customers run out and scream as the police officers show up. Mr. Krabs runs into the kitchen. SpongeBob comes out of the freezer, with gloves on]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, me boy. Let's go get some chum.
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs. I need some help. [Mr. Krabs moves a can of soup into the can and closes the doorknob] No, no, please. [notices the officer with the ski mask on] Uh, she's blocking our way. Uh, I'll use her. [goes down, but the officer starts to cough heavily. He backs up and falls to the floor] Don't do it, SpongeBob! Don't use her! Don't use her! [the officer starts choking heavily] Stop choking!
[SpongeBob breathes in and out of her.]
SpongeBob: [tries to deliver the chum, but she pulls him back] Oh, I'm not coming! [sobs and tries to hold onto the chum, but she pulls it back.] No, no, no! Don't let go! Negatory, kind, loving cherub. [SpongeBob holds onto the chum, but is soon forgotten.] Uh, whoa! [SpongeBob resumes choking.] I can't do this! I can't do this! I'm not good enough! [SpongeBob starts choking as he tries to pick up a flower pot. The copier lands on the trash robot and gets pushed into a trash can. He tries again, but gets picked up and thrown into one of the trash cans. He then gets smashed by a copier and thrown into a flower pot.] I'm so hungry! I don't have enough chum! I must get chum with pleasure! [He starts eating the chum, which makes him feel pain in his stomachs. He then eats some more chum and his stomach growls at him] I can't get some chum with pleasure this taste! I must get some chalice with pleasure!
[SpongeBob eats some of the chum and enjoys it. A fish is shown sitting at a table watching a movie. He is licking some things on the side of the screen.]
Anchor Fish: [on the screen] When is the last time you took a sip of our rare and under-appreciated art?
