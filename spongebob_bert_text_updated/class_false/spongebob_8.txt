<Start Ep> 
[Episode starts when SpongeBob and Patrick walk into the Krusty Krab. Inside, SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting on the floor, looking at a menu.]
 SpongeBob: Hmm... I think I can't find the spatula. Hmm... I think I got yelps today. [laughs] Hmm... I think my spatula looks pretty blotty [Laughs].
 Patrick: You don't need this, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob wipes his mouth with the spatula]
 SpongeBob: [Laughs] I need a break. [Walks off] Ahah, ah! Hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina! [Waves his hands in a mutteringam] Wha... [Throws spatula] Oh, ratfish! [Running to a cave] I've got to find him! [Puts all the items under a nearby rock and drop the rock on SpongeBob]
Squidward: It's the most annoying job in the world.
SpongeBob: It is? [SpongeBob forms into a jellyfish and tries to blow stuff up with his hands] No, that's not a typo. [Stops and Rolls the Spatula] Yes, now you'm a annoying job. [Screams and trips over his head the whole way] Ow! I mean, what's so annoying about it?
 Squidward: Why is he the same way?
 SpongeBob: [Slides on Squid's face and laughs] Oh, he's just as much of a weirdo as he sounds. [Jellyfish floats over SpongeBob the other way, becoming startled and sending splinters everywhere. Squidward's head flies off the splinter and points towards the Krusty Krab]
 Squidward: [Washes SpongeBob and eats the Flying Dutchman's Krabby Patty] Got it. [Walks to the door and attempts to open it but gets stepped on by SpongeBob]
 Flying Dutchman: [Gets up and regains consciousness] Oh, hey! You didn't push me.
 SpongeBob: [Looks in the mirror and laughs] Now I get it. You don't get it, do you? You don't get on my good side? [Laughs angrily] You'll do anyteenin' with that rusty old spoon!
 Flying Dutchman: But, of course, neither do I!
 SpongeBob: [Gets off-screen] See?
 Flying Dutchman: [Swallows a sigh of relief and re-enters the Krusty Krab] I meant up here! [He places an "AW" on the top of the diving board] I mean, up here! [He pulls out a screwdriver and used the rest of the tools he had at his back to make a Krabby Patty]
 Mr. Krabs: [Prepares to punch in the blueprints of the Krabby Patty] Well, you're quite the planner, SpongeBob, but just remember one quick note.
 SpongeBob: [Walks Mr. Krabs into the Krusty Krab] Two ready, two burned. [He pushes the button which activates the fire hydrant on] Uhh, Krabby, uhh, what're you all doing here?
 Mr. Krabs: What's going on out here?
 SpongeBob: I said what do we do?
 Mr. Krabs: We're still here. Well, what do you want toenail?
 SpongeBob: [Scared] Krabby Patty?! [Throws the Patty under the grill and throws a cherry on top. He throws the cherry on top and throws the handle a bit of time to catch the phone] Hello? number? Yes, one of SpongeBob's pockets? Thanks. [He takes the phone and calls] Hello, I want toenail. That goes here. Hello, I want this toenail tottenail tottenail tottenail tottenail tottenail tottenail tottenail.
 Mr. Krabs: Well, that rang [Squidward knocks on the door] and I turned around [Inside is a circular room with a TV and a music player. Mr. Krabs is dressed as Santa from "The Flying Dutchman", from "The Case of the Case of the Fish"] and he was talking about the weekend.
 Squidward: So, you didn't want to be late this time?
 SpongeBob: I guess so.
 Squidward: Well, you didn't have to be late, because on Sunday, the Flying Dutchman will be performing his music for you. [The Flying Dutchman's voice is echoing] Well, ol' Bikini Bottom, I'm gonna go get the dregs some more. [He takes off his raincoat to reveal a Santa hat]
 SpongeBob: Arrgh, Squidward
