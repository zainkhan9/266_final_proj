[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office counting money.]
Mr. Krabs: One thousand ninety-three, one thousand ninety-three, one thousand ninety-three hundred four, one thousand ninety-three hundred five, one thousand ninety-two hundred six, one thousand eight hundred seven, one thousand ninety-two hundred and throw away the magic number.
[The money falls on Mr. Krabs' head.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's gone. [shows the money] It's gone. Gone. Gone. [shows the Krusty Krab] Gone. Gone. Gone. [shows the magic number] It's gone. [shows the Krusty Krab lights] [yelling] It's gone. [the magic number slowly falls off his hand] Ooh, magic number! Go, go, go, go! [the magic number slowly falls off his hand] Go, go, go, go!
[The magic number continuously falls. Bubbles form above Mr. Krabs' face, as SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs continue to shout and kick and stomp and bounce and eat and eat and eat and eat.]
SpongeBob: [groaning] Oh, Mr. Krabs, [the four are on the ceiling below the magic number] we're all lost and we're gonna find them tomorrow.
[SpongeBob grabs a bag andgums up the magic number. Then he walks towards the four.]
SpongeBob: [closes his bag] Mr. Krabs, [he opens his bag.] we're all lost! And none of us are ever gonna find them. [the four close their bag] Unless... porpoise!
[SpongeBob jumps for Mr. Krabs, but the bag is empty.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Where is he? [screams]
[The magic number flies onto SpongeBob's nose. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs run and leap excitedly. They jump the final 100 yards to get back to the Krusty Krab. They stop. Then, they enter the Chum Bucket and it spins around in circles. It jumps again and the Chum Bucket it left earlier returned to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs. It continues to dance and it keeps doing this process. It finally stops in the middle and it stops.]
Mr. Krabs: That's it! We found him! We're not going to get lost again!
SpongeBob: But we always find ourselves in a yarn of...
Mr. Krabs: C'mon, SpongeBob, let me give you a hand.
SpongeBob: Aww, [jumps off-screen and hits his arm]hey, this is kind of nice.
Mr. Krabs: Well, thank you for waiting all this for me. But you better not be late tomorrow. [chuckles] You better be late today. [walks to his office and shuts the door]
SpongeBob: [while Mr. Krabs is talking] You got it, Mr. Krabs.
[Suddenly, the doorbell rings. It's Mr. Krabs, smiling. He turns the key and the door falls apart, revealing Pearl. He then turns around, smiles, and gasps.]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl!
Pearl: [shakes her head, not noticing his stupid face] Uh, I didn't know ya'd talk to me.
Mr. Krabs: Uh...yeah, I was just gonna hang with you. just hang with whoever you want to hang with. alright...guess who?
Pearl: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: You're up for nothing, I can tell you â€” I mean, what does he know?

Mr. Krabs: Well, um...I was just telling this guy who I was dating how I got back from the beach, and he said...
Pearl: Get me out of here, you prissy!
Mr. Krabs: Argh! [grunts]

Pearl: [gasps]No, Dad. This is serious!
Mr. Krabs: I can't hang out with that girl. She's gone mad with jealousy. I have to do something.
