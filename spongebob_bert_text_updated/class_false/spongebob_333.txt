[SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting at the counter, eating. They are both laughing and are groaning. SpongeBob starts laughing then Patrick starts laughing]
SpongeBob: [starting to faint] Patrick, stop laughing. You've ruined another day. [SpongeBob stops laughing then Patrick stops laughing]
Patrick: [screams] SpongeBob, you're bleeding out! Oh, my leg.
SpongeBob: My leg! Oh, come on, Patrick. This whole "living in the moment" thingus is soosterware, you can't even look dead!... And your friend Young Doctor Strange seems to think you're still growing.
Patrick: Could you get me a couple of tissues?
[cut to SpongeBob's bed where SpongeBob has grown tired]
SpongeBob: [deadpan] All right, Patrick, you're just in time. [bends to Squidward] You're still vital. What can we do?
Patrick: Don't hurt me, SpongeBob. I'm a doctor...today's the doctor, you know.
SpongeBob: You're not, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, I'll tell you what I will. [shoves SpongeBob's face into his window] Look, SpongeBob, I'm not dying! This is not a life you're living!
SpongeBob: But, think, Pat! How would you like to live a less miserable life, if you could walk and talk like a normal person?
Pat: I'd like to live like a normal person, too, SpongeBob
Nat: [walks by with a hat in his hand] Beautiful.
SpongeBob: [laughs] I can't live like a normal person...
Nat: Would you like to know how?!
SpongeBob: [pretends to be an announcer] By walking like a normal person.
Nat: [walks by with a TV in his hand] Sounds easy. [walks off as the announcer says the following things, in a muffled voice] But if you associate walking with walking unclogging pores, you'll make your skin crawl and die. And if you think that's funny, don't just be a man! [hears some weird noises] That's walkie-talkies. What's all the ruckus?!
Announcer: Something wrong?
Nat: That's a walkie-talkie.
Announcer: Don't you mean those squeaky shells clogging up your pores?
Nat: That's a woman squeaky shell clogging up her pores!
Announcer: Well, don't you know what that means?
Nat: It means that, SpongeBob, your pores are blowing all over SpongeBob! [pepper flakes fly off his mouth]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Nat: The coughing is coming from the tears of SpongeBob.
Announcer: Something wrong with your talk?
Nat: I don't know what that means.
Announcer: Don't you know what it means?
Nat: It means that, SpongeBob, your pores are coughing up all the water for SpongeBob!
Announcer: That's not what it means, Nat.
Nat: They're saying.
Announcer: Well, it means that, SpongeBob, your tears of joy are bringing tears for Mr. SpongeBob.
Nat: Oh.
SpongeBob: [growls] Don't worry, Mr. Hall-Boy. I'm coming to get you! [hangs up the phone]
[Cut to Mr. Krabs's office]
Mr. Krabs: What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: Oh, I just got here.
Mr. Krabs: If you think you're gonna get this job, you've come to wrong. [stops; then he looks around] Oh! Well, I've learned that nothing's wrong with me mind when I'm working.
SpongeBob: You want this job, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Well, here's a job for every man, woman, child. [Everyone walks in] What can I do for you, boy?
SpongeBob: I could go the rest of the day without saying a word.
Mr. Krabs: Boy, you don't have to do that.
SpongeBob: Sure. Who do I have to talk to?
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, that's a good idea. Uh, SpongeBob, uh, you seem to be feeling a little self-conscious.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I'm feeling all self-conscious.
Mr. Krabs: I don't know what you mean.
SpongeBob: I just meant that--"I'm not feeling self-conscious"--"she
