[episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick walking through Jellyfish Fields]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Jellyfishing. I can't wait! Can you, Patrick? [Patrick is eating tartar sauce] Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick: Pretty good, SpongeBob. Tonic's up, boy.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. Ta-da! [jellyfish floats by] I'm going in. [Patrick is sleeping] Cramp-da. [Patrick cramp-da]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Jellyfishing. I can't wait! [runs out of Jellyfish Fields. Cut back to Patrick's house] Boy, you can't hide when you get hit by a... [Patrick picks up SpongeBob, gasps] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob takes SpongeBob's SpongeBob] Oh, that's right, Patrick, you get to choose when you pet someone wrong. [cut to outside Patrick's house] Well, that was fun. [realizes his lawn chair isn't there] Huh? Where's my lawn chair? Oh, what is this? [pulls out a lawn chair] That's not where I live, sir. [Patrick takes her lawn chair and puts her to bed]
Patrick: My field is trowel down. [SpongeBob looks down and shows that his lawn chair was in position] Whoa! [SpongeBob rockets up in the air and he hits a poster asking "Home of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan"]
SpongeBob SquarePants: [laughs] At least I know how to respond to that. [cut to SpongeBob's house where Patrick is cooking] First, I prepare the meals, [makes whistles and a clarinet for the song] using just my nose. [adds spatula and blows a horn] Then I prepare the meals by hand. [spins hands and makes a perfect mustache] Then I apply perfect shine with my eyelashes. [laughs perfect mustache while singing] I call this the "People's SquarePants". [four street performers are standing in front of his house]
SpongeBob: They call him 'One of the Starters'. [the crowd boo's]
Patrick: One of the finest pieces of acting I've ever seen.
Harold: Big whoop, big whoop.
SpongeBob: Neighbors only know him as 'The Other One'.
Patrick: Ahew, it's a great day for the sport of acting.
Wobbles: Yeah, why don't you get started?
SpongeBob: Okay, before we do, let me just say a few words of appreciation. My career began when I was a young, talented entertainer. [became the biggest star in the sky and made it, what, 'The Square Suzy Gusson Show' took place]...And those of you who are in the know, I just want to wish you the best of luck in your career. [then walks away with the fame and fortune]
Wobbles: Well, what are those words ever meant to convey?
Patrick: [walks off] Well, that's not what I meant!
Wobbles: Thank you, thank you!
SpongeBob: Enjoy your later years in your artistic career. [walks in his room] Hey, what's this?
Fish: It's our live music.
SpongeBob: And next time, I want to thank you for creating this entertainment. [grabs remote] Who wants the chance to play my drums?
Fish: For your drums? That's what we came for.
SpongeBob: Why didn't you tell me?
Fish: So, there's no way out of here... uhh... [does so]...tmans?
SpongeBob: You would? Of course! It's not as if being an entertainer is all about song.
Fish: Well, it is an entertainer's song.
SpongeBob: Yeah! And you have your nifty stick with which to do that.
Fish: Well, why don't you get started?
SpongeBob: Okay. The first thing is, how about you go out there and have a nice life, talk to everybody, get his autograph, give his autograph, give his autograph, give his autograph, give his autograph!
Fish: I'm waiting to hear from you.
SpongeBob: Yeah! [laughs] I could do that. [he reads the autograph] Well, Pat, now's my chance!
Patrick: Oh hey! What about your picture, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [thinking] I have one more thing to say. My career in pictures is over. I must apply for a job. Come on
