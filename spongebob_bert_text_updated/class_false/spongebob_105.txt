[The episode begins when SpongeBob is watching his fantasy television show "Pants toaster." His fantasy TV show begins.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [screams as his fantasy television show fades to a screen all staring at a camera]
Gary: [screams] Meow.
SpongeBob: [his fantasy television show suddenly launches into the air with the astronauts on it and they scream as their underwear gets sucked and stuck in their eyes] Meow.
[The astronauts start crying while SpongeBob watches in horror. The screen shows Mr. Krabs' office, where Puffy Fluffy appears and squirts ketchup on an empty plate of soup. The scene changes to show SpongeBob's living room and reveals Larry his TV show "Running Time"]
Larry: Meow.
SpongeBob: [struggles to hold back tears] Larry? [Larry turns and see's through his side of the door that SpongeBob does not realize is his, that he is choking and that he is choking] Gah! [cries] I can't believe it. My grandpa used to walk the block! And the plaque...
Larry: Show business always starts when you have the one thing that you can't control. [Larry turns back around and a piece of debris falls off and lands on SpongeBob's eye] Ow! Oh. [SpongeBob looks through the debris on SpongeBob's eye and sees the look of anger that SpongeBob had back in high school. He turns to a brick wall and sees his Grandma's rainbow wallpaper]
Grandma's Rainbow Wall: Hey, SpongeBob, these walls just don't look right! Let me know if you need anything else! I'm Grandma's Gare.
SpongeBob: Okay. [changes wallpaper]
Grandma's Remedy: We apologize. This wallpaper is a little on the a bit. We hope you don't mind if I use it on occasion. [SpongeBob checks the cabinets to make sure it's not too bright] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. This should be easy for you. Just flip them up with my power tool!
SpongeBob: Easy... huh? Then go faster, Grandma! [runs and throws his chair out of the window. Inside, Grandma is still screaming and crying]
Grandma: I wanna see you take a better picture! [sobs]
SpongeBob: [lifts his chair up] Please don't haunt me!
Grandma: [crying] I can't take anymore! I've got to see these evil things! [cries]
SpongeBob: [crying] They're everywhere!
Larry: Look at them!
Pearl: [crying] She'll be so proud of me!
Grandma: Look at all the pink, round guys!
Mr. Krabs: Pearl! Pearl!
Pearl: Mr. Krabs! Pearl!
Grandma: I can't take it anymore! They're ruining my day!
Mr. Krabs: It's only my wig-- Pearl! [Pearl jumps and hits Pearl in the head with the wig, causing her to fall and hit Mr. Krabs again] Oof! Oof! [Grandma hits Pearl again]
Pearl: Look at all the guys!
Grandma: Ooh! Let's all take a day off! Please, Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: Aye, me boy! Okay, Grandma. Excuse me, what do you wish to talk about, Pearl?
Pearl: I just wanted to say that I'm tired of your cruel, controlling, bullying, vicious, nasty, nasty hello. I know it's hard for you to accept, but until you get rid of all this, I'm sure you'll be fine.
Mr. Krabs: But what about all this stuff Grandma? C'mon, Grandma!
Grandma: I wanna be a big daddy to you!
Mr. Krabs: No, no, Grandma. No, no, no, no. Just let me...go home. [the wind blows an ax which knocks down a pole] Ow!
Grandma: [in horror] Oh, ow.
Mr. Krabs: [the ax knocks the sand castle down] Whoa! That was a close one! Ow.
Pearl: It's okay, Grandma. Now how do you explain this: In order to give yourself peace of mind, you separate your bed and breakfast while you dig this baby out of the sand castle. [removes the bone from the bone exchange barn's ground] While you listen, I [gives yourself a barn bounce] a-bo-b-bye! It's nice to be naturalized.
Grandma: B-bye. [doesodle]
