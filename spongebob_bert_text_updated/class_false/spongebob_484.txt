[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick walking through Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob is laying down on the ground, while Patrick is on the saw, boomerang, oracleang and SpongeBob is hanging on the rope. SpongeBob is struggling to hang onto some vines, while Patrick is bouncing on a banana stick. SpongeBob manages to hang onto one of the vines, but is unsuccessful in getting the rope he was trying to hang across. SpongeBob sees this and tries to escape from downing the vine.]
SpongeBob: Huh? [the last of which makes him scream in pain] Hey! Gooby! [runs through his teeth like a dog]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, watch it come true!
SpongeBob: Come on, I've got to get in line! [tries to get in line, but he gets himself tangled in the worms' grasp] What do you say to a lie, Patrick?
Patrick: Say, "Copy me."
SpongeBob: Y-y-yes!
Patrick: Then let's go.
SpongeBob: No, no. [tries to push back the rope, but his efforts are instrumental in tip-over-the-wall-of-Squidward] Uh, doo-doo! [SpongeBob falls on top of Patrick and Patrick falls onto the ground]
SpongeBob: You fell on your head! Well, I think you should be ashamed! [drops Patrick] Patrick, you've been right all along!
Patrick: Right along! Don't you see, SpongeBob, I'm right there to see it?
SpongeBob: Yeah, right there. What, exactly?
Patrick: Oh, sorry. That's what I've been doing all day.
SpongeBob: Y-You mean to say, bully?!
Patrick: bully?! [laughs] No, I mean get off! [turns around and makes friendly waves at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, I'm afraid so. [tries to push]
Patrick: No, no, I'm not going! [tries to push again]
SpongeBob: No! [laughs] No! [laughs] No! [laughs]
Patrick: [laughs as if he were a horse]
SpongeBob: [laughs like a horse]
Patrick: [laughs like a horse]
SpongeBob: [laughs like a horse]
Patrick: [laughs like a horse]
SpongeBob: [laughs like a horse]
[Patrick's slime trail leads SpongeBob to a pile of dirt on the ground. SpongeBob digs up more dirt and puts it on his head. He then gets in a high-powered horse and rides around. But Patrick is waiting impatiently, so much that his tooth is stuck in SpongeBob's body.]
Patrick: Tooth, I want a new tooth. I think I should do this old dog. [touches the ground] What is that thing?
SpongeBob: It's my new pony. [Patrick neighs]
Patrick: Oh, hey! I want this pony! [SpongeBob runs over] I'm not mad, I just couldn't give it to you. [rubs his head and moans] Hey, I'm mad! [cries and runs into the Krusty Krab] I came here to live, Bikini Bottom, [throws spatula] I can't live without that thing! [throws hat at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick? Oh, hi, SpongeBob. I thought you were in danger!
Patrick: Oh, I'm not! [runs out laughing] That's because you're not scared of being stalked by me. Because I am!
SpongeBob: That's because you're not scared of heights! [laughs] Because you're too afraid to... [thud his horn] ...walk! [Patrick runs over] And you walk by myself? [Patrick runs over, into the kitchen. SpongeBob runs over, over to Squidward in the bathroom] Howdy, little Squidward, howdy, little SpongeBob.
Squidward: What should we do?
SpongeBob: I'd say, start feeding Gary.
Squidward: Am I in danger?
SpongeBob: In danger, of course. [laughs]
Squidward: [stops laughing] Wh-wh-why have you been feeding me stuffs? Why do you think Squidward's house is haunted?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. He's not very well, and I don't think he'll be any time soon. [continues laughing]
Squidward: I hope this doesn't mean that I can't be a part of
