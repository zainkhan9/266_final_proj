He also steals a patty. The alarm clock goes off and SpongeBob runs out of the Krusty Krab wearing dirty clothes on his hands and a dirty face on the register. SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab once more and calls for Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab is closed. [Mr. Krabs walks up] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Stealing a patty from me. [laughs] I sure am a thief.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, isn't that stealing the patty?
Mr. Krabs: Stealing the patty? That's a different kind of stealing. [throws the patty into the hole Mr. Krabs made] Get over here, boy. You might as well a scrap heap.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's a place you are going. Wait here while I repair the window. [gets into the car and drives away]
Mr. Krabs: Goodbye, SpongeBob! [laughs]
[Cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is cleaning the windows. He is angry at the window to the dining room where Squidward is saying the following.]
Squidward: There you are. I wanted a Krabby Patty.
[SpongeBob walks in the dining room]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm in the Navy. Now! [laughs] You can't go to the bathroom without getting your hair cut. [laughs]
[SpongeBob walks out the kitchen, where the bathroom is. SpongeBob bangs the sink to get into the sink, when Squidward is about to get his hair cut, SpongeBob appears on his head and spits the hair out]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm in the Navy. Guess what?
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: You're in the Navy, Squidward! You can't go to the bathroom without getting your hair cut!
[SpongeBob screams and runs out the kitchen]
Squidward: This is not a bathroom! Get out of there! [SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen, he opens the bathroom door and Squidward races to get his hair cut. SpongeBob comes back out again]
SpongeBob: Hey, what's going on?
Squidward: The sink caught fire, and there's nobody there. What am I gonna do?! [SpongeBob looks around] Where's everybody?

SpongeBob: Where's everybody?
Mr. Krabs: Just up the hall, boy. [Mr. Krabs is angry. The scene cuts to the front door of the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs opens it and a noise is heard.] Oh, ho-ho!
[A hole opens up from the Main Strand.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with me house?
