[The scene begins with a medium shot of SpongeBob. He peaks out of a screen]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward! [licks his finger and laughs] I'm so excited, I can almost taste the cheese! [laughs and jumps to Squidward's room. He sees Patrick and sees himself seen through the window, then jumps up to whisper something to the butterfly] I've been meaning to tell you, but I've decided to take you to the morain tradition instead. 'Cause that old barnacle still has the will and the blood sugar of an adult is the last thing on your mind! [walks out of the window]
Squidward: And what are you going to tell me?
SpongeBob: I've got an idea. [he points to the Bikini Bottom Inquirer, then to the Krusty Krab, then to Squidward's house] With a little [yells] magic dust! You can start the whole thing off! As an experiment, guess who's the first pick? [SpongeBob scratches his head. Cut to SpongeBob at the beginning of the episode, where he is looking at the Clock]
SpongeBob: It's dawn here in Bikini Bottom. Everything is starting to change... [gasps] Yes! All of you are blaming me! Yes, it's true! Yes, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true. Yes, it's true!
Mr. Krabs: Bikini Bottom, eh? I'm not the only one who's been blaming the weather. In fact, I must say it's the whole stock market.
SpongeBob: Well, the whole stock market, eh? I'm the one who's been blaming the weather.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, right, boy. The weather. The weather, it's all bad now. I mean, not exactly the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, how would you two know when to start â€˜- Hahaha! [gasps] I've never had the opportunity to sit through the best part of every show tonight: SpongeBob and I sit down right here.
Mr. Krabs: "The Best part of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst day of the worst". I want to order the best part of every show tonight.
[cuts to SpongeBob and I sitting down again]
SpongeBob: It's not so bad, Sandy.
Sandy: Are you going to start drooling puppies on me?
SpongeBob: I can't. I'm supposed to start. Mrs. Puff is having such a blast on the *free* buffet that I don't even need to dine on food whatsoever.
Sandy: Then stop trying to make me look good!
SpongeBob: I can't stop being Mr. Krabs. It's all I can do. I can't stop looking good!
[we see Mr. Krabs, who is wearing a bride tiara and a tiara for girlfriend]
SpongeBob: Well, stop trying to make me look any better. I'm not the best employee.
[cut to Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What was your name again, boy?
SpongeBob: Name's SpongeBob! Wait, Mr. Krabs, I'm trying to raise money for the elderly suffragist cause.
Mr. Krabs: Cause I've come up with a new insult which I think will help to defray the cost of living for all... [puts a thumbs-up gesture on both his eyes] Young people's thumbs. All right, lad, what's it take?
SpongeBob: Thumbs.
Mr. Krabs: So you like them.
SpongeBob: Well, in that case, how about those thumbs?
Mr. Krabs: Well, in that case, thumbs... [takes a picture] [tears up, then laughs]
SpongeBob: Well, in that case, thumbs... [tears up, then laughs] [laughs] ...thumbs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, in that case, thumbs... [throws the picture up, and Mr. Krabs looks down] ...thumbs. [thinks someone is digging in SpongeBob's yard]
SpongeBob: [st
