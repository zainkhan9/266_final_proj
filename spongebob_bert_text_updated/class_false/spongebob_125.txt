[The episode starts with the camera panning as if SpongeBob and Patrick are standing in front of a camera]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick: I'm delighted to say I've become a regular witness to his untimely passing. [SpongeBob's eyes well up with tears]
SpongeBob: What a beautiful sight. Why, I could use a lifetime supply of toothpaste.
Patrick: That would be a fine idea, too, if you wanted to use a computer.
SpongeBob: Perhaps I should work at the Krusty Krab. [scene cuts to Krusty Krab where Patrick is painting a picture of a guitar]
Patrick: And now, as a special delivery, I would be honored to work at the Chum Bucket.
Chatterbox: Okay, Mr. Tentacles, you're ready for your moment.
Mr. Tentacles: Thank you, Chatterbox.
Chatterbox: Thank you, Tentacles. [all sigh] I want to be your manager.
Customer: Alright, I want my hair done today, and put it on some picturesque paintingsheticals. [all sigh]
Mr. Tentacles: Alright, Chatterbox, time to vouch for you. [all inside the Chum Bucket, except Squidward]
Squidward: Is this what the Krusty Krab means to be? To me, a place where old Krabs gets new ones? I think we know what this place means by being its ruler. [Chuckles nervously. Scene cuts to inside the Chum Bucket where customers are chanting "Chum Bucket".]
Customers: Cham...buck...buck...
Squidward: Cham...buck...
Customer: Cham...buck...
Squidward: Cham...buck...
Mr. Krabs: Cham...buck...
Chum: Danish for "Chop Your Head". [Customers cheer]
Customers: Cham...buck...
Mr. Krabs: Cham...buck...
Chum: [in Danish] Chop Your Head!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I don't like your company, but I'm gonna stay. [both laugh]
SpongeBob: [as a waiter] Chop my head, will y'all?
Patrick: Oh, yeah! Just do it, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, hop in.
Squidward: [in French accent] Eh. [chuckles nervously]
SpongeBob: What is it, Patrick?
Patrick: I don't know. Help.
SpongeBob: Close the window.
Patrick: Close the window. [SpongeBob jumps in and opens the kitchen door]
SpongeBob: Kitchen door, I know it's not you. What are you doing?
Patrick: I don't know. I feel uncomfortable.
SpongeBob: What are you doing?
Patrick: I don't know. I feel uncomfortable. Well, wait it out. [SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, our dining area is the only place in the world where you can eat chum. Back in Texas, we have sprouted up a whole industry of their own.
Patrick: What are we going to do about it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, I'm not their manager.
