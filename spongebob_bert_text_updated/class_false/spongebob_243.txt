[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office, humming to himself.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's all the raucous talk about the Krabby Patty?! [spits] How about when Patty #2 comes back for more... [gulps] How about when Patty #3 comes back for more... [gulps] How about when Patty #4 comes back for more... [gulps] when Patty #5 comes back for more... [gulps] when Patty #6 comes back for more... [gulps]
[SpongeBob slides down in front of Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: [shows the patty] Here's your favorite, bubâ€”
Mr. Krabs: [squeezes his hands around his chest] I never had much of a career as a fry cook, until I got this letter!
[SpongeBob takes the letter and opens it.]
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab... [pauses] Where in blazes did you get this?!
Mr. Krabs: You got it, boy. It's a.K.E.P. [looks at the flower bouquet] for when #2 came back in...
SpongeBob: [whispering] Where in blazes did you get this?!
Mr. Krabs: That's when #2 came back from a trip far and away. And he's got to come back in a couple of days...
SpongeBob: But... where's #2?
Mr. Krabs: No... he doesn't seem to be in the mood... [pauses]... for adventure.
SpongeBob: [whispering] Where in blazes did you get this?!
Mr. Krabs: Well, what did I tell you about his vacation? [pauses] Oh, that. Well, it's not all bad.
SpongeBob: Oh, it's all bad!
Mr. Krabs: All bad! What are you talking about?
SpongeBob: I went to Texas as a student. I got my hands on a bunch of student loan debt.
Mr. Krabs: You mean you've got some money in your pocket that you wouldn't even bother to pay off?
SpongeBob: Yep. I even borrowed some money from a bank branch here in Bikini Bottom.
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about?
SpongeBob: Why, that is the greatest university town in the world!
Mr. Krabs: Well, thank you for that. Tell me more about me.
SpongeBob: It's a very important fact. The average Krab makes only around $2.00 a semester. If that all went up, we would have no Krusty Krab. [pointing to an ad in a local paper] But we haven't. So I've borrowed some money from the bank to help cover my student loan payments.
Mr. Krabs: Oh. So you'll stay?
SpongeBob: No. [Mr. Krabs gets excited and goes back to work yelling out loud. After five long minutes of this he stops and looks at his watch] All right, I can see where this is going. The Krusty Krab needed a new camera.
Mr. Krabs: Oh. Hmmm. This new camera could really help...
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no. [starts to cry] I mean me. But it's not about you. About me. [laughs] About me. [crying high with a sigh] me. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Me?! I'm sorry! I failed you! Oh, I'll never get this over with this minute! [SpongeBob drops crying while crying] Me shame! Me shame! Me shame! Me shame!
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs. I wasn't ready.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'm not done yet. [chuckles] So how do we get to the new location?
SpongeBob: [sticks his hands in the holes of the old Krusty Krab and revivals the Krusty Krab's cash register. He goes to the new location and eats at a nearby graveyard] Sandy's frozen egg was worth more than I could ever earn. So I made her out of me money. Now, I tell you about this place. [scene cuts to SpongeBob walking down the road] The Krusty Krab is a living nightmare. A living nightmare worse than the Krusty Krab. [SpongeBob screams as he sees a skeleton on the road and ducks] Ah, it's the Krusty Krab from the get-go.
