[Plankton is on the verge of tears in front of SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick are hiding behind a tree. Plankton is on the verge of tears]
SpongeBob: Let's keep it down in here.
Patrick: Are you gonna cry about the money?
Plankton: Yeah, I knew it. [his cry is heard more coming]
SpongeBob: Wait, come back here, you two!
Patrick: Yeah, they're crying.
Plankton: Yeah, they're crying because they're sad that their secret formula ruined their perfect.
SpongeBob: And ruined their perfect?
Patrick: Well, uh... Uh, why doesn't anybody want to know?
Plankton: Uhh... Uhh... Uhh... Uhh... [laughs] Because I don't believe there's a... [laughs again] I mean, there is a...
SpongeBob: I have a good feeling something's not right.
Plankton: Uhh, well maybe there is...
SpongeBob: Sorry, but my theory is fall back into your cupboards.
Plankton: No, sorry. [walks into his secret laboratory] I can't show you the formula, I'm not a super-intelligence.
SpongeBob: But who's that?
Plankton: You're on your own, SquarePants. Do as I say. [Squidward opens the door to his laboratory and SpongeBob and Patrick climb inside]
SpongeBob: Who's there?
Plankton: It's me, SpongeBob. I'm on an experiment. Take me back, Patrick.
Patrick: What are you doing with the technology?
Plankton: This is for my second experiment, silly. I want to show you the secret formula, not your dumb ideas. Here, use this. [shows him the secret formula] Now, draw carefully. This won't make anyone's job easy. [draws a drawing of the formula and laughs]
SpongeBob: I want to see the formula.
Plankton: Don't make me do it! Look, I just castrated a broken refrigerator.
Patrick: Oh, barnacles! I castrated a broken refrigerator!
Plankton: You mean this is for you?
SpongeBob: This is for me. This is what I've been waiting for.
Plankton: How original!
Patrick: All right! This is what I wanted before it was cast in the film.
Plankton: Gee, you think we should wait for when my mother showed up at my house?
SpongeBob: That would be me, Patrick.
Plankton: Uhh... yes.
Patrick: I want to watch the formula.
SpongeBob: How do you like it, Patrick?
Plankton: Uhh... I like it! Like I like it! Like I like it like it!
Patrick: [stomach growls] Howdy, ye welcome!
Squidward: What's this? Someone threw something in here. Can anyone help you? [the bottle rips off the bottle cap and Plankton screams]
Plankton: I can castrate myself.
[Squidward groans. Plankton spits out his chain. He spits his brain out once again and it process's like a brain. The brain regenerates itself and Plankton spits it out. He castrated himself once again and again. He castrated himself once again and again. He castrated himself once again and again. He castrated himself once again and once again. He castrated himself once again and once again. He castrated himself once again and once again.]
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, okay. I'm taking the recipe and adding in my new information technology.
Plankton: Everything's digital now.
SpongeBob: And is that you?
Plankton: Yes. SpongeBob? Everything's all right. Everything's all right.
SpongeBob: Oh, you don't look like you're in a crab's belly at all. [he walks around behind him] What am I saying?
Plankton: I'm just saying you have to be on the up and up. Don't be late. [he walks out of the laboratory] Hi, what's this?
SpongeBob: Squidward! You found your voice.
Squidward: None of my closest friends are!
SpongeBob: What are you doing, Squidward?
Squidward: I'm always on the up and on. You can't castrate me. [he stops crying]
SpongeBob: Well, what about the voice?
Squidward: Just do what I
