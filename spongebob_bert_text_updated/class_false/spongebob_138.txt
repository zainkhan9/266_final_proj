<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to work.]
SpongeBob: Oh. Hey, Patrick. How's it going?
Patrick: [walks with Patrick to the Krusty Krab] It's too quiet.
SpongeBob: Come on. Let's get moved.
Patrick: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: Just want to tell me that it's okay to be you friend in the dark.
Patrick: Oh, yeah. Just me and you in the dark. I mean, [walks away]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. I'll talk to you later.
[As he's walking, a mower comes by and mows the lawn. SpongeBob and Patrick stop mowing and take off.]
SpongeBob: Hey, you missed me!
[SpongeBob hugs Patrick. Then a piece of lawn mower debris comes down and slithers toward them, knocking them over.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, please don't put your pet in my path!
Patrick: Never mind.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick: Thanks.
SpongeBob: Thanks for the ride! Are you going to get my dark hair?
Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'll just have my hair wavy.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, you don't mean I have hair.
Patrick: Thanks.
SpongeBob: Thanks... Really?
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: No?
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: No?! [hugs Patrick as he walks away]
SpongeBob: Come on. Let's get this lawn mower off of you.
[SpongeBob has on his ear a dark spot and he looks into it.]
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my grass-encrusted ears.
[SpongeBob jumps on Patrick and he walks with him. But there is a bump on his front wheel and the bump in the middle. The A-l is a satellite dish for the antenna-shaped antenna on SpongeBob's helmet. SpongeBob goes faster and faster until he bumps into the road and he hits the A-pillar of the road. The antenna-shaped construction makes the road sound like a desert. The sand underneath the road covers the antenna-shaped construction and gives it its fantasy look. SpongeBob's speed causes him to go faster than Patrick's house and he bangs into the bell tower.]
Flying Dutchman: [calling SpongeBob]
Flying Dutchman: [singing] Where mother and daughter are united?
Patrick: [calling SpongeBob] That's where mother and daughter are?
Flying Dutchman: Who's that?
Patrick: That's my house!
Flying Dutchman: Mother's will?
Patrick: No.
Flying Dutchman: I'm getting a job as a crane!
SpongeBob: Hey! You need a crane?
Patrick: crane? Oh, yeah. I did. I'm hired. See ya! [picks them up and drives off back to their ship]
SpongeBob: Gary! You're a real good dog! [shakes Gary's hands] Aren't you, Gary?
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob stops]
SpongeBob: So long, worms! Always right after my own good things. How's your schtick, Gary?
Gary: [smiling] Meow.
[SpongeBob and Patrick go back to their ship]
SpongeBob: Gary. I'm back.
Patrick: Meow.
SpongeBob: Isn't that great, Patrick?
Patrick: [laughs] I'm back.
SpongeBob: Ooh. I wonder what happened to the flying Dutchman.
Patrick: [laughs] Ugh! Let's check this rust.
Flying Dutchman: He is not a civilian tinker.
[The Flying Dutchman turns on his radio and the band plays their song. The bug spray gunk back into his ship.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Fly! Fly! Fly!
SpongeBob: Fly!
Patrick: [The Flying Dutchman gets sprayed with all over SpongeBob and Patrick's ship] Oh, yeah. Great. Nah. [Just then, the Flying Dutchman gets sprayed with more bugs and then he flies into his ship. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run around in panic.]
Flying Dutchman: [opens his ship's hatch] I've come to take you with me, don't ya think?
Patrick: What's wrong, Flying Dutchman?
Flying Dutchman: Calm down, dagnabit! [hears a strange noise] Aah,AAAAAH! [the Flying Dutchman gets sprayed back into his ship]
Patrick: [opens his ship's hatch]
