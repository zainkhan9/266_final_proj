[Episode starts when SpongeBob and Patrick are shown eating. They are all sitting down when SpongeBob sees that Patrick is biting him. SpongeBob is biting his left arm which Patrick is biting his arm on. SpongeBob screams in fear and he jumps away. He goes back to haunt them until SpongeBob reaches into one of SpongeBob's pants and pulls out a box the size of a grain of sand.]
SpongeBob: Pat, this is Quitters.
Patrick: I am pulling my pants down!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I am not! [He pulls off his pants, ripping it off and eating the grain rocks it pulled]
Patrick: SpongeBob, we're all in trouble! [SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming. Patrick goes to pat his pants but SpongeBob takes the sandwich and lifts the pan Patrick is eating, the two eat and then they both starts eating] Mmm, patty, mmm, mmm. Yoo-hoo, Squidward. [Patrick is biting his sandwich]
Squidward: It's all right, SpongeBob. I'm just as dumb as you is. [SpongeBob drops the sandwich on the table]
SpongeBob: Oof! Oh, ow. Squidward. You made it all so much worse.
Squidward: SpongeBob, come here. [SpongeBob removes the sandwich off the table]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: What? What?
SpongeBob: I don't want to talk about it. [SpongeBob grunts] It was horrible.
Squidward: Oh, really? A trailer! [SpongeBob looks delighted]
SpongeBob: Well, come on in. [SpongeBob removes the mustard stain on the floor]
Patrick: SpongeBob, we need it.
SpongeBob: You mean the mustard stain?
Patrick: [Looks horrified] Not the stain. [SpongeBob removes the mustard stain and holds up a tiny salad bar] It can't possibly last. One minute, here we are. Time to head back. [walks off] Idiot trash. [walks up to a matching hat] Happy trails. Good people. [Patrick notices he's being followed] Patrick? Patrick?
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. Nobody eats me when I go to the Krusty Krab when they see I'm gone. Hey, when they see I'm gone, they think I'm some kind of stinky, rotten brain! [They lower the lid as he slides over to the other side] So, they're gonna eat you. Hey, now you when they see I'm gone... [jumps off the table and trips over a barrel on the table] Hey, now you when they see I'm gone? Yeah, now you when they see I'm gone. [Patrick lands in his chair on the floor]
Patrick: Okay, I'm on my way to Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: You're not on my bus.
Patrick: That's okay, I've got plenty of free Krabby Patties. [SpongeBob walks off and returns with a tray of three Krabby Patties]
SpongeBob: Well, what about the Krabby Patties?
Patrick: Wouldn't want to upset your host, eh?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick.
Patrick: [gulps] I'm late".
SpongeBob: Oh. [he walks off. He is surrounded by various fishes. He screams and runs into the kitchen] I can't leave them now.
Patrick: Please don't run off the handle. It'll eat you. [throws the food in a vat of soda and puts him in a straw] Hey, SpongeBob. How would you like to stay?
SpongeBob: [babbles and stops] Sorry. [thinks for a second] I'm not an eater. I like Krabby Patties. [laughs] But I don't like them Krabby Patties. I don't... like... them Krabby Patties. SpongeBob? [The fish walks off] SpongeBob? [The end product is shown. The word "PULL" comes out of it. The cash register is shown.] [offscreen] WHERE IS THAT!?" [The camera moves to a small area with a lowmening computer screen. A stereo microphone is shown.] Somewhere, there's a little girlfish who, over the noise of the outside, will dare say the word "knock". That's what it says, right there: "KOLACHO!!!". [The girls laugh. The computer screen shows a static image of the Krusty Krab. The computer screen fades to a wide shot of the building. The
