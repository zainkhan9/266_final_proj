Narrator: More SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is at the Krusty Krab with customers and cheerfully approaches a customer] Faster, SpongeBob! [Ammo falls off a table]
Mr. Krabs: There you are! [SpongeBob leaps up and salutes Sir Quentin Mr. Krabs. Sir Quentin applauds] Good evening, sir. I must state something, clearly and simply. My client wants to impress you.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't be bothered to explain the name yet, but I must be able to tell when you've done your time. [Mr. Krabs takes away his name]
SpongeBob: That's it, I've got it! I'll get my very own name! [SpongeBob takes away his very own name]
Mr. Krabs: [rests on his chair and gibbers] All right, that should it. I suppose I have you on the case.
SpongeBob: What is it?
Mr. Krabs: It's me new crime fighter name. It's the name of the new antidote to appetites. It's a discovery-repper. Well, I think I have a solution. [He looks at SpongeBob's mouth]
SpongeBob: What do you think?
Mr. Krabs: I think I have a solution for you, now pay up. [He holds up his whip] See ya, SpongeBob!
Patrick: [Throws a paper bag filled with popcorn and milk into his mouth] Hey, gee, that's not the name of the restaurant.
Mr. Krabs: It is?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's not it. I'm getting SpongeBob on the case.
Patrick: That's it, I've got it.
Mr. Krabs: Your case, officer! Look. [He slaps SpongeBob on the back] There you are, SpongeBob.
Patrick: Thanks.
Mr. Krabs: Officer, I think I've got the name.
Police Officer: No problem, buddy. You can borrow my trash.
Mr. Krabs: Officer, you made me do it.
Police Officer: What? [She slaps the popcorn and milk cans] You did?
Mr. Krabs: No. [They both go inside the kitchen. When they are done, they step out to dance and the cash register recycles by the door.]
