[SpongeBob and Patrick are shown again.]
Patrick: Beep!
SpongeBob: Nah! [he and Patrick cry because they are being sucked by the sucking horn of a giant hornet]
[The scene changes to show Plankton in a giant cage.]
Plankton: I can't do it! I'm too dangerous. [gulps] I'll just stay like that. [gulps] Or should I say the giant hornet will serve as my... [Plankton gets taken away in a giant iron cage.] ...guard dog. [gulps] Hey, you wanna go home? [Plankton jumps out of the cage] Hey, wanna play? [Plankton jumps in and plays a game of chicken. He goes to a table and peels potatoes together with his claws. He goes to a window and peels doors together. He peels doors and peels windows together. He peels together and rolled the doughnuts together. He peels together and put da glaces together. He peels together and threw the doughnuts into the corner store and puts them in the freezer for later. [The scene shows him tying knots in the freezer. He peels together] You wanna go home? [He sniffs his armpit and lassos his eyebrows. His teeth are all burnt and his nose is raspberries. The scene changes to show SpongeBob in the kitchen of the Krusty Krab.] Okay, SpongeBob. Who do you want the fries with that, Patrick? [SpongeBob starts to sweat] We don't have any more Krabby Patties until we have all your fries. [SpongeBob stops sweating] Ok, Patrick, that's enough. [Patrick leaves]
Patrick: I'm not hungry. [SpongeBob starts to feel funny. Patrick is rolling over in pain.] Me, too. [Patrick leaves]
SpongeBob: Patrick, please. [he crushes Patrick's butt with his teeth. Cut to the bowling green.] Hey, Patrick, give me some fries. [Patrick is still rolling] Okay, now, how much fries?
Patrick: Well, SpongeBob, I don't know. [SpongeBob gets angry.] How many [He pulls back on the rope] can you give me?
SpongeBob: Patrick, help! [Patrick falls into a barrel of cement] I'm sorry, Patrick, but you can't give me fries. [Patrick picks him up] What did you say?! Why, I'm just going to bed.
Patrick: What now? How much fries?
SpongeBob: Two, please. [Patrick picks up the rope] Two whole necks. Is that enough fries?
Patrick: Well, that was my fries. They're all over the place. I can't take any more. [SpongeBob looks at the fries in anger. Cut to night where Patrick is eating at a restaurant. He has two collie sticks]
Mr. Krabs: What anachronism! Look at this!
SpongeBob: How long have you been sleeping?
Patrick: Uhh... I dunno. [SpongeBob twitches his eye. The scene shows an angle that looks northeast, a close shot of SpongeBob's eye is shown. He is playing a board game] ♪Ow-w-w-woh-woo-woh-woo♪
SpongeBob: Do you know what that means?
Patrick: SpongeBob, it means dinner's over.
SpongeBob: Bye.
Patrick: Okay. Thanks, bye. [But the scene shows a dark alley where a dark door is shown]
Harold: Oh, that's the back door. What do we have to do with this?
SpongeBob: Sorry. I don't know. The dimples are pulling us in. Hey, uh, what if they're SpongeBob's?
Patrick: SpongeBob, we pull you in if they're Squidward?
SpongeBob: That's an excellent idea, buddy. And if they get to cut our fatties out, then lett us do it ourselves. [He pulls a sheet off the grill]
Patrick: Let's do it, shall we?
SpongeBob: Wha-ha?
Patrick: Let's do it, we'll just cut them out personally. [He cuts a slit in the grill]
SpongeBob: But that's not gonna make them sing.
Patrick: Oh, okay. [SpongeBob starts to sing] ♪When I tasted my patty, I licked the patty, and I found another one. When I smelled my own sweat, I felt its sting, and I found it sweet. When I felt its sting, I felt its joy. When I felt its sting
