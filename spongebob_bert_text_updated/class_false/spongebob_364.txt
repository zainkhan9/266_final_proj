[The camera zooms in on SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Say hello to...
Squidward: [sighs] I love hearing your tale.
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Patrick: When are you going to tell me your secret?
SpongeBob: Two, three, four...
Squidward: Relax, it's an emergency. Only one SpongeBob can save you! You have to inform the citizens your secret.
[SpongeBob walks over to Squidward]
SpongeBob: [slams the door on SpongeBob's side] What's wrong, Squidward? Don't you know that you're gonna be working here for a very, very long time? Especially with me out of the kitchen.
[Squidward starts to sob. SpongeBob runs off]
SpongeBob: That's okay, Squidward, I'm here to help.
[SpongeBob's boots flatten out on the floor. The scene shifts to show that the back of Squidward's kitchen is shown.]
Squidward: Thanks. I can fix this! [An x-ray is shown on Squidward's hand. Squidward groans.] What's the matter, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [barges up the kitchen table] That's what I was saying. You should be able to return for a while, just not while you... [reveals his un-surprise] ...make me feel better.
[a montage begins]
Montage: SpongeBob Returns as Pattabaco to the Krusty Krab
Squidward: Well, that oughta' solve itself.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That's a great idea!
[the montage fades to the background. Squidward is lying on his face peacefully]
Squidward: And now, poetry. [SpongeBob is shown under the table]
SpongeBob: I love poetry, Squidward. [licks the paper] He does. [Squidward cries, ending the episode]
