[The scene begins with the opening title card that opens up on the comic book.]
Flying Dutchman: Welcome to the Flying Dutchman's comic-book recital! With a never-before-seen X-Ray. [The scene shows the X-Rays that SpongeBob has been using are shown at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob chants a few times] Yee-heeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee.
[The scene returns to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Why is the name of this letter "Flying Dutchman" on the front page of the paper?
Flying Dutchman: It's for my advanced age-assistance. Now, come on.
SpongeBob: Really?
Flying Dutchman: I'm not old-ass anymore. I'm... you! [SpongeBob starts crying and Squidward starts to dislike SpongeBob's crying]
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you crying about?
SpongeBob: The name's Flying Dutchman. I came to the Flying Dutchman for his advanced looks, remember?
Squidward: Advanced looks? Right, now get 'em before I cry!
[Flying Dutchman looks very angry. He growls and smacks SpongeBob over and over until he stops. SpongeBob becomes even more angry than before. SpongeBob starts to cry and drops his pants. Dutchman starts to shout "Uhhh...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" vwieaaav.]
SpongeBob: Aw, dee, duh, don't do that. It's not going to go down so well.
Flying Dutchman: Why are you doing that?
SpongeBob: 'cause I like you.
Flying Dutchman: Well, you. You know. Laugh yourstown before you cry.
[Flying Dutchman starts to cry. SpongeBob starts to laugh as well. Dutchman's eyes turn into coins so they can be in a fake money bag.]
SpongeBob: You know, you could be undercover police officer Squidward. [The scene changes to show Squidward in a police outfit, with handcuffs on him and a metal cuffs on his head. He is pushed onto the floor and has handcuffs fasten with a bar. SpongeBob runs to him and pulls his lips together.] 
Squidward: Thanks. 
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That looks pretty nice. 
[SpongeBob puts on his police hat and cuffs Squidward. He goes to the kitchen and opens the kitchen door. He yawns and sits down. Then he walks over to the freezer, which is almost the same size as him. He opens it up and reveals a small freezer on the wall. He closes it and walks to the sink. He looks at the next item and says, "The sink should help me sleep here." The next scene begins.]
Flying Dutchman: Here we go. Some ketchup. 
[SpongeBob does the same thing with the rest of the meals. He gently caresses the stuff.] 
Squidward: Nuh-uh. These are the best. 
SpongeBob: Ah, the freezing treatment. This is exactly the kind of thing you don't happen to like, Squidward. I'm gonna... sneak these out of me kitchen. 
[Squidward makes a disgusted face, then leaves.] 
Patrick: [imitating Squidward] I'd never... 
Flying Dutchman: [imitates Squidward] Nuh-uh, these people are too slow. They should be listened to. [He slowly creeps out of the freezer, while also sneaking out one by one, all the meals out. He eventually finds them. One by one, he reveals where the food storage closet is. He smiles. The unseen Patrick hides in it and SpongeBob and Squidward follow him. They both scream and run away. A police officer comes in.]
Flying Dutchman: These people deserve to live. [He whispers into SpongeBob's ear.] You don't see that everyday. You don't see a thing.
SpongeBob: You did. [He walks over to a plant and sticks his tongue out. The unseen Patrick finds it and crawls down it.] I'll save you, Patrick. [He pulls SpongeBob off of him and SpongeBob stands up.] Get off of me! [Patrick grabs him and pulls him towards the Flying Dutchman. SpongeBob walks over and sits him down.] Okay, Patrick, this is a tricky one.
Patrick: Easy, huh?
SpongeBob: You're it?
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Uh, this is...
Flying Dutchman: Are you trying to tell me to leave?
SpongeBob: No, that's not what I said.
