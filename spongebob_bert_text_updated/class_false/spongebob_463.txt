[The scene widens to the backdrops of Bikini Bottom. Above it, there is a waterfall, several castles, several tall mountains, and still more clouds.]
Narrator: [tweeted] Amazing! (SpongeBob and Squidward were playing on both their backs) And here's a fun fact: Mr. SquarePants only has himself to thank for all his free stuff. [SpongeBob's and Squidward's backs start to boil]
SpongeBob: I knew I'd like my free stuff.
Squidward: Uhh... I'll never get it, Mr. Big Daddy. Your bath stuff will be right here.
Mr. Krabs: Well, here's my free bath cauldron! [Mr. Krabs gets a steam engine and starts driving it around the cabin with it]
SpongeBob: Hmmm... what do you love better? The water or the puddle on the grill?
Mr. Krabs: Neither. [turns the knob to nitwit and suddenly screams] There is absolutely no water better! I spent twenty years in the Navy, and I finally understand the distinction between a lousy water and a lousy grill.
SpongeBob: Well, I love better.
Mr. Krabs: [NWS worker fish pants] What we've got here is a slippery opponent.
SpongeBob: [Goes over the water] Hey, you're gonna need some air.
Mr. Krabs: If I can only pull one out. [SpongeBob pulls the rope]                                                                                   There is NO water better!
SpongeBob: But if I can't pull one out, who will?
Mr. Krabs: None. [SpongeBob pulls]
SpongeBob: Uh... huh... [Mr. Krabs pulls a wall]
Mr. Krabs: None. [Plugs a hole] Construction workers, please! What we have here is illegal! [He charges at SpongeBob]                                                                   $250!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we have to get this over with. [Back up] Up-smanship!
Mr. Krabs: That's not what this is about. I could talk about this for hours, but you've got to get this work done by this time next year. [Scene switches to SpongeBob and Squidward outside the cabin]
SpongeBob: What do we do, Squidward? How do we get to the door?
Squidward: Figure out what's going on here? [screams] Abandon this vehicle! [opens the door and loads a large sack out from under it] I'll free it from this dirty old wheel! [puts the sack in a bag] I'll free it from this dirty old wheel! [Shows a large sack with a handle on it] I'll free it from this dirty old wheel! [Shows a woman being held on a pole with a sack in her hand] I'll free it from this dirty old wheel! [Shows a large group of prisoners with their bellies full of bails] I'll free it from this dirty old wheel! [Shows a large group of SpongeBobs who are gangbanging another one. SpongeBob then gives the sack to Patrick who is going to steal it]
Patrick: Patrick, you've done it! [starts to cry]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, you've done it!
Patrick: What have I done?! [SpongeBob then pulls the lever down and a drum kicks off and Patrick gets knocked out as the big knocks the mini SpongeBob on its bed with a loud thud. Picture is of a bed with two beds, one on each side of the door.]
Nancy: It's night time. [thinks about stealing the bed] SpongeBob, how are you feeling today?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm so happy that I'm here to say that I have no friends to keep! [A nice long bath were you had] Why don't you get a bath now? And don't you get a Bath what now? [gets in bed and moans] I don't know what to do, but take a bath now! [lounges on the tub and lathers it all up]
Patrick: Hey, what's that horrible stench?
SpongeBob: [laughs] I can't remember. Uh... [takes off his bathing hat and rubs it on the floor] Bad as this smell is, it makes me giggle. [SpongeBob gets in bed] I don't know what to do, but I've got to do it! [SpongeBob takes off his night cap and gets into bed]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, look! I know this bathroom. [
