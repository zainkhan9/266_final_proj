[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible. [hops onto the cash register and opens it] There he is!
[The cash register falls down. Mr. Krabs sees SpongeBob with the extra big kitchen sink and runs around laughing.]
Mr. Krabs: Don't tell me you forgot the condiments!
[SpongeBob continues to laugh. The episode begins with Mr. Krabs bashes the kitchen window hard in SpongeBob's face.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you idiot! You just bashed my window!
[SpongeBob looks out the window and sees Mr. Krabs following him.]
SpongeBob: Well, you might wanna come back later if you can. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Okay. Good luck.
[Mr. Krabs leaves the door open and resumes driving. But a bump is coming from Mr. Krabs's approaching the bump.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh!
[A passing driver passes by and starts honking his horn. Police cars honk their horns. Aldebuts start honking their horns too.]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Oh!
SpongeBob: Ah!
[Mr. Krabs honks his horn while honking his horn drive system. But the horn drive crashes into Sandy's car. Police cars stop and pass by, too.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
[SpongeBob screams as Mr. Krabs hits him in the face. The steering wheel of his police car flips Mr. Krabs around. Mr. Krabs pulls the lever, blasts through the opening in Mr. Krabs' police car and sends debris crashing through the windows. Back in the kitchen, Squidward is putting sombre chum on a spatula. He turns on the heaters and sees a plate of 10 chum patties on a plate of buns. He gives it a taste of his famous sombrero and chuckles.]
Squidward: [grossed] ugh! [his mouth rips out of his mouth] This week's topics of conversation are running with the bubbles, running with cayenne, and... [his eyes rip out] Ugh.
[The episode ends with everyone laughing.]
