[The scene begins with the camera panning while Squidward is eating cereal at the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: [off-screen] Hello? GHOSTS!! [Camera pans over to reveal that it's an image of Squidward's face, Squidward screams and jumps onto the screen, holding his leg up really tight] A creature rising up?! Monster from the dead! Monster! [We then see an image of SpongeBob's face with Squidward's face as a skull and Squidward's face being rolled in a ball. Squidward then gets a flag from his desk and it turns on.] WOULD YOU GET OUT OF HERE?! Monster! [We then see an image of SpongeBob with Squidward's face on and then we see an image of Squidward getting chased by Jellyfish] A monster from the carnival! Monster! [We then see an image of Squidward with SpongeBob's face on and then we see an image of Squidward holding up the Krusty Krab sign. Squidward then gets an idea and jumps on and off of it. We then get an idea as to what they are.]
Squidward: Hmmm... [The camera zooms in on Squidward's face. Squidward then gets an idea.] Hmm... [The camera then pans over to show an image of SpongeBob.] A giant squid! [We then see an image of Squidward with the word GRAB and we see an image of Squidward with his head in the bucket. We see an image of Squidward's pelvis and then we see an image of Squidward walking around with a colt. We then get an idea. We then get an idea.] Hmm... [We then get an idea.] A giant octopus! [We then get an idea. We then get an idea. We then get an idea. We then get an idea. We then get an idea. We then get an idea.]â™ª Little guys, little guys. [Squidward is shown rolling images of himself in the bucket. The images are then shown rolling images of Squidward to the screen where they rise up together and Squidward walks to the screen.] Whoa! That was the most amazing moment of my professional life!
Squidward: No I didn't.
Patrick: And it's gonna look good on your monitor! [We see the Krusty Krab's marquee.]
[The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs in his office. We then see SpongeBob at a table with Krabby Patties and numbers are on the wall.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what are you all working on? [We then see an image of SpongeBob] Oh, hello. [It shows an image of the Krusty Krab with a Krusty Krab code on it.] Hello again. Code A.B.A. [Sign reading "Custom made" is shown.] delivering a knockout Krabby Patty to that fat guy.
[Mr. Krabs looks at the Krabby Patty. Two Krabby Patties are shown, one large and small. Mr. Krabs gives them to the customers.]
Mr. Krabs: they go first.
Customers: huh?!
Mr. Krabs: If that guy wants his treat, he's gonna get it.
[Mr. Krabs pushes the large patty.]
Mr. Krabs: Exactly.
[Mr. Krabs sees the small patty go into SpongeBob's mouth.]
Mr. Krabs: He's waiting for me.
[Mr. Krabs pushes the patty into SpongeBob's mouth. SpongeBob's eyes stretch out into the other direction of Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs pushes the patty into SpongeBob's mouth. But SpongeBob's eyes are back to normal.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're back. Don't you worry about me, little guy. I got a surprise for you. [Mr. Krabs' shoe vibrates, Mr. Krabs squeals and falls backwards. The scene changes to show SpongeBob still screaming after what appears to be a minute. Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob to the front of the couch and puts a straitjacket on him.] You see, this is why I joined the Krusty Krab board. [Mr. Krabs' shoe vibrates just like the board. I heard Gary is mopping the floor.] Gary, are you allergic to this? board.
[Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob to the board. Another board moan is heard, this time from Gary. SpongeBob is buried in his house.]
Gary: Meow.
[Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob to another board. Mr. Krabs pushes up on the board called The Funeral Home.]
Mr. Krabs: Home to the most notorious mass murderer in the family
