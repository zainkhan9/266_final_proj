[The scene switches to Squidward's house during the night. It is night time and the sun is rising.]
Squidward: Oh, why must every last citizen have a seat at the table at the foot of the...Ups and Downs. [A door labeled "Bar" locks and pokes a hole so the crowd can in.] My bed, Mr. Krabs can sit his mind at his side. And Mr. Krabs can sit next to me when I'm bored. Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry. [Mr. Krabs sits on his chair across from me]
Mr. Krabs: And let me tell you about my day. [SpongeBob turns to Patrick]
Patrick: Fifty years old? That's a long time for [He turns to show an old chair] to have been.
Mr. Krabs: [mad] Go away! What do I have to do?? [He sits again]
Patrick: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [mad] Oh, aren't you coming to my house soon? [He sits back down] I'm not leaving this spot until Mr. Krabs gets paid. [He starts to sweat] Come here, you. [He lifts up a chair, Patrick starts to inhale, then stops] Ah...nice...latentellar. [He zooms to the door then we see a crowd of people in the back of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: So, what do you think?
Evelyn: I like Krabs better!
Squidward: Money's no good here, aren't you?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm not here to see 'em. [He walks forward] I'm here to meet 'em. [He walks backwards. Velyn and Patrick look towards the crowd]
Patrick: We like Krabs better!
SpongeBob: We like Krabs better!
Hawthorne: Isn't it funny, Mr. Krabs, that our old people have come a long way since I came to Bikini Bottom?
Mr. Krabs: No, it's not funny, it's what we can do!
All: What?
Mr. Krabs: [whispers] The treasures of the ocean.

Mr. Krabs: [whispers] Come on, honey, it's a lot easier than you think!
[Cut to the empty plate of food]
Nat: I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, Krabby! Mr. Krabs! [She looks at the plate, then to Mr. Krabs] Please don't keep that sandwich secret! We need to get it out of the hands of a few unhinged fish! [They both look at the plate, then SpongeBob grabs it then puts it back onto the table] Thanks, boyo.
SpongeBob: I can't see the bottom of the sandwich.
Patrick: SpongeBob, the top's on the bottom!
SpongeBob: Well, um...
Squidward: [to Harold] I hate to precipitate on your work party, but you better not be late about, Harold, but it's a little stormy.
Harold: Billy up, chap.
SpongeBob: Come on, Harold, let's go get some food.
 [cut to later]
Harold: Me next.
Squidward: Hunt you down.
 [later at the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Well, Krabs, and his conga line. Where's Plankton?
Frank: He's been gone for weeks.
Plankton: He confiscated the Krabby Patty formula from Mr. Krabs last night. He's been absent all week.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's nothing to fuss over, Plankton. In fact, why don't you show me all your patties? [cut to a view of the Krusty Krab with a rainbow above and a sign that reads 'WELCOME KRABBY']
Plankton: Hey there, Chum Bucket boy! Just sitting at home, crunching patties for your friends.
Frank: Me, too. I wanted to show off my patties, but it's too cute.
[cuts to Plankton, smiling, looking milked and fried]
Plankton: [laughs]
