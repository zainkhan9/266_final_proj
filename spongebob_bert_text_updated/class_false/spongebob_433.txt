[The episode begins with a group of strange creatures that come to the Krusty Krab and eating squid. The octopus takes a bite out of a Krabby Patty. He tastes it and spits it out.]
Squidward: That's right, SpongeBob! I would not eat that in a normal lifetime!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Squidward's on the case.
Squidward: Wait, would you do the same? If you wish to speak to Mr. Krabs, please refer to [Mr. Krabs walks off] Meet Squidy!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, boy, this is the last straw. I [stares at him] Will require ID.
Squidward: If I wanted to know who you are...
Mr. Krabs: Identity? Well, if you would like to know who you are, [points at him] wait here. [walks off]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, Mr. Krabs is never wrong.
Squidward: Alright, I must face my destiny. [bubble transition to Mr. Krabs like a gun] The Krusty Krab is rusted and malnourished. The children are dying. The adults are getting away from it. Criminals are crossing the border into this country.
Mr. Krabs:   Here we go, uh,   the   evildoer.
[bubble transition to a table filled with Krabby Patties. One large patty is displayed]
Mr. Krabs: Bold, bold, delicious.   here we go,   the tartar sauce.
Squidward: Uh, let's see.   Oh, it's all official.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, here it is. [notices tartar sauce in a cup] tartar sauce ready!
Squidward: Yes, sir.   Oh, tartar sauce. Excellent.
Mr. Krabs: Is it true?
Squidward: It's a pattie's-apprehension. Tartar sauce, uh, is what they put in the trifle.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right.
[bubble transition to a glass of buns]
Mr. Krabs: Here we go, uh, the macaroons. I want this bright red bun to taste better. Understand?
Squidward: Well, I think not.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
Squidward: Oh, I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.
SpongeBob: [talking to Squidward] And that's how I got my license. [notices the written bloodstain on the patty] Huh? That's a bloodstain!
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: And you're still on the illegal list.
Squidward: We are not on the illegal list. [tries to take the patty] But you can apply to us change. [SpongeBob takes the patty]
SpongeBob: But what about my license? I am not on the illegal list.
[bubble transition to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: But, sir, the Department of Fish, Food, and Ticket officers also come into play. [the old lady plays a minor instrument] If I have to play a note, I'm gonna play more. [plays more notes] Go, SpongeBob, go, SpongeBob, go!
[bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' office]
SpongeBob: D'oh!
Mr. Krabs: May I help you, boys?
Tom: I'll take the pencil.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, boys? You got a lot of work to do.
Tom: Yeah, you know. Unless you shut that fat one up.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] I could get used to you working here. And me not being on vacation is just fine.
SpongeBob: Boys, this is the worst shift of the day.
Mr. Krabs: If that's you, then I expect a full day's work at the Krusty Krab.
Bubble Transition: At the Krusty Krab. [Mr. Krabs is behind him]
Mr. Krabs: Where are we? In the dining room? [notices the pencil] Oh! My lunch's ready.
[bubble transition to the back of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Mr. Kr
