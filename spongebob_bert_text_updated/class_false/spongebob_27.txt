[At a fortune cookie farm, the girls are shown giving a bunch of money to a "gift" that says "I wish you'd [gives them a piece of this] Cake." One of them is shown giving the cake to her friend, who's in the water, and the other one is shown giving the cake to a giant fish that they're riding in the boat that's at the top of the raft that the girls are going on]
Pearl: [they give the cake to her friend] Thank you, giant!
Pearl and the giant fish: [they give the cake to Pearl] You're welcome.
[The girls go on a camping trip. The girls find a cave that they think is the Krusty Krab. They go inside it and enter it. They enter the front door and enter the bathroom. They enter the bathroom again and enter the kitchen and the tent. They enter the sink and enter the freezer and enter the cake stand.]
Pearl: [she notices the cake stand and gasps] Huh? [grabs the cake]
Pearl: [the cake stand with the key inside it] That's it, SpongeBob. We're coming down here to take care of your... [SpongeBob points to the cake stand with the key] ...disease needs.
SpongeBob: [panting] Ooh, I'm coming down here!
Pearl: [the cake stand with the key] Great, SpongeBob. I think we have everything on my list. [SpongeBob opens the box that the girls are in and takes out a box labeled "Krusty Krab" The girls head down to the front door to SpongeBob] I need you to...
SpongeBob: ...Give me the cake! [they run into the cave and they come out wearing green outfits]
Pearl: I'll go get the cake.
SpongeBob: ...Go.
Pearl: [they turn around and they run into the kitchen] SpongeBob, did you get the cake yet?
SpongeBob: Oh, I did. I still have a lot of work to do.
[They stop running and SpongeBob gets back up with a bucket of grease]
SpongeBob: But I wanted to get the bucket of grease the girls left behind.
Pearl: Right, right, right.
SpongeBob: Um, why would they leave behind a box?
Pearl: [her head spins] Because the grime on your bucket is so... [SpongeBob gasps] ...gross!
SpongeBob: [panting] Oh, I will! I will get that grease back into the wild!
[SpongeBob lets out a small squeaking noise]
Pearl: Guys, thanks for coming. [heads left]
SpongeBob: Guys, what time are you gonna...
Pearl: Oh, whale, sure, dude.
SpongeBob: [fin' arrives] Hey, Pearl.
Pearl: You know what I don't understand?
SpongeBob: You guys really need to come back soon.
Pearl: I'm not buying it, SpongeBob. If you want your friends to stay, I need you to bring them here.
SpongeBob: [prepares to leave, but stops] Oh, wait. That... [head closes door for a second, then reveals the word "return"] ...returnation.
Pearl: You mean...
SpongeBob: That I'm notreturning...
Pearl: [notices the box] Huh...?
SpongeBob: [tries to peek in the box, but fails] Head on out.
[They enter the box and see SpongeBob looking at a coral tree]
SpongeBob: Oh boy! This is the best SpongeBob ever!
[They exit the box and they head back to the lodge]
SpongeBob and Pearl: You...
SpongeBob: ...should've known! This isn't the Best SpongeBob!
[They scream, and the girls yell. The screaming is so loud, it causes the girls to bounce on the coral tree and get hit by the incoming needles. The girls spin around and bounce away before getting hit by the incoming needles. The girls do so several times, and one of them sends her spinning through the air.]
Pearl: Spin... off? [the girls spin around and bounce]
SpongeBob: [hits the box in the head] Ow.
[The box lands on the ground next to a family of three very similar to SpongeBob and Squidward. The family members laugh, while the boys continue to laugh. The family members laugh even harder than Squidward, but still they laugh like they're laughing.]
Cousin: Daddy, we've got to apologize
