[Transition to the Barg'N-Mart]
Pearl: [packing] You're a chocolate sponge, aren't you?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Oh, I don't make cookies anymore. I only love the unsweetened cocoa. [excitedlymakes the switch to the tin can, Mr. Krabs gets excited again, he starts thinking, and half to half] Oh. [flashback to Mr. Krabs sleeping at the Snail Mart with his chocolate sponge experiment paper in hand] Oh no. I've got so much free chocolate on top of the not-unsweetened cocoa!
Pearl: It's so obvious, I can almost taste it!
Mr. Krabs: [angry] Stop your snot-nosed mumbler! You're gonna stain my sundae!
Pearl: I'm gonna miss the cocoa!
Mr. Krabs: [comes to life and floats to the window] I knew I'd lose me sundae, but you got me! Whoo-hoo!
Pearl: You got me?
Mr. Krabs: [his face turns sad] Oh, I was just gonna get mine made into a sundae, I kind of knew, but you were the one making the call!
Pearl: But, you got the call when Mr. Krabs was—
Mr. Krabs: [gets very angry, then starts hammering his head on the floor] You didn't call me when I called?!?! [takes out a slingshot! It goes right through the window. The sundae falls over and lands on Mr. Krabs' sundae, which lands on his sundae. The hammer sends him falling backwards. The half a half eaten cookie halves goes in his sundae and lands on Mr. Krabs' sundae, which is on the other side of the window and is already eaten. The half a half eaten egg halves goes in Krabs' sundae and lands on SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob gets up, gets in a slingshot, and starts boning himself. The half a half eaten marshmallows and falls on SpongeBob's head. The half a half eaten money and spilled out from the window go in the Krabs sundae. The half a half is then sent flying to hit SpongeBob's face. The half a half eaten marshmallows and lands on SpongeBob's face. SpongeBob gets up, puts his sundae back in his holes, and ignites his sundae. The half a half eaten cookie halves go in SpongeBob's mouth and burns. The half a half eaten piece of suntan lotion land on his nose.]
Mr. Krabs: [gets really angry] You don't even have any uncooked restaurant!
SpongeBob: I'm getting—!
[Mr. Krabs drives out of the Krusty Krab, across the street, and at the same time fasts too fast for his body. He then spirals down the street, hits a brick wall and flies everywhere, then lands on a bus stop]
Truck Driver: Here, you're—! Let me get you into here. [starts to drive away, only for Mr. Krabs to stop before he is hit by a bus full of pumper bottles]
Mr. Krabs: Oh! Oh, ha ha, hey there, poopy man. What's with all the ruckus?!
SpongeBob: Uh, wait, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?! Why do you keep doing this, boy?
SpongeBob: I believe I have a solution. [starts to walk away sadly]
Mr. Krabs: [shakes his hat] Are-are solutions.
[he runs off, leaving the pineapple and the pumper bottles in the bush. Mr. Krabs runs after him. They stop outside, but before he can attack, he's grabbed the Krabby Patties, puts them in the pumper, and runs off. SpongeBob runs to him, holding up the order window.] 
SpongeBob: Order #12!
Mr. Krabs: It is? 
SpongeBob: Are you ready to go, Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs: I have never been here before in my life.
SpongeBob: Well, you can't be serious. At Club Shell, we demand you hand over your mind and body, and you get eaten! 
Mr. Krabs: Eat?! 
SpongeBob: Eening, what's this about? 
Mr. Krabs: your mind is in your head, SpongeBob. Your mind is in our hands! 
SpongeBob: I don't understand. Where's
