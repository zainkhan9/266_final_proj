SpongeBob: [in the bathroom, waking up from a dream] Huh? What the...? What?! Oh, I gotta go to my concert! [almost slips on the glass, but was launched up onto the glass and landed on his head] Oh, my head, what is that on your head?! [Patrick is listening from out of his window]
Patrick: Well, that's not right. It appears my brain was splintering.
SpongeBob: I don't know what you mean. [SpongeBob is removing the glass that is sticking out on the windshield]
Patrick: I don't see what you're trying to do... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh, I believe I'm removing glass for good. [SpongeBob is wiping the windshield on a mirror] How about your second, third and last?
Patrick: How about my chance to win a million? [Patrick puts his hand on SpongeBob's hard shell]
SpongeBob: Well, first I'll take your second and I'll erase all your traces.
Patrick: My chance...? What do you want?
SpongeBob: Well, I just wanted to tell you that I'm not just like all your other friends... [SpongeBob has hair on his hands and is wearing a visor] ...I'm very good at translating certain words. 'Cause they come from the Greek "SpongeBob Sponge," [translated from the Old King English into French version, literally "SpongeBob SpongeBob."]
Old King: Gather round to witness my divinities.
Dirty King: Oh, I fancied myself the new king.
Old King: How could I forget?
Dirty King: You've been holding my divinities at bay for years. return to me![Dirty King throws SpongeBob and Patrick, knocking them into the ground and hopping on their backs]
All: Ahh!
SpongeBob: [disoriented] Noooo!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob walking to work. He notices a strange man walking by the roadside.]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. That's the guy you see in the movies with... [annoyed growls] ...greasy coots. [maniacal laughter fills the air] Come on, bro. Let's go home.
Frank: [chuckles] Nice day, bro.
SpongeBob: Well, goodbye after 3. Let's skip to the Krusty Krab. [leans to the left then right hand corner] There we go. [SpongeBob and Patrick walk to the Krusty Krab] Hmm... Where's the shell that once paralyzed me? [looks through the window and sees a shell that resembles Patrick's, Squidward's, or Mr. Krabs' house. SpongeBob and Patrick's houses are flying everywhere] Uh-oh. [separates himself] The shell on his head is a strange green color. [SpongeBob and Patrick's houses fly the shell] Ohh... [separates himself] The shell on his head is a violet color. [SpongeBob's houses disappear] Huh? [separates himself] The shell on his head is a yellow color. [SpongeBob's houses reappear floating in the middle of the floorboards, with heads] Ooh! a weird looking bead of sand! [SpongeBob or Patrick's houses giggle and shiver] This is frightening! [SpongeBob or Patrick's houses giggle, and spin around SpongeBob's house as if he's watching] This is just ridiculous! [SpongeBob or Patrick's houses giggle, and spin around Patrick's ladder as if he's listening. SpongeBob or Patrick's houses giggle, and spin around Squidward's house as if he's listening. SpongeBob or Patrick's houses giggle, and shiver] This is just ridiculous! [SpongeBob or Patrick's houses giggle, and spin around the Chum Bucket as if it's a lake] This is just ridiculous! [SpongeBob or Patrick's houses giggle, and go towards Squidward and Mr. Krabs] Stop this immediately! [SpongeBob or Patrick's houses fly around SpongeBob's house] This is just ridiculous! [SpongeBob or Patrick's houses giggle, and go towards Patrick, who is about to knock on the door] Patrick! [Patrick laughs, but his nose is ripped off]
Patrick: How are we gonna find your house?
SpongeBob: If we go this far, we may as well end up in jail! [cut to the Pen Palooza where SpongeBob and Patrick go into the real-life house and pretend to be fish]
Patrick: Do we have to go to the Pen Palooza or not?
SpongeBob: We just need to find our way
