[the episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick driving to Glove World with SpongeBob as their boat]
SpongeBob: This sure looks like the vacation spirit is here.
Patrick: I feel so good.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I'm sure you'll agree.
Patrick: [laughs] Yeah, yeah, how could I not?
SpongeBob: Get off the road.
Patrick: [jumps off the road and trips on a stick] That's it! I'm taking a wrong turn at the pump. [drives out]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa! Whaa! [a truck blows a tire out]
SpongeBob: Nice, new round tire wrench.
Patrick: Nice. Robot hand.
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run to their favorite haunt. Patrick is on the phone]
Fisherman: Hey! Let's hook you up to a good night's sleep. Just $9.95/mo.
Patrick: And with mama?
Fisherman: Yeah. Yeah!
[SpongeBob and Patrick try to hook them up to the same nightshade as Gary]
SpongeBob: Don't be sad, Gary. We can borrow one of Gary's stinky pink nightssharks.
Patrick: That's me! [shows SpongeBob the nightshade] This is great. Thanks for lending me that nightshade.
SpongeBob: Patrick, that was the nightshade.
Patrick: Really?
SpongeBob: Well, what do you think?
Patrick: Well, itchy!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gets bandaged up]
Patrick: It's not the nightshade!
SpongeBob: It is?
Patrick: Yes, it is! [shows SpongeBob the bandaged up bandaged-up Patrick] Yes, it is.
SpongeBob: I don't know what nightshade it is, Patrick. I'm just glad that I invented Halloween!
Patrick: Yeah, yeah, Patrick, we should use this! [SpongeBob throws the sleeping Patrick in his sleep mask]
SpongeBob: Nightshade?
Patrick: Nightshade?!
SpongeBob: No, not until you find out what kind of a monster... [Patrick scares SpongeBob with his squeaky boots] is attacking... me!
Patrick: I'm a monster?!
SpongeBob: No, not at all. [screams] Mud! Mud! [mumbles] Alright, Snail heaven! Let's head back for breakfast. Hmm... That was delicious. [cries] Oh, Snail heaven! I knew I was gonna die!
Patrick: [comes out of his shell] Can't you see my misery? Looks like Gary's back. [Gary is sleeping] Eww! [cries]
SpongeBob: [laughs] He did what he was supposed to do today. He did what he was supposed to do today.
Patrick: That's great! I wish I had a pet snail! [SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward share a good laugh. A spider monkey's cry is heard. The spider monkey bites his lower his pants and falls asleep on the ground. SpongeBob's eyes rip off and he lands on Squidward's hand]
Squidward: What's wrong, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: My pants! [Squidward wakes up and looks in the mirror] SpongeBob! Uh, Squidward, I have a new pet snail. [whooping cough] I don't know about what you're thinking, but I've got a pet snail! [SpongeBob and Patrick snicker as they take Gary, who is now asleep, and eat him.]
Gary: Meow.
Patrick: [begins to wail] I don't wail a single word. [has a worried expression. Cut to morning where Squidward is watching the news with his eyes, and looking at the newspaper while in disbelief]
