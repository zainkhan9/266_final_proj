SpongeBob: [singing] ♪I think the world would be a better place if I could fly ♪ [SpongeBob begins to Fly] 
Squidward: That's it, SpongeBob. That's the Plan B. You need to figure out how to fly. I was wondering if you wanted to do the A-okie-do-huh-LE-do-kenshay-lee-kenshay-lee.
SpongeBob: I'd love to, Squidward, but I've got to fly. [flicks 'er I-stars and lands on his back] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, you landed back pretty hard, so it's not very easy. How hard can you get? [SpongeBob's eyes widen] 
SpongeBob: How do I get in here? [SpongeBob jumps in the library. All of the Bikini Bottomites look at SpongeBob] 
Ivy: SpongeBob? What is it?!
SpongeBob: Say, this is my friend, not your brother. [jumps into the air and laughs]
