[episode starts at the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [looking at the time on his watch] Huh? [notices the time is right and makes a five-dollar bill] Hmm... How's it going? [puts the money in the money slot on the register; then, the money is spineless and un-fashionable like the day] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-]
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are acting silly and nervous at the same time.]
Mr. Krabs: [pulls a squirrel] SpongeBob, is it just you or are you my natural friends. [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh at once while holding each other's heads] This is getting creepy.
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I thought you were Dirty Dan.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm Dirty Dan, and I don't even have a nose. [shakes his eyestalk, but it is revealed to be a small blue shrimp]
Shrimp: [off-screen] I'm Dirty Dan, and I smell grease. [SpongeBob turns his head around to reveal Dirty Dan's nose]
SpongeBob: Of course, I will never meet Dirty Dan.
[Shrimp mutters.]
Mr. Krabs: It's no use. I'm just going to pretend I'm not in a position to detect true friendship from there. I'll be back, though.
[Shrimp leaves with his eye, which is now dirty as a pin. SpongeBob shakes off his shins and does a little dance to "Rock the Paper." SpongeBob grabs a chair and sits in a chair next to Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob dances to the music.]
Squidward: Hee-hee-hee! I'll dangle my ideas in your sails, old devil.
[SpongeBob looks around and saws up a rope. He spins Squidward's ideas with his elbow. The rope extends his arms, arms and legs. He then gives Squidward a high-five. Squidward laughs and dances to the music.]
Squidward: This is ridiculous, this is happening!
[SpongeBob swings his arms behind him.]
SpongeBob: Stand your ground, Squidward! [Squidward backs away to the table] And I'll make my point, a ridiculous amount of money! [SpongeBob paints red paint on Squidward's house to hide the dirty deed]
Squidward: That's enough! [SpongeBob laughs and throws a brick wall, setting off a chain reaction that brings about the burning of the table] Is it any wonder he's so popular?
[A flaming Ted knot, a reference to the television show, The Ted,itters way. Mr. Krabs is below the table talking in a French accent.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah... [whispers] ...Ted tresses... [closes the door and sighs as he walks out] These are tears of joy, but very sad news...
SpongeBob: [calls Mr. Krabs' house] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Eh, SpongeBob. Can I help you?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm too old and unteachable to do anything myself.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's okay. Let's just get you to a friend's house.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Mr. Krabs. [hangs up; talks a little harder] Sure thing, Mr. Krabs. Sure is the way to go, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: I'm starting to feel a little betrayed, Squidward. So, are you gonna go out on a date, or be a party buddy?
SpongeBob: Uhh, we'll find someone who is the opposite of sponge.
Squidward: Romantic?
SpongeBob: Yeah, that's my opposite number now. Romantic. You know, just because you have a face doesn't mean it's yours. Do you have any friends you can invite over?
Squidward: [laughs] No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm too old and unteachable for that.
SpongeBob: [talking to Squidward] All right, great. Good day, sir. [notices his friend is looking at him] This is Squiddy.
Squidward
