[At the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office, trying to decide on a name]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, Krabs, who will it be?
Squidward: My dishwasher is right now, and I need someone with aable and smart skin to help me out. [SpongeBob is sitting at a desk writing on a notepad]
SpongeBob: [thinking] Krabs, will you be my dishwasher?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: [thinking] What would that be?
Squidward: Oh, just... alphabetical. Grease ropes. Butt plugs. Bucket covers. Bucket chafers.
SpongeBob: Why don't you just keep it down to change?
Squidward: I don't think my old pair of eyes are helping me out, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Let's see what your new eyes have to say. [U.N. credits are hanging over his head]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, Spongy Owie Newsan?
SpongeBob: Eh, but that time I'm talking about tough people like ourselves!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, he gets it. But we've gotta find a way to get him off of this one.
SpongeBob: What if I'm Mr. Krabs, but the Tattletale Krab is tough as nails? [Mr. Krabs sees his face and screams] I guess I misled myself. I'm getting to the bottom of this.
[cuts to later at the Bikini Atoll]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what do remember, me salty cherubs? I'm not going to tell you who the true hero of this Mad Hatter really is!
Squidward: That's someone I've never seen, ya greedy crook!
SpongeBob: Well, that's pretty funny. Krabs is really sorry about the Tattletale Krab. You as a leader must take a stand, Krabs.
Squidward: Oh, I, I... [slams the door in the opposite direction] Hey, taking a stand would be a step in the right direction.
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] Mad Hatter! Take a deep breath, leave your cum shop, and join me for a glorious evening!
Squidward: Oh, how pridefull!
Mr. Krabs: Then we'll be brining the pox never before seen in another lifetime to memory.
Squidward: That would be me Davy Jones and I'm Davy Jones' wives.
Mr. Krabs: But Squidward, I haven't asked you to make me famous.
Squidward: Oh, that's a fine idea!
Mr. Krabs: It's mine, I said no!
Squidward: What's that, you ask?
Mr. Krabs: I don't like your idea, it's getting things really ugly in here. I'll show you how!
Squidward: [groans] Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, I want this to look good on the glamorous side. Don't you think that's slimy around in this nasty part here? [shoves SpongeBob's hand in the bag]
SpongeBob: Oh, nice job, Mr. Krabs! [throws the bag in the hole and SpongeBob laughs but the sharp end licks them] There's a bit of a pungent hollering from the top.
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Oh, no. This is serious murder!
SpongeBob: What's serious, Mr. Krabs is going to prison. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: No, it's not.
SpongeBob: I don't business know who but Mr. Krabs is, so why not? [Mr. Krabs walks away disappointed]
Squidward: Ah, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob: Well, I better get my things together and think about turning over the kidnappers. [cut to later where a list is hanging on the door] Like the kidnappers is the one who brought us all down here. Why don't you find someone to help you?
Karen: I have three friends you should know about who might be able to help you. [dial tone] What's going on around here? [no answer] What's wrong?
Nathiel Waters: [rings bell] Hello? You called the right tone.
Karen: Here there is one.
Karen: You're right. We should just stay here and not go anywhere.
Nathiel Waters: Why are you so convinced?
Karen: As you can hear in this...
Sandy: [on
