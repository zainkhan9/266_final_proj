[Episode starts when SpongeBob and Patrick are running through Jellyfish Fields wearing gas masks. SpongeBob uses his gas mask to blow a bubble in there and Patrick uses his eyes to throw rocks in there. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh and SpongeBob turns into a jellyfish.]
SpongeBob: [as he is jumping] How could I have missed this opportunity to capture the sweet taste of stony sea life? [crushed from the sting of Patrick's stolen jellyfish bloom] I lost me eyes! [sobbing]
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run off. Meanwhile, the kids are still wandering around, mouthing the old man says nonsense.]
Old Man Jenkins: [walks out of his house] What's with the mask? And what's with the goggles?
Kids: Uh-oh. My eyes are too small. I was too young to notice. [gasps as he sees an elderly fish] I'm your mother! Uh, I saw it! I saw it! I saw it! I'm right here! I'm right here! Mother!
SpongeBob: It's working!
Patrick: Yeah! [shouts into the megaphone] I'm back, I'm right here! [everyone runs to SpongeBob and hits him] I'm back, I'm right here!
Gus: [has one more rock thrown on him than he needed] Get him off of me! I'm gravity!
SpongeBob: Oh, you're so hard-shelled.
Gus: Huh? [jumps off] Oh no! He's... gone! [Gus jumps into SpongeBob's mouth, sucks him in his pants, and falls off him]
SpongeBob: I win, I win! [SpongeBob stands in front of a rock] I'm right here! I'm right here!
Patrick: [shows SpongeBob the rock] Uh-oh... SpongeBob, you dropped it.
SpongeBob: SpongeBob, jeez, it was a rock that you dropped.
Patrick: Tell me more!
SpongeBob: More... Oh, yeah. [takes a deep breath] I found it. [takes a deep breath again]
Patrick: Well, it's got a little POI. [jumps up off the rock]
SpongeBob: Oh! Oh! Oh, Patrick!
[Patrick's skeleton falls out.]
Patrick: Oh! [looks in SpongeBob's direction] Oh, hey there, SpongeBob-man. What do you think of my shovelive?
SpongeBob: [looks at shovel and cries] I'm a little sorry, [picks up Patrick] just getting rid of your old infernal effigy.
Patrick: Yeah, you're not the only one who needs an I.
SpongeBob: Oh... that other one... [cut to SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob is having fun digging]
Fish: Welcome to SpongeBob's house! I am here to meet my buddy, SpongeBob the Pirate.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy.
Billy: Are you ready for today?
SpongeBob: Oh, what do I look like now, huh?
Billy: [humming] Uhh... granny patch!
[Harold sighs. The fish walks off. The scene changes to show the exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple. He is sleeping then wakes up and looks outside. The light bulb breaks]
SpongeBob: Hmm, I know what to do.
[SpongeBob looks in the mirror then walks into his room. Face paint comes out of his head like a paint brush. SpongeBob opens the shower curtain and absorbs the paint. Then he goes outside to wash his teeth, sitting on his couch, and eats his cocoa]
SpongeBob: I am prepared.
French Narrator: 3 hours later. Just then...
[Patrick walks by and screams]
4-D Tentacles: [screams] It's ready!
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing!?
Patrick: I brought a spare drum.
SpongeBob: You forgot one, buddy!
Patrick: Okay, see you later! [takes drum out of Patrick's house and throws it on the ground]
SpongeBob: That was extra heavy, Patrick. Now I'm going to need you to... [rolls his eyes, puts it in his mouth, and breaks it off again] I didn't mean to break your peace, but... put another way, why doesn't anybody think about... [gets hit by the drum again] Barnacles! Oh, barnacle, why can't I talk!?
Patrick: Why can't I have a good time, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Patrick?
