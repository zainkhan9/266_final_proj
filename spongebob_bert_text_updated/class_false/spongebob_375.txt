[Scene opens up to the Krusty Krab where a delivery robot is waiting for you]
Delivery robot: So, what do you say, delivery boy?
[Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: I like you. [Delivery robot takes you through the door]
Delivery robot: On the phone?
Mr. Krabs: Store credit, please.
[SpongeBob is waiting for you]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. [Goes over to Mr. Krabs, but you can hear a little boom in the background] It's the boom! Mr. Krabs, he failed his boating test! [The scene returns to the dump where you can see Mr. Krabs still driving the dump marked "PROMOTED" on SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs has a long, barrel-shaped license plate on him] So, what's your name?
Mr. Krabs: [cheering] Phoebe!
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Phoebe?
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen] Phoebe!
SpongeBob: [offscreen] SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs: [waving in the air] I'm Mr. Krabs! So, if anyone can write a real name, it this instant! [Plankton appears and tries to steal the address book from SpongeBob]
Plankton: Help, please! She's trying to steal my address book! I'll pay them rent, she'll pay the customers! She'll steal my picture! [Suddenly, SpongeBob hears the word "no" in the code book and screams. Cut to Krusty Krab where SpongeBob enters the restaurant and tries to get the formula. When he walks into the kitchen, he gets run over by the boating coach, who is ruining everyone's time by breaking them up.]
Miss Shell: What happened to you?
SpongeBob: I've had enough of your nonsense! [Miss Shell removes the bottle with the formula from her grasp and places it in the bottle] I'm Mr. Krabs, king of the free-for-all! No more bottle commitments, sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Stops dancing behind a rock] Wait, pardon me, but you haven't been a king?!
Miss Shell: No buts! Now you're!
SpongeBob: [Thinking] Hey, Mr. Krabs, let me get this straight. I'm Mr. Krabs, king of the triangle! How about you as king of the free-for-all?! [Thinking] You're Mr. Krabs, my man? For me?
Mr. Krabs: [Thinking] Yeah! And you're Mr. Krabs, my man?
SpongeBob: Oh, you are.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah? So what do ya think?
SpongeBob: I think I'm gonna be a king!
Mr. Krabs: [getting dressed] All right, honey. Let's get out of here before you have to be a king.
SpongeBob: What, no questions.
Mr. Krabs: What? No! [SpongeBob gets dressed] I'm Mr. Krabs, king of the square. All right, spring must be on the horizon, Krabs! Come and join me, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes down the path]
SpongeBob: [screams] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Come here or the garden is for me. [SpongeBob dips his head into the fryer] What is the meaning of this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: This is a pretty good bet.
Mr. Krabs: Behold, the King of Clarinets!
SpongeBob: Who is that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: It's me, Mr. Krabs. He's the man for the job, I can tell you.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's great, Mr. Krabs. Why don't you take the reins of majesty, and become the king of the squares? Oh, just what do you want, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: What? Uh, just... just go home. [SpongeBob Pushes SpongeBob] Okay, just what do you want, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: The king of the squares.
SpongeBob: Uh, just the square or the giant?
Mr. Krabs: The giant. [SpongeBob Pushes SpongeBob to the King of the Square Wall] Now, slip up, SpongeBob! You're the king of the squares, I'm the king of the squares! [
