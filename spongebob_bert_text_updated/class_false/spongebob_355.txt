[episode starts with Gary watching TV]
Johnny: Specializing in television. [shows off his new TV]
Nancy: Hi, guys.
Johnny: And this is [shows his TV] [shows some ads on TV] [shows and laughs] one of those specialities. Not exactly what I had in mind when I showed up at the Krusty Krab.
Karen: You're not gonna find a better way to express yourself than with words. Let's hear what you have to say.
[announces a special delivery point]
SpongeBob: Karen, this is the man. [Karen gives him a delivery bag] Dan over at the Krusty Krab. [Holds up a newspaper with the delivery]
Karen: [says delivery for [ITS] [IT AGAIN] [IT AGAIN IN IT'] beautiful words!
SpongeBob: [COMMENTS] Beautiful words!
Karen: Congratulations. You don't have any more.
[Karen opens the delivery bag and reveals the delivery bag with the delivery inside]
SpongeBob: [COMMENTS] Beautiful words!
Karen: Hmmm. [Karen closes the bag] You didn't even get to read what I wrote.
SpongeBob: Dahahahaha! What am I saying? I have to write a poem now.
Karen: [sneers and writes in a snooty voice] Okay, what do you expect to write?
SpongeBob: [writes on a notepad] The big booger poem.
Karen: Oh, well, that was so thoughtful of you. Yeah. [Laughs] I guess [Kicks the bag] poetry is for the oral experience.
SpongeBob: [gulps] I never thought I'd say this, but... [writes on a notepad] I like to use this. [Slaps his face into the notepad] This will be easier to spell.
Karen: [writes on another notepad] Okay, hold. [Takes out his phone and dials the number]
SpongeBob: Hello, spp. [Answers the phone] Hello, spp. [Answers the phone again] Sir, it's-it's SpongeBob's fault. SpongeBob... he... heff... he's just been here for nothing? And how did that poem get put on this thing?
Karen: It was [Kicks the notepad] when [ARRGH!] [SpongeBob IS AWAY! Laughter is heard]...that wild beast that wanted to destroy the old navy. Stupid fish, he couldn't have done it had it not been for [Kicks the notepad again] [Gasps] The Nautical Theft of Miss Puff! [Whimpering] Man on the Run! [She walks away] I'm sorry, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I couldn't write these stories for your generation. But, you can certainly grow your own hair. [Takes out two hair buns] Here, let me see your wig. [Hands Mermaid Man two hair buns]
Mermaid Man: one, two, three, four!
Mermaid Man: you can certainly grow your own hair! It's only natural!
Barnacle Boy: Hey, we take any concerns about hair care seriously!
Mermaid Man: Well, anything you want, sir.
SpongeBob: [Walks in the door and gets turned on] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, we hope and breathe life back!
Mermaid Man: I guess we'll see each other when we have clean hair. And buns! [Puts two hair buns on the window. Barnacle Boy gasps] My hair!
SpongeBob: Wigs. Wigs. Wigs. Wigs.
Mermaid Man: Wait, you've seen my wig, have you? [Wigs dangle on the window. Millie gets mad]
Barnacle Boy: What? No! [Wigs wiggle around on the window]
Mermaid Man: Look at them! They're burning!
SpongeBob: No! I've got to call the hospital! [Walks in the door]
Karen: Why you no answer! It's Sunday!
Mermaid Man: [Angrily] No, you haven't. It's Sunday. [Wigs fall on the window. SpongeBob dials the number and the phone rings. Mermaid Man, who's wearing a wig, tries to ignore the phone, only to realize that he's wearing a phone hat] Huh? What's that? [Mermaid Man picks up SpongeBob] No, no, no, no, no, no, Mermaid Man!
