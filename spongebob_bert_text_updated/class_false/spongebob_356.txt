[Episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward are humming to themselves as they walk into the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Huh? [salutes] Sun wish! Ah ah! Home sweet home! [sighs] I knew I must work my posterior to remove Neptune's hair. [walks inside the pineapple] It's not that funny. [right foot is in the middle of the floor, but when he pushes it, it falls out. He laughs] That's why I love you, uhh, SpongeBob. You're every bit as annoying as that Neptune employee. [He giggles and pulls a picture of Squidward down, but Squidward pulls it back] Every time I see you, Mr. Squidward, I'll order you to get out of here. You have my back. [walks over to SpongeBob] SpongeBob, what do you want?
Squidward: [growls] SpongeBob, don't I have to do something?
SpongeBob: I have nothing to do... [screams and runs back into his house]
Squidward: Now you're getting it. [SpongeBob opens the door. Squidward and SpongeBob both scream and run back into their house. Later, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are in Cabin Two.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what happened? Why are we sitting here? [SpongeBob notices Squidward up the stairs] Squidward: I knocked on his door... and I got no answer. I don't have a answer! What am I gonna do?
Squidward: Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna work at the Krusty Krab anymore. [Mr. Krabs pats Squidward] It's just a little contract.
SpongeBob: Oh, what contract?
Squidward: It's what. Krusty Krab. [SpongeBob notices Patrick about to knock on the door]
Patrick: I don't understand.
SpongeBob: What do you want?
Patrick: I don't know.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: I don't have a answer! What am I gonna do?! [They both start crying]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs cries some more]
Squidward: [He has a drinking glass and a drinking straw. He then walks to the Krusty Krab. The crowd is still chanting]
Mr. Krabs: [Later] Thanks for the picky employee. [Everyone cheers]
Sandy: We already got one. Here, come the pickles.
Patrick: I already had one. [Patrick picksles a blue crusty bun]
SpongeBob: [Excitedly] What's that, Patrick?
Patrick: It's a pickle. [Picks up the crusty bun]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick. You're so good.
Patrick: I am.
Squidward: [Walking to the crowd] Patty, extra super. [Walks to the crowd and sets the pickle on fire. The crowd cheers. Squidward gets angry. Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Plankton get on SpongeBob and throw tomatoes at him]
Sandy: Argh, extra stuu... [Plankton gets on SpongeBob and makes him punch him]
Mr. Krabs: Ugh, those two are so hard to get to the post office.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, we have to go the street.
Mrs. Puff: No problem, SpongeBob.
[On the road he sees a house with a flag on it. He walks up to it, and falls down. The crowd then becomes very upset, and start to stomping and get away from the post office sign. Mr. Krabs comes out of the house, and sees SpongeBob and Patrick approaching the Krusty Krab after they started the ride.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, rub it in.
SpongeBob: Let's go, Patrick.
Patrick: It's too bad they ran out of toilet paper. [SpongeBob pumps water in a bucket and Patrick sits on the front porch, while Mr. Krabs continues to suffer through his exhaustingpacking the Krusty Krab. As he begins to get tired, he puts his water helmet on, and Patrick sits on a stool, while SpongeBob continues to suffer through the ride even with him being so far away.]
Mr. Krabs: [tears up his arms] Well, we got a long way to go before we have access to fresh batteries, new televisions, and even... [holds up his dollar] new jets to fly! [SpongeBob looks at his watch]
