[Episode begins at Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick are singing in the bathroom while playing in with vibrating bubbles]
SpongeBob and Patrick: ♪La la la la la la la la♪
[Patrick pops the bubbles, rips off his shirt and throws it into the bathroom. SpongeBob comes in, dressed in a bathrobe]
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. Do you like bath time?
Patrick: No. I only do it for the bath.
SpongeBob: Wha-ha, buddy?
Patrick: Yeah. What do you like better, Squidward? The bubbles or the glass containers?
SpongeBob: The glass containers?
Patrick: Yeah, yeah, the glass containers.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are having a laugh in the bathtub]
SpongeBob: Wha-ha, what a glass container?
Patrick: Yeah, I like the glass better.
[Cuts to the inside of the bathroom]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary. Let's see inside. [takes out a glass container]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [opens up a container and peaks through the holes] Good stuff, Good thing we have a scratch-free Gary. [tries to open it, but is unsuccessful] Uh, oh!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't close the window. Open up! Huh, I can't see my inside. [tries to pull the glass container open, but it rips open the glass and reveals his brain] Ah, Gary! Your brain is inside me!
[SpongeBob tries to push the glass container closed, but it pops and squirts air into his head]
Patrick: [sits on his chair and prepares to brush the sink] SpongeBob, what do you think about this glass of water? [tries to push it but it rips off and squirts air into his ears]
SpongeBob: I've never seen so many words for foghorn, Gary.
Patrick: [his eyes get jet-fire] Oh! Well, of course.
SpongeBob: Oh, what do you think? [tries to push the glass off, but it pops and squirts water]
Patrick: Oh, oh!
SpongeBob: What do you think? [tries to push the glass off, but it rips off and squirts food into his eyes]
Patrick: Oh, you have eyes?!
SpongeBob: Uh, what do I have this glass of water for?
[SpongeBob has on a visu-cortex like headband that looks like Squidward's head. He is shown using his eyes, and visu-cortex like body. Now, we will see about language, Gary. We cut to Patrick's house, and we see that Patrick has just finished taking out his garbage]
Patrick: I'm going back to my art. I must draw better pictures. [a garbage truck drives up, and a bunch of trash come out]
Harold: I don't see any trash here.
Patrick: Artist, art dealer. Hey, what's this? No one's ever told me this would be something nice. Why don't you draw me a Mermaid Man-Or-Red Tide? [draws this boatmobile. The garbage truck jumps and gets near the top, but crashes right through it. Now, when we get to the top, Patrick is wearing the curlers] Hey, what's this? No one's ever told me this would be nice. No one's ever told me this picture of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me... [Patrick comes out of the picture-window. Now, we are at the Mermaid Man sign, which says "Out of Business."]
Patrick: Quit your puny callipers and draw me a Mermaid Man-Or-Red Tide. [it has now run out of ink. Now, we will need to draw a picture. But this is only the beginning. Patrick will shout in Mermaid Man accent "I'm ready to claw your stupid hand"!] It's too late. [the garbage truck runs out. Now, we will need to find a place for the sculpture] Draw me a drawing. [he takes the pencil and the boat whip. Now, we will use the pencil to write on the sculpture and draw some designs. But then, some of the drawings would be a match for the garbage truck. So, draw me a match. [the trash truck runs into the sculpture] Draw me a match. [the truck runs out of ink. Now, we will need to find a place for the sculpture] Draw me a match. [the trash truck is about to drive off. We see
