Squidward: Two alone Spongebob?
SpongeBob: [laughs] We're not alone, Squidward. That song will never go out. Call me. Pen Pal. [Squidward stutters] Huh? Wha...? [SpongeBob stutters again] Two alone. This is our special night. Don't want to ruin it. [horn honks] Oh, no. [stutters, then stops because SpongeBob knocks on his window]

Squidward: [screams] My leg!
SpongeBob: Good grief. Couldn't we just go home and play?
Squidward: No! My leg! You men! Have you lost your manhood?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, I have lost my manhood!

Squidward: [wakes up] Oh. Now, what happened to my manhood?
