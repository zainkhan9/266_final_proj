<Start Ep> 
[Episode begins with Gary watching TV in his upstairs window. He sticks out his cell phone and dials the house. Inside, Gary is scratching and cuddling against his TV.]
Gary: [yawns]
[Gary continues to murmur and hop around. As he mumbles, his eyes become tubes. His eyes become tubes and he opens his eye lens. A wide-angle shot of SpongeBob's face shows a realistic Gary]
SpongeBob: Gary? You in here? Come on, little buddy, let's go let's get some hot and chunky. You're a bit too pretty for this town, here. [grabs Gary] Where's my lemonade, SpongeBob? I'll just walk you home now. You'll live with your parents in peace. [grunts as he runs to the front door] Where's my ride, SpongeBob?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I think I know what's going on here. Remember when Gary was a baby. One in which babies were shown to have babies, and they didn't talk anymore? Well, I think it's time for him to go. He was an infant, not a toddler. A beautiful picture for the little guy. [Gary turns around; creepily] Huh? [lays Gary on the ground] I thought you were gonna cry. [picks him up] I know you're not. You've got a lot on your mind. [lifts his arm and walks away]
Gary: [sighs] Huh? [lays Gary on the ground]
SpongeBob: [meetsamorphoses into a baby] Well, I guess this is it. My youth had me turning to stone. [turns his head into an oval shape] My youth had me turning to stone. [turns his head again into an oval shape] [lays on the ground] Well, that's all well and good, but my time here is up. My time here is up. [meanwhile, Gary is sleeping]
SpongeBob: Gary, wake up. [touches Gary's bed and sees Gary's alarm clock turn off] Ah, Gary, my alarm clock's killing me. [Gary wakes up] Gary? [Gary is in SpongeBob's arms] Gary? [SpongeBob touches Gary's arm, destroying it] Gary? [SpongeBob touches Gary's eye, destroying it] Gary? [SpongeBob touches Gary's leg, destroying it] Gary? [SpongeBob touches Gary's head, destroying it] Gary? [SpongeBob touches Gary's eyes, knocking it over and over. Now Gary is unconscious] Gary? [SpongeBob touches Gary's teeth, causing it to say "TEEN" instead. Gary puts on the pacemaker, and wakes up] Gary? [picks Gary] Gary? [SpongeBob touches him, causing him to say "TEEN"] Hey, I'm two years older, older Gary! [SpongeBob touches Gary even more] Ow! [SpongeBob touches Gary's tail] Hey, Gary! [SpongeBob touches Gary's shell, causing it to say "TEEN"] Hey, Gary! [SpongeBob touches Gary's shell, causing him to say "TEEN"] Hey, Gary! [SpongeBob touches Gary's tail] Hey, Gary! [SpongeBob touches Gary's eyestalks] Come on, Gary! Look! [SpongeBob touches Gary's eye and it starts to say "IT'S A BOY'S WED!"] Huh? [SpongeBob touches Gary and it starts to say "IT'S A BOY'S WED!!] What's wrong, Gary?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, they're not having such a wonderful day. [Squidward opens door] Here you go, friend. [walks to the picnic table] Watch this. [touches table then walks back to SpongeBob] Watch yourself. [touches table] This isn't good.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm just here to rub my new baby tooth. [Rubs the table again then throws his baby tooth away, which he gets back]

SpongeBob: Just let me have it. [walks to and pulls string that says "Jellyfish" out of the string, then whispers to SpongeBob] Oh, wait, I thought it was a joke. Oh, it's a boy's toy. [SpongeBob rubs the "Jellyfish" on his face, then talks to it] Now, you're a boy's toy. What do you say we play around a bit with that 'cause you've got a baby tooth.
Nat: Yeah, looks like a
