[At the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is trying to decide about the best time to open his own restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob! Why don't you just come down here and try something already? And...happen! Tell me, why don't you just come down here and try something? 
SpongeBob: Great idea, Mr. Krabs! 
[SpongeBob walks into the kitchen of the restaurant and sees Squidward serving Krabby Patties to a group of tourists.]
SpongeBob: Ah, it's a nice day for a Krabby Patty. I'll take a bite. Aw, I'm not hungry. Hmm...[sees a dime fall off] Oh! This is terrible! I'm going to order a Krabby Patty and get it all back together...before I go in the kitchen...
Squidward: But you left your keys down in a box, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Squidward, I—[gets pushed against the wall by Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: What? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: My keys!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, did I leave you? [steps on SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, is that you?
Mr. Krabs: Yes. I—[tries to cover himself with a box]
SpongeBob: Come here, Mr. Krabs. 
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, something's wrong with Squidward. He—
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was just trying to serve you something that was good and delicious.
Mr. Krabs: What's that?
SpongeBob: I tried to tell you earlier that I was working for the good old Krusty Krab, and I just didn't get a bill! [starts taking money]
Mr. Krabs: [puts money away in his pocket] Well, if it's good enough, it's good enough for you. It's that simple! I'll charge you for your use of that wallet I call 'The Krusty Krab'.
SpongeBob: Welcome, ma'am, to the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: Wonderful— [gasps as he sees the money] Why, welcome to the Krusty Krab! Why, welcome to the Krusty Sponge— [sticks the money in the fryer and gets a hard time] Why, welcome to the Krusty Ghost!
[The customers are disgusted by the entertaining display and are willing to pay a penny for anything at the Krusty Sponge stand.]
Harold: It's the worst display I've ever seen! [customers gasp] No, wait, they're here first!
Fred: I've seen worse!
[The customers protest loudly and in so much anger.]
Nat: We want paychecks!
Marv: We want money for every customer!
SpongeBob: Just send him a couple of hundred dollars, and we'll give you the rest you deserve!
Jimmy: Here's the deal! [gets an even bigger stack of money and starts crying] I can't go to work today, because Mr. Krabs is taking me out.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No! Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! I'll take care of that again! No, wait!
[Mr. Krabs reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tiny wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, me darling boy! This is the one! The one where I can buy me lunch! Look on the bright side, SpongeBob! I'm free!
SpongeBob: Wow, quite a wealth!
Mr. Krabs: Whoo, a wallet full of money!
SpongeBob: So, what's it for?
Mr. Krabs: For lunch!
SpongeBob: For Plankton?
Mr. Krabs: He's the champion of the park service—talk about a champion! [SpongeBob gasps] The champion of the park system, that is! I'm sorry, but you're being too hard on the little guy. You're pushing too hard a margin. I want you to tell me for sure.
SpongeBob: Oh, I don't want to tell you, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob looks at some music going on] Oh, what are you doing? Come on, let's listen to the radio. [Radio turns on. SpongeBob hears some obnoxious music from upstairs] Mmm... whale! [Starts to walk downstairs but a murmur of weirdness comes from
