[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is singing.]
SpongeBob: ♪I've got a hot sauce like no other. I like Krabby Patties, I like beans, I like beans.♪ [Wonders where to put the Krabby Patty.] ♪I like to call it a patty because it's so full of goodness. ♪[Ding, dings, dings] Cucumbers. ♪Krabby Kuget. ♪I like cucumbers.♪ [Notices Patrick] ♪I think this is it. My life story. I was in that submarine that had that cucumber on it.♪ [Digs into the kitchen and finds the cucumber sitting on a overhead table. As SpongeBob walks in, a Krabby Patty droops out and SpongeBob pops his head out of the cucumber. Squidward walks in.]
Squidward: Hello.
[The patty lands on the table and sinks in. Mr. Krabs is in his office playing his game, while drooling.]
Mr. Krabs: That's enough! Your survey should tell you who you're voting for. Oh, I'm going to put Squidward in charge of the Krusty Krab. He looks pretty incompetent.
[Squidward runs up to Mr. Krabs.]
Squidward: Okay! Okay! [He winks his name]
Mr. Krabs: That guy's a real brain. He knows all about putting a man in charge of the bees.
[The patty lands on the table.]
Squidward: Who's there?
[The patty goes flying into the empty Krusty Krab lander. The bee putster bounces on his head, while Mr. Krabs stands there, mumbling.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I've got to vote for the little yellow guy!
[The B.O. stands there, with party hats on]
Mr. Krabs: You can't make us members, SpongeBob. We're a tiny, half-organized,, smelly, bunch of cheapskate swine. And we're gonna break every law in Bikini Bottom. [Gives SpongeBob his hat.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Mr. Krabs. That makes me sick.
Mr. Krabs: Ah! Yes, SpongeBob!
[The B.O. stands there, drinking a soda.]
Mr. Krabs: If you want the membership card, you'll have to go to the Krusty Krab. [Holds card in his mouth] There's plenty of room in here.
SpongeBob: But I don't want to.
Mr. Krabs: You're asking about my... [Mr. Krabs takes out a mini KK and shows an employee how it works]
SpongeBob: Why? Uh, you want to know?
Mr. Krabs: Why? I want to learn more about the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Well, see you later, Mr. Krabs. [Back to Mr. Krabs' desk] Still need some tips for making fast service patties?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, forget this.
Squidward: I need some old cooking knowledge.
SpongeBob: Shady Shoals is closed. I need a little personal space here.
[The scene changes to show the exterior of a house. Squidward is shown at home doing her reading a book. She also eats some bread. She also eats some glitter. At the kitchen table, there is a huge amount of glue going on the walls. Mr. Krabs is shown with his jaw in fear. He looks at the mess the place is in. He quickly moves out of the living room and down the hall. He gets himself twisted. He is also wearing a ankle brace. Squidward is shown with a stack of newspapers over his head.]
Squidward: [Frightened] I am going to Heaven! Get away from that stupid desk!!
[He kicks the table, causing it to topple over. The table goes down the drain and falls into the garbage. Squidward looks angry. He turns on the Krusty Krab sign.]
Mr. Krabs: It's for sale! Bent Squidward! [The scene changes to show the front of the Krusty Krab. Squidward walks in.] Bent Squidward! [He kicks the table] Bent Squidward! [The two are inside and out of the front of the restaurant. They laugh.] That's funny. I thought it was illegal.
[They get out of the restaurant through the back door. The scene changes to show the back door. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are laughing. Mr.
