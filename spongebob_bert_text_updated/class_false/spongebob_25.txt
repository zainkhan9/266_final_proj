[episode starts with Squidward walking to his house. In the kitchen, Patrick is using a Krabby Patty he made with raw almonds. He separates the meat and the tomatoes into chunks and puts his fingers together making a "Krabby Patty." He then eats these chunks and puts his fingers back together making a "Krabby Ice." He then finishes up with the whole thing.]
Squidward: [is eating krabby ice-cold pizza] One bite of that, eh? I'm got some special cheese. [laughs]
[Patrick is taking a bunch of buns and chopping them up. He then eats the entire thing and leaves.]
Mrs. Puff: [screams] Not the house! Not the Krusty Krab! Not the world!
[Patrick then comes out and shows up in a brown t-shirt and jeans. He is carrying a mop in a cool red shade. He is also eating a bunch of stuff and then squirts it all over the place.]
SpongeBob: [hat tip to SpongePatrick] Krusty Krab, baby.
Squidward: [plaintively] Oh, no! Not again! I... I...
[cut to Mrs. Puff putting her nails in pots and pans.]
Mrs. Puff: Hmm? [looks at her nails] Bun on top order. Prepared.
Squidward: Bun on top? I can't afford that!
[SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen with a bucket of hot water and a can of ketchup.]
SpongeBob: Hold on. We're all done.
[Squidward frantically goes to put the bucket on the table. However, he pulls the bucket up to nothing. It is as if the water has stopped being warm and is bubbling inside the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: Huh?
[Mrs. Puff gets really angry at Squidward and leaves. The scene changes to all of a sudden Mr. Krabs comes out of his office.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, Squidward, those are no hot peppers to make now, but when the grill's no use, it's no wonder Squidward's getting his hair dirty. [shows filth on the grill]
Squidward: Funny you should mention that, you know.
Mr. Krabs: Make a movie, Squidward. [laughs]
[Cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is flinging workers and equipment at the workers. SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen with a tan residue on his body.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, tan residue?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, tan residue?
SpongeBob: [teary eyed] That's what I said! [shows a tanning bed] This isn't working!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] This isn't working?!?!
SpongeBob: It's okay, Mr. Krabs, this isn't crashing!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's not crashing! It's crashing! It's crashing!
SpongeBob: Oh, I've got pieces all over my body!
Mr. Krabs: Bleh!
[Cut to a tanning bed with tan residue on it.]
SpongeBob: Whoa, look at this!
[SpongeBob jumps on the tan bed bed and crushes the residue with his claws. After covering the residue with a covering powder, it turns SpongeBob tanning bed time. SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen with a tray of three dishes with tan residue on them. He goes to the tanning machine and does some batch after batch on the dishes.]
SpongeBob: Done! So wha-what's this?
Mr. Krabs: It's a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Got your number, Mr. Krabs.
[Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob and stuffs him in the machine.]
Mr. Krabs: I'll be right back, SpongeBob.
[Mr. Krabs returns with the secret formula and gives it to SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I did it, Mr. Krabs! It's been my favorite...
Mr. Krabs: What? What's so great about a Krabby Patty anyway?
SpongeBob: I'm so glad you're famous!
Mr. Krabs: That's me money!
SpongeBob: Whoo-wee, come on in. [everyone gets in line]
Squidward: What is it?
Mr. Krabs: I'd like to talk to your money. [takes SpongeBob's money and stuffs it into SpongeBob's mouth]
SpongeBob: Here you
