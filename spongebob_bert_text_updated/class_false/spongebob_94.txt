[The scene transitions to the Krusty Krab where Squidward is re-watching The Lifeguard's Club Go.]
Squidward: [as the customers walk up] I can't believe it's 7:00. Why is it so hard to leave early?
Dry Dock Head: Because it's... [turns go]
Squidward: Hmm. Well, I've been working all night to make it last.
Dennis: All right, that's 6â€”good. But why does it have to be so hard?
Dennis: Because then it'll be late night working.
Dennis: [laughs] It's not just about the money.
SpongeBob: [hanging onto Mr. Krabs, or losing his patience with the shift] It's about the way we work.
Mr. Krabs: [turns away, annoyed] Oh, uh, I lost him. I won't be needing these after I go to work. [closes the door and goes over to SpongeBob, who is working as a fork in the machine]
SpongeBob: Please tell me more obvious things are possible.
Mr. Krabs: I can work this out. [takes out a square in two.] Almost. [takes out a board in the same manner.] Almost certainly.
SpongeBob: Almost certainly.
Mr. Krabs: And you want me to fix his house in time? How about you repair his house in time? 
SpongeBob: How do we do that?
Mr. Krabs: We need as much free time as we have money!
Squidward: Well, that's not even a job. A job. 
SpongeBob: Okay, okay. [turns to a picture] How about you paint his house?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Here's the plan... [thinks for a minute] let's say... [looks up and sees a fence] Huh? I wonder what's in that. [gasps] It's not his house. [thinks again] in case there is any cleaning after this drubbing. 
SpongeBob: Ooh! Oh! So cleaning's not as easy as it sounds. [flips a switch and makes a chain reaction, turning the paint in the chain into chain, then makes a new paint can into a chain, then makes a red light appear in the chain, making cleaning and a squeaky trail of squeaky paint appears] 
Mr. Krabs: I'm sorry, little girl. This is all your fault! [laughs] 
SpongeBob: I know, Mr. Krabs! Make me home with ya. I've been meaning to do this, but I've always preferred staying in my bedroom! [the scene cuts to Squidward in his bed, whimpering] 
Squidward: Is this what we've really come to, SpongeBob? You've always preferred staying in your bedroom! And you can prove it when you play with Larry's newest toy. Larry's recently redesigned, his Icky Kitchen Oven. [sticks an Icky Kitchen Oven onto Squidward's Icky Kitchen lamp] Now, it's almost as if the... [Icky Kitchen Oven burns real fast] ...kitchen sink! [SpongeBob burns forever] Now, you can blow your Icky kitchen with your little fez. You know how they [runs into his Kitchen Oven] Hydrate you with pride! Whooaaa... [does a little Latin dance] 
SpongeBob: This even works! My Icky Kitchen Oven could do with some hydration, even a little jolly neighbor. [drinks some herbal tea] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, I have to ask you something.
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really.
SpongeBob: Good.
Squidward: I really don't know what I want with this. [rips his bed and SpongeBob hops out of bed] I think this one'll go with it. [SpongeBob sniffs it, but it burns his straw] 
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward. But your straw drinking is so awesome! 
Squidward: That's me! Why I'd want to scrap my bed and get back to work!
SpongeBob: But you shouldn't have been there!
Squidward: Time to get back to work!
SpongeBob: [shouts into the night] Hooray! [sees a monster lurking around Patrick's house] Hide these evil plans so your neighbor can't see! 
Patrick: Ohh... 
Squidward: Ohh... [the monster growls before roaring again] 
Patrick:
