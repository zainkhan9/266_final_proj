[Episode starts with Squidward walking home. He places his keys on the table, as he accidentally knocks them down. Robin Williams is heard laughing.]
Fred: Oh, why'd he do it, Robin?
Squidward: Oh, he's such a good friend, nothing make him a star. I'll never be a star.
[Squidward touches his keys, causing his body to quake and a score of people are gathered around Mr. Krabs to yell at him.]
Mr. Krabs: I'll rule him, SpongeBob!
[A total idiot, greedy, big-eyed monster steals the sacred title from Squidward and runs off. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs hide below him.]
SpongeBob: Um, Mr. Krabs, hello?
Mr. Krabs: [sees the monster] Huh? Monster... [the monster shatters the sacred title and SpongeBob screams] Huh? [walks towards the door which the other fish are locking]
SpongeBob: Wait ‘�me, Mr. Krabs! We might get a sneak peak of... [Mr. Krabs tears the title off the monster. SpongeBob screams again] Splendid! [Mr. Krabs tears the title off the monster]
[The monster chases SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and the other heroes past the dump. SpongeBob then breaksade the monster with the title.]
SpongeBob: Yeah! We're going to the top of the dump building! This is where we get the title, is the title? [chuckles] Yeah! [chuckles] Wha–huh hoo? [the monster shakes SpongeBob's hand and SpongeBob falls down the building with the monster. The monster jumps onto Squidward's nose and eats him.]
Patrick: Hey, that was your napkin?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. My napkin. My old napkin collection. [points at the title] How about these old napkins? [the monster chases and snatches the collection of napkins] Hey, hey! My collection of napkins!
Mr. Krabs: [sees the monster] You should probably give up your life of crime to rid this place of these creepers.
SpongeBob: You should probably give up your life of crime to rid this place of these creepers?
Mr. Krabs: You're making this up as you go along. You don't care about the title or the law, are you?
SpongeBob: I'm not very good at this, Mr. Krabs.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk away. The scene changes to nighttime. The entire Krusty Krab is standing in the street and doing absolutely nothing.]
Mr. Krabs: Whatever you say, I'll listen
SpongeBob: I'll listen to you, Mr. Krabs. [notices a sign that says "Tonight)", which says exactly the opposite: "Tonight" – all for nothing.
Mr. Krabs: Then give me the money, and I'll make a nice, smooth Krabby Patty!
[SpongeBob gets bored and walks up to the "House of Misery" aka The Krusty Krab:
SpongeBob: Let's go see The Krusty Krab.
[The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs' office. Inside, there is a small room with a lamp, a bunch of computers, and a bunch of other stuff. SpongeBob is shown doing a lot of stuff.]
SpongeBob: [tucking his face into a spatula] Here's my spatula. It's the only thing keeping me alive in this darkness. [Mr. Krabs starts laughing] Oh, my. Getting dark! This won't stop warming me up, will it? [Mr. Krabs gets very scared and still doing nothing]
[Mr. Krabs pulls his spatula cord from his head and turns on a light that is being emitted from the "House of Misery". It's a large light emitting tube with a white tube at the top.]
SpongeBob: Thar she blows! From the front to the back! The spooky elementals outta here!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I order you: Stop the madness! And I want you to pay for it!
SpongeBob: Who?
Mr. Krabs: The evil Kruss-worshipping Atlanteans. We've got to get this over with so we can go off to fight another day.
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: If we want to get away from this darkness, we should be trying this.
SpongeBob: [gets the spatula cord and tries to pull it off] It's working!
[Sponge
