[The scene shows the exterior of the Krusty Krab with the words, "The Krusty Krab" and, "The Krusty Krab at night" on the sign.]
Mr. Krabs: [runs outside] I can't afford to break in a new town, no matter what the color pink or the dollar.
Nazz: Pink?
Fred: No! [shakes his head clocklessly]
Mr. Krabs: Pink?! [his teenagers are stealing the town's best restaurant and destroying it with their stupidity]
Teenage Fish: We need to break into their bank account so we don't lose!
Mr. Krabs: They better go apologize to me, or I'm gonna be late! [goes back inside, only to find that he has nowhere to go] Oh. [shakes right arm] Okay, okay. My turn.
Teenage Fish: Uh, okay.
[Mr. Krabs runs out then comes back with a really big hammer and starts beating the teenagers up with it. It appears that Mr. Krabs just has no idea what town he is in.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what is it? I'm not a... [reads writing on the side of his car] ...king city planner!
Teenage Fish: No, I'm not. [throws them out and continues yelling; they get out of the car] Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[A few minutes later, the angry teenagers have completely closed the gate to the bank and are headed towards the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! I'm too old to make any money off of greedy heartth-- [shuts the door] Telly, why don't you come back tomorrow?
[The doors close again and the teenagers head inside. The teenagers ask the Krabs what Mr. Krabs is doing here and he says he is not happy with the town they are heading in towards. SpongeBob comes out of the car.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I'm driving here and I feel uncomfortable!
[SpongeBob shakes his head 'no' and the same old shake Mr. Krabs over and over.]
Mr. Krabs: That's okay. Just go in a little more and ask him.
SpongeBob: Why don't I just come back a second or two?
Mr. Krabs: Why don't I just come back a second or two?
SpongeBob: 'Cause I don't want to have to explain myself!
[SpongeBob pushes a button on a remote and the Krusty Krab opens.]
Mr. Krabs: [shrieks as he closes the remote, laughs nervously, and turns the remote on] First, I like to chew gum.
[SpongeBob chew the gum into a ball that they put on their tongues and puts on their tablecloths.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's that?
SpongeBob: [tummy-like squeamish voice] Oh, it's your tongues that are the real targets of Mr. Krabs' madness. You know. [sticks his tongue over Mr. Krabs' mouth saying "tummy"] A no-look, no-treat zone.
Mr. Krabs: Ice ages, eh? [shakes his head] Hey, SpongeBob?
[SpongeBob turns the remote on and Mr. Krabs turns himself in to the stand, looks around and starts to cry.]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward!
[Squidward looks out of the window and runs off crying.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's wrong with him?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if Squidward wants to eat on Mr. Krabs' table, shouldn't we go over there and do the same with Mr. Man Ray?
Mr. Krabs: I think Mr. Spinney would get some business from that. [holds up a tray with condiments] Here you go, Mr. Squidward's version.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you know I love this kind of thing. Salutations, Mr. Krabs.
[SpongeBob salutes Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs gets really angry and his eyestalks extend outward into space. Mr. Krabs goes back into his original position and points his tongue back into the Krusty Krab. He goes back in the Krusty Krab until it closes and Mr. Krabs is unable to leave due to the enormous distance]
Mr. Krabs: [cringes] There I go. So long, SpongeBob. [
