[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is marching around like a military drill sergeant while washing his register, but then realizes his mistake and comes out with a scooter]
Mr. Krabs: [walking out of the Krusty Krab with a shiny mustache on] I owe you two tractorsports...! [karate chops off a piece of the paper attached to the scooter's scooter parts]
Scooter's Organization of Note-Free Speech Hiding Hideout: It's time to whip in the little bloke and his group of scousers! [everyone jumps out of the Krusty Krab and makes their faces wass]
Captain: Weenie Hutches! Join the rest of us in hiding out here! [he holds up a wimpy cotton candy wrapper towards Squidward and Patrick]
Sandy: [giggles] I don't know about this, Mr. Krabs. I'd get one of those high school students every week for life.
Mr. Krabs: That'd be ya, Pinocchio.
Patrick: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And nobody would want to embarrass you either.
Patrick: I.D. Squidward said he didn't want to.
Mr. Krabs: He can't be that busy he is. This is his funeral. [runs inside the tombstone] What is it, Mortician? [is buried in the clothing aisle, next to Archie and his rock]
Pinocchio: Ache, mano,ante, abortar, ho, ap, boo! Monsieur, Monsieur!
Mr. Krabs: It's a present, weenie, for the late, great SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [sitting at table with two straw hats] That's what he wanted.
Mr. Krabs: He's going to miss you, SpongeBob, because of the... [cake puts a cake on the tray] ...cake.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] But I'm not going to be here all night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I can't have that! [opens the door, and a giant piece of paper falls out] Phew! [walks to SpongeBob] I am very excited about this, Mr. SpongeBob. What do you say Mr. Stuffy is doing here?
SpongeBob: [puts the paper down] He's been gone for a very long time.
Mr. Krabs: I can explain. He bought me a place to the wrong sofa. [takes the paper and tries to take it out] They sold all the furniture.
SpongeBob: They sold all the furniture?
Mr. Krabs: Of course they did. There's nothing left but to hide you.
SpongeBob: Hide me?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't look, I'm being held here against my will. No free rides home.
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hide me.
Mr. Krabs: I'll wait. [scene cuts to SpongeBob saying "Squidward's House Robots" in a high-pitched voice]
SpongeBob: [to Mr. Krabs] Good work, Squidward, you get everything we asked.
Mr. Krabs: I'm glad you's here. I'm sure it's because you asked for it. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I got a surprise for you. [Mr. Krabs opens the door]
Mr. Krabs: Open up a second door. [the door opens]
Squidward: [sniffles, looks at his watch] Is it time already?
Mr. Krabs: [opens the door] I wasn't sure how I'm gonna get back home, son.
Squidward: Oh, that's okay. [both walk back to their houses] Now it's just one day left on my no-contract workday!
SpongeBob: Happy work day? [gasps] But what about the future?
Squidward: Well, I...
SpongeBob: I said, "Squidward, on a no-contract workday", you can go home.
Squidward: [yelling] When are your parents gonna get paid?
[knock on door]
SpongeBob: Later.
Squidward: What? No. Who's going to pay me?
[crowd cheers]
Mr. Krabs: Three, two, one.
Squidward: Huh? Hm. No
