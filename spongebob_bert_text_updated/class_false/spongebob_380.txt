[Opens the episode with SpongeBob at his house, listening to Gary's birthday song]
SpongeBob: [laughs] I still can't decide what song this song is. [tries to say it out loud] Whimper loudly. Whoosh! [makes it sound like he's going on a balloon-shaped toy boat] Whimper, Whoosh, Ring-A-Winkle.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [laughs so much that his brain pops right out and squirts air in the holes] This sure sounds like SpongeBob.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [his brain pops right in and squirts air in the holes like an accordion] This sure sounds like SpongeBob. [laughs so hard he starts falling]
Patrick: Ding ding.
SpongeBob: [his brain pops right in and squirts air in the holes like a dinghy] This sure smells like SpongeBob. [Gary is already asleep in SpongeBob's bed]
Gary: [Gary is already asleep in SpongeBob's bed]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob over the phone] Gary! Can you hear me? This is my bed! It's pitch black! [SpongeBob wakes up and looks everywhere frantically] SpongeBob, there you are! [SpongeBob gets up, puts his blanket on him, and goes to his window] Barnacles. I can't go outside. I'm out of hair. Do you have any hair on your head? [opens his window but it's empty] Time to take out the blanket! [tries to put the blanket on Gary, but he couldn't get Gary to open up] Gary, do you have to let go of my bed? Gary, Gary is all yours! [opens up the window again, when a mail guy comes in]
Mail Man: Is there a package for Gary?
SpongeBob: No, that's not a mail guy.
Mail Man: Is there a package for Gary?
