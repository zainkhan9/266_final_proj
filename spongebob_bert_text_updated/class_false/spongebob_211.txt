[Patrick's house is now haunted by SpongeBob and Squidward.]
Squidward: [growls impatiently] What do I do? Is this haunted house? Am I allowed to leave? Am I allowed to use this bathroom? Am I allowed to use that sink?
Mr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, it's just a sink. [sniffs] What's that?
SpongeBob: [gasps]
Squidward: What's all the racket out here?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't mind if I gush.
SpongeBob: Squidward, did you have to to get inside the house? I haven't even copyrighted the name.
Squidward: Where are you going to get in the Fran house?! [begins to shake]

SpongeBob: barnacles. [begins to whimper]
Patrick: Have fun! [SpongeBob walks up]
SpongeBob: Oh, barnacles, it's too late. [all the customers walk up, but SpongeBob gets them first. He sits on a chair and watches as them all walk away. Then he walks up to a customer with tired faces] I have to buy a house, now.
Fred: My house is really bad, too.
SpongeBob: What do you mean your house is worse?
Fred: My house is really good, too. [shows his house improved]

SpongeBob: All my stuff?
Squidward: All my stuff is back here.
SpongeBob: But how is this all true?
Squidward: Everything is back home.
SpongeBob: [laughs] This is horrible!
Squidward: Everybody is back home!
SpongeBob: Well, don't laugh, Squidward. Everybody here is back here.

Grandma: Nah, I'm trying to give her a present that is dear to me. [takes the hat off and rips it off] Here, you will get. [takes Squidward's present] I present. [gives it to Squidward] Oh, hello.
Squidward: What? You gave it to me yesterday?
Grandma: No.
