<Start Ep> <3
[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is eating a bowl of crackers, but his eyes, nose and mouth open up to his face is shown. He looks at the customers]
Customers: Ooh, more money!
SpongeBob: Money! [He runs up the cash register, but trips over one of his blocks. He lands on the floor and falls over]
Fred: Wow, I lost a fortune.
Customers: Money!
SpongeBob: [gets up] I should've known! I signed my knickers, I should've known! All these accidents have given me a little run for my money!
Fred: You think I lost me fortune? [hands SpongeBob a dollar]
SpongeBob: [puts the dollar in the register and winks] See ya later, Mildred.
Customers: All right! [SpongeBob hides in a chair in the back corner of the kitchen. Customers are still cheering]
SpongeBob: I got money, got it? [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs is at the register again.]
Mr. Krabs: I got money, got it? [laughs]
[A screw is driving on the floor.]
Mr. Krabs: I got money, got it? [laughs]
[SpongeBob is riding a skateboard on a surfboard. He is seen riding a kiddie ride on the board. The board hits SpongeBob and he falls over. The board hits the window of Mrs. Puff's house. SpongeBob screams.]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, go away!
[Mrs. Puff puffs and neighs. SpongeBob walks up to the register.]
SpongeBob: [finally hears a knock on the door.] Whoa! Club!
Mrs. Puff: [off-screen] Who is this?
SpongeBob: [finally hears a knock on the door.] Mrs. Puff, what is this?!
Mrs. Puff: Is it you?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, this is Club Nancy. I'm here to meet new friends. Listen up! For your sake, [mumbles] The Queens of Bikini Bottom!
[The Queens appear and slam the door in SpongeBob's face.]
The Queens: Why, hello. [flashback to when they are bloodthirsty] Ahh, the Queens of Bikini Bottom. [The Queens are still talking as SpongeBob watches in horror] Aahh, the Queens of Bikini Bottom. [flashback ends]
[Laughter is heard.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, SpongeBob. I thought your visit was for you.
SpongeBob: Sorry I couldn't hear you. I'm feeling very grumpy.
[Mrs. Puff leaves. SpongeBob runs a couple fingers over to a chair and sits on it.]
SpongeBob: [hugs the old chair] Mmm, chair, fluff it up!
[SpongeBob lays on the chair and turns into a Queens model.]
Mrs. Puff: That's some good looking now!
[SpongeBob raises an eyebrow and looks down at his model's head. He then frowns, looking like he's trying to frown.]
Mrs. Puff: Get away from me!
[SpongeBob pushes his actions so hard that the screen turns into the screen of a soap opera, with Mrs. Puff looking at him in contempt]
Mrs. Puff: Perhaps this will change her heart.
[Mrs. Puff looks at SpongeBob really hard, hoping that he will tear up and leave. However, he does nothing. She just sits there, cubic-eyed, and SpongeBob runs out of the house.]
SpongeBob: Ou-ou-ou, Mrs. Puff? [he is nowhere to be seen] Don't you understand? When you're my age, there's no reason to worry. For instance, I don't have hair.
Mrs. Puff: You don't even have a nose. [cries]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob going to the reunion with Mrs. Puff.]
Mrs. Puff: And now, let the poignant finale begin. [she whimpers while he cries] Goodbye, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob runs off sadly.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm sorry I couldn't hear you.
[Patrick turns to leave.]
Patrick: Sorry I couldn't hear you.
[SpongeBob stops crying.]
SpongeBob: Come, come back here! [runs off] Gary
Gary: Meow, meow, meow.
[SpongeBob runs off. The scene changes to SpongeBob's house going as he says. He is walking down
