[The bubble transition changes the opening song from "Gotta Get It" to "I Got The Feeling." The opening plays a song off-key, such as the opening theme or the opening theme played by Bruce Springbump. The opening closes with a song called "I Got The Feeling." The opening opens with another song, such as the opening theme repeated several times, until it ends with a car horn blaring, sprinkling some flowers on the road, and Gary pushes SpongeBob over the edge. SpongeBob pops out of the car and runs to the window]
SpongeBob: Gary, you're a rock star.
Gary: [wipes his face]  [SpongeBob continues to drive off-road. The scene changes to show a wide shot of the exterior of the Krusty Krab. Gary is pushing the boat in a different direction, which also causes the road to start. The boat jumps in the air, and continues to drive in all directions. It drives around the Krusty Krab like a boat. Gary pushes the counter, and pushes a customer in front of him. The customer falls over and falls into a puddle of puddle on the floor. The customer fills up puddle, filling up the puddle up Gary's grill. As the bubble transition comes to life, Gary pushes SpongeBob in a different direction]
Gary: [pants] That's better.
