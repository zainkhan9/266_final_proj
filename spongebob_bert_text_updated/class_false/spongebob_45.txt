SpongeBob: Hey, where'd he go? [the box falls into the kelp floor. SpongeBob's body goes into the kelp floor and he screams. He runs all the way over the counter where Karen comes in.] SpongeBob? Pieces of you sleeping? [he sees the kelp floor exploding and burning SpongeBob. He runs up the stairs and sees the box exploding as well. He closes the door, but he can still hear the kelp floor cracking. The door cracks even more and Tyler comes out unscathed.]
Tyler: It's, it's... [He points his finger and sees the box exploding. He gasps and then screams. He shakes the box as it was getting destroyed. Eventually, the box falls over and falls to the ground.] Oh. Hey! [SpongeBob comes back up from the top]
SpongeBob: Hey, hey, hey, SpongeBob! You came back! [SpongeBob comes back up from the bottom] You need my help! [SpongeBob has joined forces with Karen to make the box explode. The box then comes back up with the power tools, rocks, cups, and even some cheese on one side of it. inside it, there is still some kelp cheese on the inside. on the right side, there is a bunch of bottles with kelp bails on them.] Well, well, well.
[All of the bottles explode, causing a pile of kelp to fall on SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob comes up with a fixi and goes to clean it. The bottle that SpongeBob got after he cleanses the kelp cheese, too. He gets back up again.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! [Wonders where the box is] Huh?
[SpongeBob imagines himself inside of a box, but the box shuts itself. He screams hysterically and runs outside. The scene cuts to the four of them standing in front of the box, all full of kelp cheese. SpongeBob is at the top, while Patrick is at the bottom.]
SpongeBob: ...Has it been a while since I tasted cheese?
[SpongeBob thinks, and comes up with an idea. He imagines himself getting cheese again. He runs back up again.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, do you like cheese?
SpongeBob: Yes, and Patrick thinks it's a good idea. [thinking] Cheese solves
