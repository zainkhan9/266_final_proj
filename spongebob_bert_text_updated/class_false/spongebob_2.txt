[Episode starts when a crowd of people is gathered around the giant Krusty Krab for a special audience. A microphone is pointed at the audience and ChefBob begins to speak.]
CHEATING PRESIDENT: And so, all those who have a chance to witness my masterpiece, the greatest of all time to come out this Thursday night at Fancy! [An image of a Krabby Patty appears on the screen. An image of Mrs. Puff appears on the screen] Oh, it's a beautiful meal, Mr. Krabs. [A Krusty Krab employee approaches her.]
Mr. Krabs: I have recently decided to give me own restaurant. [He chuckles] Why, I've had a beautiful and growing garden, so I can expand it into a palace. [The image of the palace opens, revealing a bucket of patties, the patties are shaped like dollar bills, and the crowd cheers.] I have decided to give myself a royal path. [He walks away. The crowd stops.] Uh, where is that famous Krusty Krab now, ChefBob?
ChefBob:...3...2...1...
Mr. Krabs: That's right. Come on, let's go!
ChefBob: Thank you, sir.
Mr. Krabs: I hope you get to see that soon. Please keep your welcome in my coming palace. [The crowd angrily boo the employee.]
[Meanwhile, ChefBob is continuing his search for the "Krabby Patty." Tries to speak to it, ChefBob turns into a chrysalis.]
ChefBob: Huh?
[The chrysalis opens, revealing a chrysalis of Krabby Patties stacked up top. Three patties stack up top, while the fourth one is revealed to have the "Krabby Patty" in its head.]
Krabby Patty: [Off-screen] The Krabby Patty!
ChefBob: Huh?
[The screen reveals that the screen was actually a hologram projection of the Krusty Krab, where the Krabby Patty appears to have some kind of treasure chest being held by ChefBob.]
Krabby Patty: Huh?
[The screen shows a 2D scene of treasure being run through the chrysalis. The scene returns to the Chum Bucket, where ChefBob holds the chest up high.]
ChefBob: Ooh... oh my gosh... this is a treasure trove! Just look at it!
[The scene returns to the Chum Bucket with ChefBob in it.]
Krabby Patty: Huh?
[The scene returns to the Chum Bucket theme. ChefBob places the chest in the chrysalis and the chest on top of the throne. The scene returns to the Chum Bucket with ChefBob out of the chrysalis and through its window. The scene returns to the Chum Bucket with ChefBob out of the throne.]
ChefBob: [As a kid] Excuse me, young man.
[ChefBob talks to the kid about ChefBob through a children's song.]
Kid: [As a baby] ChefBob, you've got some pretty great ideas. Why shouldn't Ikie-ChefBob? [Covers his ears]
ChefBob: I want you to know that I really love my musicality and respect my musical talent. Thank you, my dear. [Chef Bob walks off] Oh. If you wanna hear some jazz, I recommend checking out this great man and his music.
[The chattering bone in ChefBob's ear short-circuits for a few seconds, then it stops.]
ChefBob: Huh? Fine! Have it your way. [Chef Bob suddenly stops his music] Huh? Where was I? [The heart breaks, the heart attacks, and the chest pains land on ChefBob. They stopped following his music.]
Tom: Thanks for the show, ChefBob!
[ChefBob walks off, the episode ends.]
