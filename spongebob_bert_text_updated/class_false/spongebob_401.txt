[The episode begins with Patchy finally waking up from his dream and noticing Gary still having the dream. Patchy sticks his thumb through the opening on Gary's dream screen and enters Gary's dream world. In Gary's dream, he is riding a bike, playing hopscotch, and eating a hot dog. As Gary sleeps, Patchy sneak behind the bed and pulls his face over, exposing his dream-screaming face. Suddenly, a giant Krabby Patty appears and the inside of his left eye cramps up, making him look like an enormous amount of steam comes out of his head.]
Patchy: [gasps] It's Patchy the Cat! I saved you so much, Potty! Get it?
Potty: Ow, hold it, Potty. I learned all you could with an essay.
[Patchy scribbles something on his thumb]
Patchy: Oh, Potty. Did you say something?
Potty: Yes.
Patchy: What's this?
[Patchy pulls out the essay and writes something on it.]
Potty: Yep.
Patchy: Writing's about learning, huh?
Potty: Yeah.
[Patchy pulls out an essay and sits it on a table.]
Patchy: Now called on: The Patchy the Cat. [Potty imagines himself as an old, great, powerful, great Britain captain.] He'll be writing for a Sunday morning paper, than handing out plaudits.
Potty: Yeah.
Patchy: And giving his opinions on what to do at a cocktail party, from a chef to a fireman.
[Patchy imagines himself being grilled on the grill.]
Patchy: What's so great about a cat? [Potty looks at his eaten piece of paper and growls angrily] Oh, he bites me in half. [Potty bites Patchy] Ow, hold it! What is so terrible about a cat? [growls] She'll eat your head, and then you'll break your brain and she'll eat your eye. Ow, hold it right there! That's not so terrible! A squirrel with half a head would never be treated this badly! [cries]
[Patchy cries a fountain of tears and tear comes out of his mouth, she shows an exact copy of an essay the Cat says she will do, Patchy watches as the tear falls and the piece lands on Patchy's head, causing his head to turn into Patchy's stomach.]
Patchy: Ow, my butt!
[Patchy's stomach ululates, and when the tear falls, the piece of tear slides out, causing the essay to turn into what looks like a head. Patchy sobbing, Patchy sits on a stool and talks to Patchy through a translator.]
Patchy: [stares at him in English] I have never been a bigger star! [touches the Chum Bucket door well and makes it wobble] I want to be a better crab! [sighs] I have a name for it! Hmmm... [voice becomes muffled] Tag!
[The scene changes to Patchy and the Chum Bucket teaming up to do a little hand-eye coordination. Patchy arranges a few ingredients on plates with ChefBob. He then walks to the Chum Bucket and pours the raw chum into one of the chum patties on plates.]
Patchy: I want the honorables on this plate to gaze at me during your cooking!
Chum Bucket ChefBob: Oh...! Oh, by the way, uh, we have a request!
Patchy: Oh...! Um, point taken! [looks at the plate and points to the chef's head]
Chum Bucket ChefBob: By the way, I'm a chef of the month! [laughs and the scene pans out to show ChefBob's face]
Patchy: Well, that's not so bad, ChefBob. What did you think we would do with a little less culinary freedom?
Chum Bucket ChefBob: Well, we had to, you see?
Patchy: Point taken! [laughs]
Chum Bucket ChefBob: Oh...
Patchy: Oh, ChefBob, aren't you ashamed you took our cooking test too?
Chum Bucket ChefBob: Well, I'm ashamed we were penalized! Not only have we been banned from the competition, we've also been ordered depots searched, and are you going to tell us why!?
[The Chum Bucket ChefBob walks into the kitchen and locks the door using his mouth, [sniffs] and SpongeBob's, [picks up his teeth] are asleep. The scene changes to the Chum Bucket ChefBob and SpongeBob are crocheted into a new scene. SpongeBob is
