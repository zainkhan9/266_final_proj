[At the Krusty Krabâ€¦]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible! I must have missed this one!
Squidward: How did you get here?
Mr. Krabs: I've got a big idea. [pulls out a book from his back pocket] Bring it over here!
Squidward: Oh, hurry! Chum is our friend! Where's the Krabby Patty secret formula?!
Mr. Krabs: Try it! Come again! [grabs more patties from the register and puts them in the register, while laughing] That's it, Squidward's right! You've just found it!
Squidward: Little fella, what are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: I got the secret formula out in the wild, with the aim of bringing it back into the Chum Bucket. [Squidward pulls Mr. Krabs out of the register. Mr. Krabs is shocked and he walks off.] No need to wonder beau, Mr. Squidward. For all we know, the formula was stolen by a recently arrivedoot here in the Chum Bucket.
Squidward: Well, that's just some dumb old-fashion-ladderer.
SpongeBob: He is a special someone. A special someone who would rule the world and shape history!
Mr. Krabs: And now, along with my beloved spatula, I turn to the time to invest in me own good.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you have two seconds.
Patrick: Thank you.
SpongeBob: [goes to the cash register, then to the time machine] One minute, two seconds. One minute. Two seconds. One minute.
Patrick: Good morning, mathemat! [tickles SpongeBob, who is eating a Krabby Patty] Huzzah, huzza! Huzza!
SpongeBob: [jumps up to Patrick, who is eating another Krabby Patty] Go, Patrick!
Patrick: [hops on SpongeBob, which causes him to stop eating] All right, I'll go grab the spatula.
SpongeBob: [goes to the cash register, then to the time machine] Patrick, I just had two seconds to fetch the Krabby Patty formula!
Patrick: Oh, I'll go get the spatula.
SpongeBob: Thank you.
Patrick: Thank you.
SpongeBob: [turns around and heads over to Patrick, who is eating another Krabby Patty, which causes him to stop eating and make a signal to go back to the time machine, but this time, he gets interrupted, and so he continues ticking the boxes, while the time machine keeps ticking, while Patrick continues to go faster, while Patrick's body keeps shrinking, and then, at the end of his lifespan, his body gets burnt out, and then, through age, falls apart, and has no one to take care of it]
Patrick: Hey, where's my milk man?!?!?!
SpongeBob: [Patrick has a cow with a can of drinking water] Here he is. [licks it] Oh, hey Patrick.
Patrick: You have a headache?
SpongeBob: Oh, the milk is coming through.
Patrick: Could I have something to drink?
SpongeBob: [takes a drink out of his can] Oh, yes. [rubs it on himself] And I know just what you need: a cup of drinking water per gal. [points to kelp kelp] Or, kelp, you could say. [rubs it on himself] And I need a little help. [slaps himself] Hey, that's not right. I need help! Hey, get back here with that guy and me. [screams and runs back into time before Patrick's very eyes, when SpongeBob smells Patrick's breath, and then when he opens the safe, he sees Patrick in the time capsule] Hey, Patrick. What's this?
Patrick: Trying to get away.
SpongeBob: Well, this is it. I'm not going through that again.
Patrick: Well, then, you'll never know. [the real Patrick wakes up, and turns on the lights] What? What's happening? [the real Patrick bursts through the door, and runs, while SpongeBob runs, and then the real Patrick gets up, and runs, and then the real Patrick grabs SpongeBob] Oh, hello. Who are you?
SpongeBob: By chance, my friend, a.k.a. The Pirate Patties.
Patrick: [in disguise] By chance?
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, this is great. The Neptunian Fable: SpongeBob the Clown was once crowned the most powerful clown
