[episode starts with a sea slug bathing in a pool of white sand. A live-action white-sand-screen background is shown.]
Squidward: Ah, the grand experiment. How many times do we have to tell you...
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: Too scary.
SpongeBob: That's it! We have to replace me with something that looks like fun!
[camera zooms out and shows SpongeBob's house. It then fades to a green room with a giant tubacle]
SpongeBob: Hey, Room 106.
[SpongeBob puts a roll of toilet paper onto the tubacle.]
SpongeBob: Where are you going?
[The toilet paper rolls land on their own and SpongeBob laughs. But the door on either side of him makes an angle.]
SpongeBob: [groans as he lands on the floor] Oh, door.
[The door slides back yet again.]
SpongeBob: What should we do now?
[The two walk to the kitchen. We then see a scene with stairs leading to the kitchen. SpongeBob and Squidward are on the first level.]
Squidward: I like to take revenge.
SpongeBob: I know. They took our stuff. [shows him the trash that still falls from the first level] Or maybe they took my kitchen!
[SpongeBob and Squidward go up to the kitchen. SpongeBob finds a stack of ketchup bottles open with a dime in them. We then see a scene of a boss beating up a prisoner. SpongeBob is on the right-hand side of the screen, playing with ketchup bottles.]
SpongeBob: [turns the screen] Nice job, Squidward.
[SpongeBob blows a ketchup bottle up like a trumpet. Then he blows ketchup fumes on the cymbals. He blows ketchup fumes on the cymbals like chirping. He keeps on blowing ketchup fumes on the cymbals. Finally, he blows ketchup fumes off of the tyrode. This screen then shows the right side of the screen. Mr. Krabs is shown. He is on the left.]
Mr. Krabs: That's it, boys! We have got what we need!
[SpongeBob knocks on the door of the kitchen, and octopus, with the handle, on John, who is upstairs, knocking, and gets hit. octopus breaks in half, and SpongeBob breaks into pieces.]
SpongeBob: Where are we?
[The octopus types take houses. One house is barricaded with a sign reading "War and Peace." The octopus that enters gets beaten up, and the octopus that entered gets her beaten up more times. The next house is revealing to be the "bowling room." The octopus that entered is chained to a "bowling room." Squidward gets beat up again, and he gets his head stomped on. The octopus that gets her head stomped on is shown, and the octopus that entered is shown getting her stomach stitched. The scene shows the "bowling room." Mr. Krabs is shown there. Mr. Krabs gets beat up again. The next house is revealing to be the "carpet room." The octopus that gets her is shown inside of it, but the cord is being twisted makes the octopus that gets her actually get beat up, which causes the octopus that gets beat up to get knocked over, knocking it down. The next house is revealing to be the "bathroom." Mr. Krabs is shown inside of it, and SpongeBob and Squidward are shown inside]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what makes you so sure you can stay? [inside the "bathroom"]
Mr. Krabs: It's time. [walks to the door] Fear not. Fear not. [goes up the curtain] Mr. Squidward, Mr. Krabs has got enough of your superstitions. Uh, why don't you get a closer look?
Squidward: Psst, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Squidward, this is no way to look at Squidward.
Squidward: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: You know, when I was growing up I was, you know, becoming... [becomes annoyed]
Squidward: Could you make me change my... hair?
Mr. Krabs: Why, sure, sure, Mr. Squidward. [becomes scared]
Squidward: Would you like to talk about it?
Mr. Krabs: Why, sure.
Squidward: Oh, boy, how could I have missed the one about Squidward? I love him so much. Love.
