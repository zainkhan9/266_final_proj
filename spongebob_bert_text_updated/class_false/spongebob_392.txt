<Start Ep> <Follows SpongeBob on his daily walk>
SpongeBob: [to his radio, then to his TV] Almost all of the SpongeBob we know and love are ugly ugly ugly ugly ugly ugly ugly ugly.
Sandy: Every single one of them picturesque beautiful looks. You know, those guys from the SpongeBob cartoon. [TV static, then back to the SpongeBob cartoon] The wholesome fish from the cartoon. [TV static again, then back to the SpongeBob cartoon] How could you?
SpongeBob: The most important television in the house.
Sandy: [TV static again, then back to SpongeBob] Look at all that stuff on TV. Why don't we take a look at the wholesome fish on television?
SpongeBob: Go on, Sandy. Just get in the kitchen of the wholesome fish. [anchor reads TV screen, then screen turns back to SpongeBob]
Sandy: Pretty wholesome? Well, if that's the wholesome, then I'm the wholesome. [TV audience turns off the TV]
SpongeBob: OK, OK, I'll be right back. [enters kitchen] I want to try something. [scene cuts to scene of SpongeBob's disgusting living] Y'all try to eat like us, pal. Like in the Krusty Krab, in the hall behind this painting... [scene turns back to SpongeBob's disgusting living, then cuts to a Krusty Krab delivery person at the door]
Delivery Fish: You need a bill to make. [SpongeBob takes out his bill]
SpongeBob: Yearly Krab. This coming Monday, January 16th, at 11:59. [thinks for a minute and seconds] I'll be living like a cowboy. [SpongeBob shakes his head] Not like a cowboy.
Delivery Fish: Your order's ready.
SpongeBob: I can't wait. [thinks for a minute and second, then speaks in a muffled voice] Maybe on Monday.
Delivery Fish: You've successfully made a delivery.
SpongeBob: Good idea!
Delivery Fish: You'll need to buy me some delicious Krabby Patties. [SpongeBob takes out his Krusty Krab key]
SpongeBob: Thank you. [enters kitchen a couple seconds later] Y'all better herself be nice than towing around a Bargun that tastes like me.
Delivery Fish: Me neither. [SpongeBob and Patrick lean in]
SpongeBob: [imitates static, but then blows the Flying Dutchman's breath] That's impossible.
Flying Dutchman: Whatever you say, pal.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Flying Dutchman... I hear you're a living sponge.
Flying Dutchman: I'm on the look out! Say good-bye. [leaves]
SpongeBob: [screams] I think we should leave Gary for the next city. He's my best friend.
Delivery Fish: No, that's not true. I was just leaving you.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Flying Dutchman... what do I get out of this?
Delivery Fish: A three-way handshake. Go ahead.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] No! [rubs his hand on Delivery Fish] It's not so good. I'm with you. I'm with my best friend. [throws the items around] I'm with you. [drives off sadly]
Patrick: Don't look at him. [scene cuts to the Flying Dutchman]
Flying Dutchman: I wanted to throw up a window and tell SpongeBob to go get his hat.
Patrick: Ugh. [imitates SpongeBob's laugh]
Flying Dutchman: Perhaps you'd prefer staying at home, but I am calling this right now. Make your way over, boy. We're going to school spirit.
SpongeBob: Good idea. [imitates Flying Dutchman]
Flying Dutchman: Egad.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hello, Patrick. What seems to be the problem today, son?
Flying Dutchman: I'm afraid you have the worst tooth in the ocean. Don't worry, SpongeBob. We've got you figured all out. [clears throat]
SpongeBob: Sorry, but we've got to get rid of this other tooth. [laughs]
Flying Dutchman: Why don't you just try and be the best you can be?
Patrick: I could be a dentist. Whatever that is.
SpongeBob: It's not really important.
Flying Dutchman: Let's not lose track. [cut to Patrick's tooth]
Patrick: Ah. [crumples]
SpongeBob
