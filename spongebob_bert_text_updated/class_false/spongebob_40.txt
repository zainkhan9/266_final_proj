[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is once again busy making Krabby Patties. He creates more patties until he stops and prepares to throw them away.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm finished! All the patties! [Mr. Krabs throws the patties away] How disappointing! I can't even get my own tanning bed. All I'll do is soak in the sun for an hour and an half. But that'll show my plants' dead spots. That'll show my broken tan. [SpongeBob is showered with lotion oil] Whoo, that's bad! [SpongeBob has algae growth on his chin] Woah, that's not bad! Woah, that's not bad! Woah, I'm tanning!
[SpongeBob is using a metal detector to look for tan bits on the remains of SpongeBob's SpongeBob. The detector picks up the bits and finds none. He then looks outside where some patties are being burning.]
Mr. Krabs: What's going on out here? Why is the Krusty Krab tanning some of these underwater fish?
[SpongeBob screams and runs away. Mr. Krabs looks through the meat on Patrick's head. Patrick is still running.]
Mr. Krabs: Give me that. [picks up the meat and hides it in a sack] There we go.
[Mr. Krabs looks through all the meat on Patrick's head, eats it, and falls into the patties. But he bumps into a baby sea star and wakes up from his nap. The baby sea star growls at Mr. Krabs and he puts his ear in his head.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [gets shocked] What's that? [gets scared and screams]
[Mr. Krabs uses his metal detector to pry the meat out of Patrick's head. But his detector picks up the meat and notices the whale.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! That's the meat from Atlantis. Looks like it landed in Bikini Atoll. Let me out of the freezer. touchbait, stop selling chum! [throws a thumping tone]
[Mr. Krabs goes to throw the temper tantrum. SpongeBob enters the freezer, unlocks the case and takes out a box of pickles.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Did you open the freezer this morning?
SpongeBob: [stifled] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, one double chewed chum-flavored present inside!
SpongeBob: [whimpers] ...meanwhile, my newest member will be on me culinary safes, while I take "guard duty" every weekend.
Mr. Krabs: And will you...
[The world pan out on SpongeBob as he runs inside his house.]
SpongeBob: All right, my highness. [holds up his mouth] I have a confession to make. I'm late for work! And neither of us have any kitchen skills. [runs up to his house with his spatula]
Highly Acting Psst...
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Hey... [takes off his high-fives SpongeBob and high-fives SpongeBob-cake] Those two are fabulous.
[Outside the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Patrick are heard giggling and rolling about. A shadow of a horde of Krabby Patties are rolling down the street. SpongeBob runs into the kitchen to grab a few patties.]
SpongeBob: Morning, Krabby Patties. [high-pitched] All right, Pre-kara!
Patrick: Morning, Krabby Patties. [high-pitched] All right, Pre-kara!
High-fives SpongeBob and Patrick: Krabby Patties. [a Krabby Patty appears on a plate] Ooh! [sniffs] Say you're hungry?
[SpongeBob looks around and saws a square in the ground, making the patties look like little squares. Then he walks up to a Krabby Patty on a plate.]
SpongeBob: Where'd you get those Krabby patties?
[The Krabby Patty pops out of the ground.]
SpongeBob: I didn't know I had a taste for Krabby Patties. I guess I won't be needing these after all, 'cause these are my new Pirate Patties. [holds up a Pirate Patty] Whoa! [sees a wave of customers] Whoa!! Whoa!!!
High-fives SpongeBob and Patrick: SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good-bye. [the crowd leaves]
High-fives Patrick
