[The episode begins on a dark and stormy night. A bolt of lightning strikes Spat, causing him to become scared and to cry. Then lightning again, making him cry, sends him flying and almost hitting Sandy. Then lightning again, making him crash into a puddle of suntan lotion and sends him flying. Then lightning again, making him scream and get hit by a bunch of stray suntan lotion and sends him falling again. Then lightning again, making him crash into a puddle of disinfection and sends him flying again. Then lightning again, making him scream and get hit by a bunch of needles and then fly away.]
SpongeBob: Sandy. Sandy!
[SpongeBob breathes heavily and then he starts to get emotional.]
Sandy: Well, that's much better. They probably won't remember anything after all. You better go on your shopping spree.
SpongeBob: shopping spree?
Sandy: Well, I want to see all your stuff. [takes out a lotion and covers his face with lotion]
SpongeBob: All my stuff?
Sandy: Yes, SpongeBob. My beautiful face cream. [shows her face cream] And my stinky fingernails. [pushes the lotion off her face]
SpongeBob: Can I have my face cream now?
Sandy: Only if you want my beautiful, never-before-seen SPATULAR cream.
SpongeBob: So, you don't want to be disappointed?
Sandy: Never ever never never never never never never never never never. Because I've got a lot of work to do.
SpongeBob: Great notaries helmet. That's an order!
Sandy: Never never never never never never never never.
[SpongeBob gives Mr. Krabs a lot of presents. One of them is a big, blue-mirrored smiley face that looks just like Sandy's.]
Pearl: [from inside] Happy 37 years, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Hello, Pearl!
Pearl: You're a little confused.
SpongeBob: I was hoping I could say I was, but it's actually been my birthday, and I like having fun.
Pearl: [from outside] Happy 37 years, SpongeBob! You got everything you need, though?
SpongeBob: [waves his arm around very confusedly] I'm not sure this is what the year's talking about, but I think the answer is definitely... [points to an old lady wearing a fez hat and holding a tray of food] Thank you, Madame Madame. I am now your sweet little lady. [the wind blows on her leg and makes SpongeBob's life total freeze] 39 years, 39 jokes, 39 fizz, and I've got to pass the stench detector. [pushes a cart with food from the seat next to her] Hey, Gina, want to help?
Gina: [from fish food] I'd like you to buy me some fish flavored food.
Jellyfish: [from a dummy] I. [from SpongeBob's rock]
Pearl: Hey, Chip, want to pass the hat test?
[Pearl passes Chip's rock.]
Pearl: Hey, Sandy, want to pass the dent test?
[Pearl passes Sandy's denture.]
Sandy: BECAUSE SHE'S A LITTLE BIRD? [gasps] BECAUSE SHE'S A LITTLE BIRD!
Pearl: Hey, everybody! That's the last thing I saw of me today. Ditto for the last thing I said.
[Pearl makes an out from her behind.]
French Narrator: Ah, Sandy Cheeks, the earth pony, must have been a little tough on Mr. Krabs.
Sandy: Everyone, watch and learn. [the banner goes up] 39 years, 39 jokes, and I've got to pass the hat test. [gives Mr. Krabs a piece of his mind]
Mr. Krabs: Behold, the test. [chuckles]
Sandy: Yes, sir! It's my life story!
Mr. Krabs: Really?
Sandy: Yep! [runs from the coat dock to the door] I got my hat because I was the first to get to the Krusty Krab, and I got my hat because I was the first to get to the Krusty Krab with the power of a thousand drums! [steps on the ground with a drum and kicks a drum] Which means I get to meet new friends.
[Sandy, Squidward, and SpongeBob sit in the dining area. Sandy peaks out of her eyestalks and sees a bunch of tables.]
Sandy:
