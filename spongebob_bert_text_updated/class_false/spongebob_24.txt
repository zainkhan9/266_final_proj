[The scene starts with a shot of SpongeBob putting a "Best Friend" sticker on his house. SpongeBob is jumping around, then he puts a second "Best Friend" sticker on Squidward's bed. Inside SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob is putting more stickers on his house. He is holding two pink hearts on his head, another one is singing and grabbing his wrist with his index finger. A green light shines below SpongeBob's house, making a Kowhon music video shot.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Let's do it! Let's do it! Let's do it! [laughs endlessly]
[A circular filety can be seen being loaded onto a truck. It pans through a screengrab of Nickelodeon Animation Studios head, showing a dark sky. SpongeBob walks up to Old Man Jenkins' house]
SpongeBob: Ow! Old Man Jenkins' house! [runs inside his house, but his screen gets smaller.] Whoa! [runs out the door] I can't watch!
Old Man Jenkins: Why are you there? I was just leaving.
SpongeBob: [pants] I have a solution!
Old Man Jenkins: Why are you there, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Because I gave you my "Best Friend" Movement! [kisses Nat] What are you doing, your-best Friend?
Old Man Jenkins: What's the difference?
SpongeBob: You got a "Best Friend" Movement instead of a "Best Friend." [spins a kisselike-like door on Nat's head and on to SpongeBob's, causing him to get angry. Then SpongeBob does a square dance with his hands together, creating a 3-D model of a heart. Then Old Man Jenkins bangs on the door of SpongeBob's house]
Old Man Jenkins: Come in, SpongeBob. Come in, Nelly. [knocks on SpongeBob's door]
SpongeBob: [angrily] Why are you there? You're not Best Friends with your best friend.
Old Man Jenkins: Why were you with me when SpongeBob and I fell in love? [looks at SpongeBob's face and shrieks] Look at that time! [scene cuts to a tired SpongeBob on a wheelchair]
SpongeBob: How 'bout some old Glove World Tour?
Nat: Oh, a trip to Bikini Bottom? Well, I could get burned out.
SpongeBob: But, then we became best friends again.
Nat: Maybe we marries and becomes best friends again.
SpongeBob: Yeah, like... scratch that notion. [clears throat] I mean, "we became best friends again." Oh, I can't stay blinded by my own pink super dupergum.
Nat: Oh, well, fine. Wait until I'm wearing a best friend costume. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: Bye, Bye, Best Friend Nat.
Nat: Oh, goodbye, SpongeBob. [flicks off the light switch and makes a giant button be held in each hand]
SpongeBob: Bye, Best Friend Nat.
[cut to SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Just remember one day, Gary. [clears throat] Good old Gary.
Gary: [laughs] Aww, campy old SpongeBob. Time to get serious. [pokes the button and gives himself a friendly head bump. The button activates a giant lump on each side of his head] So, did you become Best Friends today?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Aww, heck of a lot longer. Just this last weekend, Nat and I Entered the Rock Of Doom. [digs into hole and pulls the button off his head]
Nat and SpongeBob: Cramp! Doom! Doom! Doom! [Doom is still there, and SpongeBob and Gary are screaming, respectively, that binoculars they want for hiding and binoculars they want for hiding]
SpongeBob: Do you two not wish to stay in these two hole days?
Nat: No.
SpongeBob: [laughs] We both hope so.
[cut to episode fifty-two, when SpongeBob and Gary are flying out of the hole]
Gary: [looks at the binoculars he keeps in his head when he thought it was gone] Well, it's days nine and ten again, and it sure is a fight you're having. Stuck in your noiselessness over a meaningless obsession, you now owe it all to those super duper neat little holes you ordered filled with holes. Let's see how you do in, shall we?
Nat: Uh, how do I put them in?
SpongeBob: Well, now that we have been convinced that your obsession with pearls is over,
