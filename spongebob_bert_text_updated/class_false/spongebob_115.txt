Squidward: Oh, Squidward, it's time for another glorious episode of The SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club App. And in the spirit of welcoming another fan club member to the fan club, I hope my guest has a wonderful day! [closes the curtain and hopses into the limo he is driving]
SpongeBob: [singing his song] ♪Good times. Good times. When I'm with you, it's all about the road, it's all about the road, it's all about the road, it's all about the road. It's all about the road. It's all about the road.'♪ [cuts to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is cutting the Noxious Waste, which means that it is as dangerous as possible]
Squidward: You're on vacation, bye.
SpongeBob: That was a "bye vacation" type trip, huh, Squidbeard?
Squidward: Why on Earth would you give away a vacation? You have so many business ventures under way, and none of them are going to work on time.
SpongeBob: Yes, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth it. You're a top employee, so there's no reason why we couldn't do our jobs some day.
Squidward: [Nervously]No way. It's not every day.
SpongeBob: Sounds fair to me.
Squidward: [Nervously] OK. Let's go make some sausages.
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward, you can't leave the furniture of the past where you're not prepared for me!
Squidward:RA. [as he starts to cry another episode starts and the camera zooms into a different part of the building]
SpongeBob: I am sorry, Squidward, I couldn't hear you.
Squidward: Worse. You just left me naked in your belly, naked again.
SpongeBob: Oh, what happened to be naked again?
Squidward: I'm sorry. I had to.
SpongeBob: Sorry you didn't ask. Sorry you didn't get a chance to. [in tears] 
Squidward: SpongeBob, we don't have time for this. We have to do it.
SpongeBob: Yeah, you can't have it. You have to leave me alone.
Squidward: [gets an idea]  Wait a minute, SpongeBob, I've got a solution. I want you to hook me up to this plug so I can skip bedtime and just get home and live out their lives. [SpongeBob pulls the plug, Squidward loses his grip and pulls it in the opposite direction] Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Squidward?
Squidward: There's no easy answer. We can find a solution. Something that will make their lives a living miserable. Something that will make them listen to music that is better for it. Something that will make them learn.
SpongeBob: But what can we get for this?
Squidward: [pushes SpongeBob's hands away] Nothing.
SpongeBob: You're not gonna hook me up to that plug unless you get a really good signal.
Squidward: Not signal.
SpongeBob: You wireshark, you wireshark! [jumps into the air] Hey there, what's that?
Squidward: That. That's my guitar. It has a distortion control board, so if I mess up one, you mess up the other. So get it together, Squidward. Ready!
SpongeBob: Ready, Squidward?
Squidward: Where are you, SpongeBob? [Squidward starts to panic] I'm terrible! Monster! [screams]
SpongeBob: Ready, Squidward? [The guitar distortion board turns off. With a jack, splinter, and board in your hand, you can play.
Squidward: Monster! [screams]
SpongeBob: Ready, Squidward? [Squidward starts to panic again] Monster! [SpongeBob jumps into the hole. Squidward tries to get his guitar to move, but the splinter destroying board prevents it from.]! Squidward: Monster! [ The guitar pickup prevents Squidward from putting his guitar in. He slides out of the hole. Later, SpongeBob is in front of a painting that says 'Grim Monsters']
SpongeBob: Hmm, a monster? Oh, yeah. Just a bad dream. [ SpongeBob jumps off the painting. Later, Squidward in his house is talking at night]
Lady: [ starts to cry. He turns into a monster]
Squidward
