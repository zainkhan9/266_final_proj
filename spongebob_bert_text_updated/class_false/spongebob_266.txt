[The scene starts with Mr. Krabs in his office at SpongeBob's house picking up SpongeBob's magazine. SpongeBob walks in the door holding a newspaper while scratching. Then he comes out sliding on his rock. The camera zooms out revealing him wearing a blue and purple polo shirt with a bow on. He uses a claw on the window to pull down a dress with a red bowtie. He does a little trick with the strum, and the crowd stops.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [Mr. Krabs gets the idea] Huh? I'm not gonna show you my best friend, I got you now. [Mr. Krabs freaks out] What—[stares at the strings on the string-attaching leg, causing the magazine to fall off] You got me, SpongeBob! [giggles] What is this thing? [points to SpongeBob's reflection on the glass]
[SpongeBob gasps at the reflection, and growls in anger. He then gets an idea. The audience starts gasping, and SpongeBob does exactly that. He puts a tiny television on top of the organ and pokes it with his pole. The audience goes crazy, and freaked out, about the fact that they're about to see a ghost. Mr. Krabs is shocked, and then he starts panting] People, go away! [sobs] But I—[gets some popcorn] You always wanted popcorn, didn't you? [the popcorn falls on his eyes] Now I'm haunted!
[SpongeBob smokes a pipe. Then he and Mr. Krabs are. In the background, a young girl holding a bouquet of roses is having the flowers bloom.]
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo-hoo, Sandy! [as the old lady leaves, Mr. Krabs runs away, crying. In the background, an old couple holding babies is crying on the roof of the school.] Whoo, whoa, whoa, whoa! [the old couple pulls himself struggling to get off the roof] Whoa!
[SpongeBob is still being chased by Mr. Krabs and Mr. Krabs Jr. in the school yard. Mr. Krabs Jr. sees Plankton running away and is trying to get Mr. Krabs' money, but is stopped by the school resource numbers.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's enough, Plankton? Now, we can whip those patties up in the air for ya.
Plankton: Ugh. [takes out a bag of patties and munches them on the grill] Those are good, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: All right, launch those rockets! [laughs and ignites the rockets with Plankton's magic ingredients; he accidentally ignites the school bag of pickles]
[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket students being pedaling while Mr. Krabs and Mr. Krabs Jr. ride on a schoolteacher pedicab. Like pedicabs, they drive through streets, destroying a school's library and throwing dozens of patties on the grill. The pedicab's passengers cover their ears, noses, and mouth to prevent pickles from falling on the patties.]
Male pedicab driver: Huh? [wears a lettuce hat and lets off a pumperipher and cuts to the classroom]
Plankton: [opens up the school's doors and talks in a higher voice than usual] The Krusty Krab is far too run down the drain that it selfs.
Female pedicab driver: [blows a whistle and sends the students crazy off-road, leaving many customers]
Mr. Krabs: [takes off his pedicab and pulls out a bottle of pickles] Forget the pickles! Forget the pickles! [throws the bottle away, revealing the pickles on the schoolteacher pedicab as a schoolboy laughs and a schoolboy screams] Forget the pickles! Forget the pickles! [the schoolboy then eats the pickles and sneaks over to Mr. Krabs' side while Mrs. Puff and Old Man Walker sneak over and take the bottles, much to the teacher's discomfort.]
SpongeBob: [gets phone] Hello, Mr. Krabs? Mrs. Puff and Walker are having lunch here.
Mrs. Puff: It's today! Golly day! [as she writes it, a schoolboy bangs on the school phone] And Walker over there, too. Guess he's upset about the pickles lost.
Male pedicab driver: [whispering] Hey, you guys thinks this freaks me out!
Female pedicab driver: [whispering] Oh, it's, it's, it's,
