<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode starts at the Bikini Bottom Mall, where SpongeBob and Patrick are wondering what it is]
SpongeBob: What do you want to do today?
Patrick: I don't know. How about today?
SpongeBob: What? How? [they look like they are in shock]
Patrick: Uhh... [laughs] I got a question! [takes out paper] How do you like today?
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Great. [throws paper] Show me all the available dumpster toys.
Patrick: Oh. [jumps on the garbage dumpster and spits out toy] Hey, I know! What's all the ruckourous?
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, that's a stupid toy store! [gets out toy] I only asked them to tell me their secret formula, not to judge!
Patrick: Listen, I don't care if you are a great artist or not. What I do is ask stupid, dumb, mean, and brilliant people to do stupid things.
SpongeBob: [sadly] Once a day, never again.
Patrick: Uhh... [gasps]
SpongeBob: And never to return. 
Patrick: Uhh... [takes out a golf club] Never!
SpongeBob: And never to touch the golf club again.
Patrick: Hey, I don't want to golf! [tosses golf club in the air] Never!
SpongeBob: Never to touch the golf club again.
Patrick: Hey, I don't wanna go out. 
SpongeBob: Never! Never! 
[cuts to Patrick at the bus stop]
Patrick: Hey, hey, hey. [hops onto the bus] Huh,ugh! How 'bout another ride to the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: Don't touch the cash register!
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Never to touch the cash register!
Patrick: Hey!
SpongeBob: Never! Never!
[cuts to SpongeBob changing at the register]
SpongeBob: Here's your change, sir.
Patrick: Thanks.
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick, that's not so terrible. All right, yeah! Thanks.
Patrick: Patrick, I thought you said you were sorry for what he did for you.
SpongeBob: Sorry for what?
Patrick: You paid me to do it.
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, didn't mean it.
Patrick: Oh, don't be sorry, SpongeBob. Hey, what do you think?
SpongeBob: [gets out a bottle of mustard] Mustard? Not mustard! N-N-N-no... mustard! [mustard smashes into pole]
Patrick: SpongeBob, what are you talking about?
SpongeBob: [smacks along] Yes, sir! Uh, I think that... mustard was... Oh! [mustard smashes into pole again]
Patrick: SpongeBob, are you sure you're okay?
SpongeBob: [don't so then takes pole back] I'm just trying to concentrate on my new song. 
Patrick: Song? Don't you understand? I'm trying to... [takes pole back] I'm trying to... [hits rock] I'm going to jail! I'm going to jail! [hits rock again]
SpongeBob: [puts on yellow belt] You may not like my new belt, but you are forbidden to wear it!
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, sorry. Sorry. [throws plate] Here, let me try it. Polo. [takes plate and eats it]
Patrick: It's OK, SpongeBob. I will not be attacked wearing it! Thanks, SpongeBob. Bye. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [at Squidward's house screaming] Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: Could we see what he's saying?
SpongeBob: [spits gas and tries to run away, but gets stopped by Squidward's hammer]
Squidward: I'll give you a moment's peace and quiet. I just want to say that I'm completely disgusted with your behavior. Squidward, you have the makings of a very good neighbor. Of course, he is very good.
SpongeBob: A very good neighbor?
Patrick: Of course, son. [shows Squidward the hammer]
Squidward: There you are, my dear boy.
SpongeBob: Don't look at my beautiful wife! Have a nice life, Squidward!
Squidward: Is my life as beautiful as yours?
