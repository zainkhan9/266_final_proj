SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Do you know what today is?
Squidward: Annoy Squidward Day?
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, silly! [hears voices outside] Squidward! Look at what we're doing to his house!
[A construction worker sneaks up behind and takes out a log, writing "Barges."]
SpongeBob: "Barges"?! [gets stepped on by one of the log's legs] That's not a log!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] The Krusty Krab cooks air! It's time to open a restaurant!
Squidward: What the barnes?
Mr. Krabs: What, hello? [holds up a calendar] It's Monday, December 4th!
Squidward: First Patrick, then Eldonation, then Bikini Bottom, then Bikini Atoll. Up, down, up, down, up, Squidward the Squidward! Today is Twelfth day! That's Twelfth day of the year! Squidward the Squidward, I'm kind of glad you hearties.
Patrick: Thank you, Squidward.
Squidward: All right then. How'd you get the name, Patrick?
Patrick: Well, I got my name too in bad taste, huh?
Squidward: You're a welcome surprise, Patrick.
Patrick: [laughs] I am so, so, so, very, very glad you like.
Squidward: Yeah, this is the best day of my life, isn't it?
Mr. Krabs: Don't mention it.
Squidward: I'll admit, it was. But I do know this is the best day of my life.
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, Squidward. you're never going to like it when you see it.
Squidward: Don't you worry?
Mr. Krabs: What?
Squidward: Don't worry. I have a lot of mustard in me salad.
Mr. Krabs: [takes his mustard stain off] That looks like...
Squidward: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I just troweled it.
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, little fella. Just as I was saying, you're a welcome surprise. [walks out]
Squidward: Isn't this great, SpongeBob? I sure take a good whiff of the good life.
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Squidward?
Squidward: Why don't you step behind the cash register and tell someone how much of me wallet you have? [SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: [screams] Ow!
Squidward: Don't just stand there. Come on, Mr. Krabs. Let's see about getting this problem a clean one. [walks onto some cement] Uh-... *wOouuuuh* ...open this door? [reaches for it] I got the floors. [Rubs his feet] There. [Rubs them] There. [Rubs his legs] There. [Rubs his head] There. [Rubs his torso] There. [Rubs his arms] There. [Rubs his legs and then blows a horn] Open this door! [closes the door then talks in his thoughts] Come on, SpongeBob. We can get you to open this door.
SpongeBob: There you go, Mr. Krabs. [presses a button which causes a door to open. The door slides off the edge of the door then it hits Squidward in the head] Ouch! [Squidward's left arm begins to disintegrate]
Mr. Krabs: Well, we did it! We got you cleanse... [Squidward's arm begins to disintegrate in a rolling motion. Mr. Krabs is saved by this side of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: What's happening to me!?
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, Mr. Squidward. I have a solution.
Squidward: You mean the desire to dissolve the Krusty Krab and release Plankton?
Mr. Krabs: The only thing I'm not sure about is the word itself.
Squidward: Well, yes and no. [growls and pushes Mr. Krabs away] How does that help?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know if I...
Squidward
