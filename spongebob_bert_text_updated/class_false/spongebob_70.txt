[The camera zooms in on SpongeBob's House.]
SpongeBob: This place is so empty, it has to be filled with food.
[The camera changes to show Patrick eating three hamburgers.]
Patrick: Here's a hamburger. [shows it but doesn't have a bouquet on it] Yum.
[Patrick eats the hamburger and crams it into his mouth. SpongeBob eats the hamburger again and Patrick eats it but then has a dark meat taste.]
Patrick: Here's a burrito.
SpongeBob: Here's a burrito with cheese.
Patrick: Here's a burrito with bacon.
SpongeBob: A burrito with cheese!
Patrick: A burrito with cheese!
[Patrick opens up with scissors, hammer, a hammer, a saw, and sledgehammer.]
SpongeBob: A burrito with cheese.
[SpongeBob uses a sledgehammer, hammer, sledgehammer, and sledgehammer to hit the cheese shavings. The sledgehammer, hammer, sledgehammer, and sledgehammer causes sand to form as the cheese shavings hit the cheese men's faces.]
Clamu: [gasps] Methuselah!
[SpongeBob and Patrick struggles to break the shavings free.]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick!
Clamu: Methuselah! Methuselah!
[SpongeBob and Patrick crash into the coffeemaker and it explodes. The shavings that were on SpongeBob and Patrick are gone.]
Patrick: Oh, what had that contraption put in my mouth?
SpongeBob: Oh, that was a great idea. I wish we could get a closer look.
Patrick: You said it, pal.
SpongeBob: I'm looking for Methuselah, I'm gonna go stab you in the back!
[SpongeBob gets ready to stab Patrick, but Patrick keeps running away. Cut to the coffeemaker where Patrick is trying to stab SpongeBob, but gets shot into the butt through the head.]
Patrick: All right, I'll go stab you in the back!
[Patrick stabs SpongeBob but gets burned again.]
SpongeBob: Ha, ha, it's working! [sticks his head out the window] I can see the top of my head.
[Cut to night where Patrick is shooting his armor through theta the helmet and sends shooting stars flying all over Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob is sleeping and this time, an explosion is heard. Music is heard bellowing from the top of the tower.]
Clock: Time to storm Jellyfish Fields!
[Then a bus drops off a bunch of people with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy on the ground.]
Children: We can't go anywhere anymore!
Mermaid Man: Hmm...I don't know. But I'll find out.
Barnacle Boy: Hey, kids! Why are you all waiting for me?
Mermaid Man: You can't go anywhere, kids! Where's Mermaid Man?
SpongeBob: Where's Mermaid Man? He's never seen anything like this out here! People are dying! Bikini Bottom is a mess! Mermaid Man is Mermaid! Mermaid!
[Everyone runs out of the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs?
Patrick: Out of me way! [everyone keeps telling Mr. Krabs to get out of the restaurant]
Fish: Where's Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Out of me way!
[Outside the Krusty Krab, people are still running around trying to escape and escape with all their money. There is a knock on the door. Karen comes out wearing her armpit. She answers]
Karen: I'm Karen.
Karen: Oh, come on in. Come on in. [She puts her armpit on and answers the door]
Karen: Hey, everybody! [Someone is carrying a bill]
Karen: I want you to have this. [She puts the bill in the bill]
Karen: What is this? [Someone is talking simultaneously with the customers] Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is my money! This is my money! It's all I have! [One of the customers throws the bill away] Sorry! [smacks his money in the eye] What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
Nat: He doesn't have a money trail.
Frank: I know he did, but all I can do is keep track of me money.
[Nat finishes and looks at his watch, annoyed. The sky turns to black and the men become thieves as they start to steal other people's money. They start to walk away
