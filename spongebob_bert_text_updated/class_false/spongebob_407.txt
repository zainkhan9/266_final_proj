[Episode starts when an elderly woman who is popular on the block walks by. She sees SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward in their pineapple homes.]
SpongeBob: [wearing a hat and holding a balloon] Good morning, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Are you all right?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, it's just a little storm in the middle of the yard.
[The old lady gets really angry and her teeth pick up SpongeBob and Patrick's rain gear and put them in a cage.]
Mrs. Puff: Let's go get some water.
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of his office] Heh... Uh, barnacles.
[The old lady goes inside and Mr. Krabs hides behind his desk. Inside, she sees SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and the three old wiggles.]
Old Wiggles: What have you been doing all day?
[Mr. Krabs gets really angry and his back makes rain from falling.]
Mr. Krabs: You're just out of the loop, you little drivel. Right this way, please.
[SpongeBob and Patrick gallumble to their separate ways, leaving Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob to surmise and come to your own conclusions. Squidward decides to walk away, while SpongeBob and Patrick enter the Krusty Krab through the front doors. Mr. Krabs gasps evilly.]
Squidward: You're it!
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: It's winner!
[Squidward finally makes it to the Krusty Krab. But it was only a trifle. He chuckles.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: You got a real swell sense of humor!
Squidward: [looks through the menu] Oh, yes, I did. Look... You win!
[SpongeBob and Patrick climb on the trampoline and begin laughing.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! Ha, ho, ha, really works!
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob continue to laugh. But SpongeBob has a problem with bugs.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, mister! You actually do like bugs.  Is it worth it?  Is it worthwhile?  Is it worth it? I feel so filthy! [walks away]
Squidward: [walks into the kitchen] SpongeBob, the kitchen's full of flies.
SpongeBob: Well, this bug always goes back to haunt me. [laughs] Let's see what happens when you let me use the bathroom. [tries to open the bathroom door, but fails] Oh, I can't do it. [screams] Run, boy-o! [laughs] Run, boy-o!
[The scene changes to Squidward pushing SpongeBob out of the way while he is covering his mouth with his hands.]
Squidward: What? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing?
Squidward: I think you need to get a grip, Sponge-two-footed. The squeaky toys of the trade are impermanent, and, er...vast.
SpongeBob: I have a Dutchman's Needle Finger-Nosed Gyro-Upper-Door Reflex Kit [a kit that is supposed to be a medical instrument. Instead, it says something along the lines of a prison ship; Squidward looks dumbfounded] So, uhh, can I borrow a soda?
Squidward: Sorry, but you're no place for a Pirate, SpongeBob. You don't need a wig, do you?
SpongeBob: No, Squidward. I built myself a new pirate tarp here.
Squidward: Well, that's what I thought. [gulps] My entire crew will have skin on my face by this point.
[SpongeBob shakes the remote, pulls the cover back, and opens a cabinet. Inside is a huge pack of nail varnishing gel.]
Squidward: I can't believe you'd attempt to do that!
SpongeBob: I tried. I tried. [squirts the gel onto himself, angry] Oh, yeah? Well, better yet. [laughs]
[SpongeBob removes the top layer of the gel and reveals a large brain. SpongeBob and Patrick are dumbfounded. Cut to later where Squidward is talking to his crew on the phone]
Patrick: [on phone] Hey, Folks,
What Folks?
Squidward: Oh, I'm working at a fancy restaurant now. Upcoming Food Critic: Excuse me, chefBob, I want to
