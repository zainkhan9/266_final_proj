SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, do you know what this dial means??
Sandy: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mh-mm.
SpongeBob: It means nine, ten, eleven, twelve, [turns dial] twelve, thirteen, fourteen...
Sandy: And now, how do we pronounce 'money'?
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, m-m-money. Money, please. [puts a dollar on the dial]
Sandy: Zero. [SpongeBob laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: Uh, we're all paid off-set! That's the last dial I was going to use.
Sandy: Oh, silly me, SpongeBob. You don't need me knowing it.
SpongeBob: Thank you. [puts dollar on the dial]
Sandy: Oh, silly me, SpongeBob. You don't need me knowing it.

Larry: That's right, McGhee! [Pushes Sandy into the Chum Bucket to escape] Keep going until you get rid of this stuff off my chest!
Sandy: Pinch me! Pinch me! [Sandy falls for the prank, but since her arm was pranked, she falls flat on the ground. Her body is crusty and her arms and legs are shaking] Okay, pants. Uh, uh, okay, uhh, uhh, mmm, push it until you're the size of Texas! [grunts and makes Texas look smaller] Okay, pants! [does the same as Sandy]
SpongeBob: [screams] I'm getting away! I'm getting away! [Sandy continues screaming as the two run off laughing and tossing Sandy stuff in the air] Come on, Sandy! You gotta go or Sandy will lose her pants! [Patrick neighs]
Patrick: Going to get some poop? [takes a poop nap. Later, at the Krusty Krab] Well, I just wanted to make sure you all woke up. [SpongeBob and Sandy are still in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Oh, no good, Patrick. Too hungry.
Patrick: Too hungry? SpongeBob, I can't think of a good time.
SpongeBob: Not even a good time! You're supposed to be making me famous. [takes out a notebook and pencil and writes a few lines on the typewriter] What?
Patrick: Uh-huh. Oh, I forgot to bring some paper.
SpongeBob: No, not paper. [holds up a newspaper] This is what Sandy calls "Sandy Cheeks."
Sandy: Well, what are you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [stutters] OH, NO! PLEASE, PLEASE, NO, PLEASE, PLEASE, SAND, PLEASE, SAND, PLEASE, SAND, PLEASE, SAND-O! You have to come back, please! [SpongeBob begs, but a ladder falls down and he gets down] I'm not coming down! I'm not?! [goes down and comes up with a treasure chest full of diamonds] Here you go. [puts the treasure chest on the table] One big shiny, shiny, shiny
