[The episode begins when a group of strange creatures arrive at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is awakened by the strange noises and is flabbing as he sleeps. SpongeBob wakes up from his dream and realizes that it was only Patrick who woke him up, not the octopus.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick! You weren't supposed to wake me up this morning!
Patrick: Oh, I didn't wake you, SpongeBob. I was long gone all along. [changes back to his regular form] So, uh, how'd you like to have a nice, gentle chat with me?
SpongeBob: Oh, just a few of my favorite things to do with the extra room.
Patrick: I like having fun. Hey, SpongeBob, can we play crawlie-beaners?
SpongeBob: Oh, just one—let me know what your favorite part of the day is—with a nice, friendly handshake.
Patrick: [jumps up onto SpongeBob's lap] Okay, you're a little weirded out, SpongeBob. What are you doing here? Why you so passionately deny that your brand new restaurant will be built on trust and confidence.
SpongeBob: Just the opposite.my new restaurant will be built on the love of my own community, loyal employees with a proven track record of delivering top-notch ingredients. [grabs a hair curler] Yours is a family business, and I'm a big fan.
Patrick: You said it, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I can't thank you enough for this important possession. It's been a thrill working here.
Patrick: [sighs] I guess I've known him all my life, and I should say, I'm sure he'll say the same thing.
SpongeBob: I'm glad you trusted me, Mr. Meade. And I'm glad that you have a job that pays 100 bucks a day, and gives you no cubicles.
Patrick: I can only dream of being fired.
SpongeBob: I can't fire you, Patrick. You're my employee of the month.
Patrick: That's what the restaurant business is all about.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Meade, the Krusty Krab is a family business. [points to cards he keeps on his head]
Mr. SquarePants: What the barnacles?
SpongeBob: Have I told you everything a family business is supposed to do? No! [Mr. Meade is gone]
Patrick: [stops him]What?
SpongeBob: [pointing to cards he keeps on his head] And here's a list of our ventures.
Patrick: [holding cards] a restaurant?
SpongeBob: [pointing to cards he keeps on his head cards] And here's our personal finance.
Patrick: Personal Finance?
SpongeBob: [pointing to cards he keeps on his head cards] So do we.
Patrick: So do we.
SpongeBob: Okay, okay. [Patrick keeps on running, but he jumps in the air because he's so tired]
Patrick: [so begins to sweat]Wait... a minute. [Patrick walks up, but stops suddenly because he sees an old man with broken legs.] Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I'm the owner of a broken-down house.
SpongeBob: Oh, no. [Patrick runs off and returns with a card that says, "I'm So Looney?")
Patrick: Oh, what am I so happy for?
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. I learned a lot about my day-to-day self today. [both look through Mr. Krabs' desk for a job. Once in a while, they come out of the same wall. Mr. Krabs walks in with a card that reads "The Real SpongeBob" and "The Real Meade"]
Mr. Krabs: Hello, sir. I'm Eugene Krabs.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs. I'm here to apply for a job.
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Oh, it's simple, I'm a card.com customer. You just forward me over to their restaurant and I'll cook you down some Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that'll take care of that.
SpongeBob: Alright, I'm ready! [shows himself at the Krusty Krab] Pearlyplate Society's annual charity drive is today! [SpongeBob gasps]
Mr. Krabs: Yuck! I'll never take a job like that again!
SpongeBob: You may be an A-lister, Mr. Kr
