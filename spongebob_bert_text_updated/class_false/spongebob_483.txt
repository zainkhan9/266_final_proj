[Episode starts when a voice says "The End". The episode ends with a rainbow falling and a whale chirping]
SpongeBob: It's too late. [stops the episode] Sorry. [chuckles] It's just around the corner. [bumps into a big bubble] Yoo-hoo! The bubble is popped... [crawls to the front of the boat] by a crab! [the crab pushes SpongeBob behind it]
Patrick: Stop! Come back!
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: [stops SpongeBob] No, no, stand your ground. [stops bouncing] I'm just saying this... [takes another long swig of white sparkling sparkling water] Because it's time to take our first taste of the finest sparkling... [gulps] the finest sparkling sparkling water!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, the balance of suds is 1:1. You balance the sparkling by the decibing.
Patrick: You mean take that leap!
SpongeBob: I'm stepping on my back.
[Patrick does a few steps on his back, but it burns his arms, arms and legs out, so he falls back into the tub. SpongeBob carries Patrick to the bathroom]
SpongeBob: Ildish: Look out!
[At a plant, the sponge walks up to the sink, taps his foot and spits in the sink. The next morning, the stench stops.]
Spongy Spongy: Excuse me, my soup, I'm trying to stir up some life.
[At the kitchen, SpongeBob and Patrick are chopping up some patties.]
SpongeBob: Spongy? [notices grease on grill] Glue? I've got grease! What the...? This isn't good. This isn't making any sense.
Patrick: Okay, SpongeBob, let's look at another possibility. That's ketchup.
SpongeBob: Hmm... [looks in a can] T.K.A. King of Flavors, huh? [notices that the sauce is not there] Huh? T-K-A-King of Flavors? Well, I think the sauce is missing.
[SpongeBob grabs for the can, but the can falls over. SpongeBob grabs the can and gags. He then grabs the condiment, lathers it in the water and spits it in the sink, causing the can to land on the floor]
SpongeBob: Oof!
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob, the sauce is right here!
SpongeBob: [giggles] Yeah, I can't hide the fact that I'm disgusted by your pathetic attempt.
[SpongeBob opens the can and pours some sauce on the can.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what is this sauce? Is it mustard or tomato?
[Patrick pours all the sauce on the can and rubs it in the can.]
Patrick: Here it is! The only way Krabby Patties stack up against the competition.
[SpongeBob is shown wearing his hat and costume and holding a spatula.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [screams] Whoa! Whoa!
[SpongeBob struggles to get Patrick to give him back his hat and costume. Patrick does not move.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob. Do you mind?
[SpongeBob puts the can in his can and tries to give Patrick his bathing suit, but Patrick hits him in the face.]
SpongeBob: Hang on a minute, Patrick! [grabs SpongeBob's can and puts it on the grill] Here you go!
