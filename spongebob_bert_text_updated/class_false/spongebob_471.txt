<Start Ep> <1> 
[The episode starts with a boat driving down a road. The boat stops at a lighthouse and cuts to the boat driving by a metal pipe. The boat then hits the lighthouse's radio, causing it to go haywire. The lighthouse passes by the boat and on top of it, a crystal, a disk, and a piston, a ghost appear behind the boat.]
Dirty Bubble: [pops the disk out of the top of the disk] Come on, let's get it!
[The Dirty Bubble gets back on the disk and spins the disk around. The disk hits the cones and sends chopping grass and trees flying, making them fly through the trees. The episode ends with the Dirty Bubble looking out the window.]
