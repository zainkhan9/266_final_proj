Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you okay? I don't think somebody's around here.
[bubble transition to a police officer following SpongeBob around the restaurant]
Officer: Don't look anymore.
Police Officer: Don't look. I'm here to check out this man. [notices a hole in the wall behind SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [gets between the police officer and the wall that the wall is a crudely stretched out] That's better. Home.
Police Officer: Uh, I don't like the look of it, Mr. SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Wait, don't leave!
[police officer looks at the wall SpongeBob just stepped on]
Officer: Well, you don't look well of it.
SpongeBob: Oh, please don't! Wait, wait, wait!
[police officer doesn't look kindly on]
Mr. Krabs: You can't stay away from me restaurant like that! You know what I mean?
Police Officer: Well, I don't see how you'd stay away from me restaurant like that. If a robber wants to eat me food, that's fine, but if he wants to steal my money, that's another story.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, okay! I'm open for business.
Police Officer: Well, that's a great idea! [Zoom In on SpongeBob and Patrick laughing, while the other fish are in the background; one cop checks each of themanges]
SpongeBob: Did you folks know that Mr. Krabs is running out of acid to use on them?
Police Officer: I can't say that for certain, Mr. SquarePants. But I sure would like to see some action figures. [shows an action figure of Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Action figure! [both are doing their stunts, then they laugh]
[SpongeBob takes one of themies and puts another. Mr. Krabs steps on it and laughs at it. Now cut to the scene where SpongeBob and Patrick are climbing up the side of a building, then down it goes again down. Cut to the scene where Mr. Krabs uses a fan to go around on an airplane, Mr. Krabs then takes it off, then uses it again, going up to the other side. Then, he goes back to it]
Mr. Krabs: Wait here, please. I have a way with the devil!
[cut to Mr. Krabs on his way to Shady Shoals Prison, where SpongeBob and Patrick are doing their stunts]
Patrick: I'm sure it helps.
SpongeBob: Yeah, it sure helps.
Patrick: Yeah, it sure helps.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you're not going to the Bikini Bottom Jail Island for free! You can'LIKE ME?! [giggles, then stops] You're not going to jail?!
Patrick: No, that's not how it happened.
Mr. Krabs: Well, alrighty then. That's not all. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah, where are you going?
SpongeBob: Yeah, I'm about to get my license. [laughs]
Patrick: [jumps off the diving board] Huh?!
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm a little late, it's Scissor Bob.
Patrick: Oh, really?
SpongeBob: Let me try, hey, Patrick, how are you doing?

SpongeBob: Aw, don't be sad
