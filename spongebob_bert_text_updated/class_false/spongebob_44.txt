[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, I really struggle to make ends meet.
[The episode's title changes to "Hockey Shift"]
Mr. Krabs: Oh no. It's too quiet! All these sweet sweet huzzah boxes are empty. All the drivers are gone. Way to go. [Turns around and hits his head on the wall] I hit my head on the wall! Ha!
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab again.]
Mr. Krabs: All these sweet huzzah boxes are empty. All the drivers are gone. [Turns around and hits his head on the wall]
[The episode's closing credits shows the episode's opening and the opening music plays.]
Mr. Krabs: [Opens door to the crowd] Leave the Krusty Krab, it's time to kick back and beg for your life. And in return, I'll give you a nice big patty!
[The crowd cheers. Scene cuts to the ordering boat. Mr. Krabs comes in with a plate full of Krabby Patties.]
Mr. Krabs: Here comes my favorite cheapskate. [Mr. Krabs gives him the plate.] He'll give you all your money! [Mr. Krabs gives Plankton the plate.] And I'll ride him to the bottom of the crater and then the boom! boom! the moon for you!
Plankton: [screams] Ow!
Mr. Krabs: Ahem! [Screams as he goes to get the plate.] C'mon, Plankton!
Plankton: [screams] You mean, "cheapskate"! I gave you everything you wanted!
Mr. Krabs: Cheapskate! Isn't that the cake you want?
Plankton: [confused] Uh...yeah.
[Mr. Krabs starts to leave.]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton, wait! just wait!
[Mr. Krabs goes to get the plate, but manages to get it stuck to his head.]
Plankton: Ow!
[Plankton's head explodes and the plate lands on SpongeBob's head. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs at the Chum Bucket again with plates.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I need these. [Puts the plate on SpongeBob's head]
Mr. Krabs: Well, heh, he's not such a loser. He's just a burden. I need you to cook the Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: [Jumps into the kitchen] No, I'm not!
Plankton: [offscreen, narrating] Then prepare to be filled with delicious pride and joy! [The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs doing the dishes. SpongeBob is cleaning the counter with the spatula. Mr. Krabs is cleaning the grill with the spatula. SpongeBob is cleaning the windows with the spatula. Mr. Krabs flips the grill over and flips it open. SpongeBob flips the grill into the holder with Plankton inside.]
SpongeBob: All right, Mr. Krabs, I'll start with the original Krabby Patty recipe. [Mr. Krabs continues to clean the patty, but stops. He looks at Plankton] There. Now prepare to eat it!
Plankton: But, I wasn't lazy. And, and...
SpongeBob: Hooray! [whistles]
Plankton: [crumbles into dust as he straightens himself out] Hey, what's that?
SpongeBob: I found! A new love interest!
Plankton: [looks at SpongeBob] You mean you're putting your snail pen in there?
SpongeBob: Uhh, phooey?
Plankton: I hope not, because I am preparing to bore the little brute!
SpongeBob: Whaa-ha! Whaa-ha! [The scene cuts to a TV screen with Plankton in it. SpongeBob looks at the TV and sees a laugh-out-loud face wearing a hat and holding a cup of soda. He turns on the TV.] And the chatter in Bikini Bottom has been abysmal!
Plankton: [Comes up with an idea] Oh, no! We haven't had a single hour of television news coverage in years!
SpongeBob: [Comes up with an idea] Oh, I always like the idea that we get a new anchor.
Plankton: You said it! We're still getting it. There's only 7 hours left! Which means we're doomed! Oh,
