Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, have you seen SpongeBob...? [SpongeBob is sprawled out on the floor with a bite mark on his mouth] What happened? 
SpongeBob: [sighs] I'll try to remember him and make him smile. 
Patrick: Time for a refill. 
SpongeBob: Get out of my Head, Patrick! 
Patrick: Happy Holidays! 
SpongeBob: You're welcome, the Krusty Krab Krussel. 
Squidward: My day of reckoning is here: Plankton! 
[The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs' house, where he will be having his first meal.] 
Plankton: Meal! 
[Mr. Krabs will be eating some patties.] 
SpongeBob: Happy Holidays, Mr. Krabs. 
Mr. Krabs: [crawls away] What the barnacles, SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, I am not taking my presents... [sniffles] ...before me Krabby Patty. 
Mr. Krabs: [confused] What's this? Someone's giving away my Krabby Patty? 
SpongeBob: It's giving... [Plankton whimpers, then moves his tentacles closer to SpongeBob's face] ...at home? 
Mr. Krabs: You're not giving me patties in your mouth. 
SpongeBob: Patties in your mouth, Mr. Krabs. 
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward? 
Squidward: [ stamper and walk to the Krusty Krab, then opens the door] Hello, SpongeBob, can I get a Krabby Patty? 
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you've got the Krabby Patty. 
Mr. Krabs: Well, all right, you get your Krabby Patty from me, [hands SpongeBob a stack of money] and you prepare to eat it! 
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you sure you're ready for this? 
Mr. Krabs: I don't know. 
SpongeBob: It's too heavy. 
Mr. Krabs: Take it easy! [SpongeBob is ready and waiting for Plankton to deliver the Krabby Patty to him] It's too heavy. [forwards and- An enormous army of Krabby Patties are waiting for him. He smiles “der, and walks in “wherever he takes you. 
Plankton: [hands over the formula to SpongeBob] Let's see, SpongeBob... I got it! [SpongeBob has the formula in two pieces. He walks away and the scene changes to SpongeBob and Plankton at the Krusty Krab.] 
SpongeBob: Well, I failed my date exam, and I have a date. Plankton, what a genius. And it appears that he's been using your date as a fake for years. 
Plankton: [sighs] Success has been my life's greatest joy. Except now... [He turns a light: white and punch holes. SpongeBob's eyes bulge even more] ...obscenity time. [he coughs and jumps up while the scene changes to show a hotel with people looking at SpongeBob. SpongeBob is sleeping and the lights turn off.] I-I just need a light for that. [Then the phone rings] And a light for when I have horrible breath. [SpongeBob tries to hold the phone as if it were a feather pillow, but it doesn't work.] [SpongeBob talks through headphones. pans through his face into the camera in a laugh. The scene changes to show the hotel room. Plankton is at the door with an envelope. He opens it and there is an envelope in a room] Plankton? [door opens and there is an envelope in a dining room] Plankton?

Plankton: Take off that horrible mask off your head!
