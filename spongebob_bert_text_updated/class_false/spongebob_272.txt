[Episode starts at the Discount Grocery Mart. SpongeBob and Squidward sit in chairs at the counter, and SpongeBob opens and closes its doors slowly]
Squidward: [sighs] Making One At Home...[Laughs] Is what I do-ing to make myself more money.
SpongeBob: Aww, I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!
Squidward: I just love to make stuff.
SpongeBob: SpongeBob's the best!
Squidward: I'd love to try, but my credit card balance is way too low!
SpongeBob: I'd have to be in the military!
Squidward: Have some decent shoes for your feet, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I was in the military, all my life!
Squidward: What the...?
SpongeBob: I liked the shoes, but now I'm not in the bootlegger club!
Squidward: Fine, shoes, but when will my license or my driver's license be worth anything?
SpongeBob: I don't even have shoes!
Squidward: [Walks out of the closet] My shoes!
[Scene cuts to the customers eating their meals]
Larry: One Krabby Patty!
Fred: Me?
Larry: Oh, man. I said to my insurance agent, "If I get hit by a bus again, will you pay for it?"
SpongeBob: If it weren't for my green card, I wouldn't have to take off...
Fred: No!
SpongeBob: If I were to get hit by a bus, I don't think I'd be in my apartment building!
Larry: Let's forget about that! [Stands on window, walks to the window, and pokes it shut]
SpongeBob: Let's leave, then! [Walks to Fred, but notices the card was not a Krabby Patty] Oh. Stop it! [Takes the card out of his hand] You don't understand, I only have one hand.
Fred: [Takes the card out of his] No way. Look. It's. My Krusty Krab paying for your bus rides. I'm not paying you.
SpongeBob: Oh, please. Don't tell me you's costing me money.
Larry: I'm just showing you my room, Mr. Potty. [Takes out a $.50 bill from Fred's pocket]
Fred: [Sees the bill and gasps] It's for my mattress.
SpongeBob: Good idea! We'll charge you for it. [Walks in front of Larry's bed] Uh, Mr. Krabs, I'll check your address book. [Walks in front of his living room] My room is, uh, the mattress store. And it ain't all bad.
Larry: I searched the web, and none of it has been worth it!
SpongeBob: I searched the world, and none of it has been worth tilting my mattress.
Fred: Wow, you're a great friend of mine.
SpongeBob: You know, guys, from what I've seen of your activities over the years, I can't imagine anything better than being a mattress abuser!
Larry: I. [Takes out a mattress and pours some on it] Oh, don't worry, Mr. Potty, I'll look into it.
[Cut to the point at SpongeBob's living room]
SpongeBob: Here's my living room. It is the most beautiful, relaxing room in the house. I'm gonna... [Looks at couch, reveals pillows, some cushion, some pillows on the sand, some pillows covering sore feet] Uhh... I don't know. When do we get downstairs?
Larry: [Looks at stairs, SpongeBob's living room is the first to spring to life] First, I like to take you up... [Goes to the front of the stairs, climbs one set of stairs, then climbs another set] Up.
SpongeBob: ...down.
Larry: And then I like to take you up on your mattress, just up... [Goes to the kitchen, takes a fork, and puts the bed fork into the pot] ... up on my mattress. [Takes out some stinky popcorn]
SpongeBob: And that's what I'm gonna do with my mattress, [Takes out a some burnt sofa] burn it to a crisp.
Larry: Okay, so how do we get into your living room?
SpongeBob: [Looks at the clock, realizes it's a dead zone, and goes to pull the rug off] Not like that. [Rugs the wall in place, and goes back to doing his
