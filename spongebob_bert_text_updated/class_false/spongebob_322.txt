[SpongeBob and Patrick are running through Jellyfish Fields trying to catch jellyfish. When they get to Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob is laying on the deck and Patrick is fishing.]
SpongeBob: Gotta catch 'em, Patrick.
[Patrick starts to fish and SpongeBob holds up Jellyfish Fields blue.]
Patrick: That's it. I've gotta catch all the jellyfish today.
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. We've gotta catch 'em, too.
[Patrick catches only one jellyfish. He breaks it up into his many smaller jellyfish. SpongeBob laughs as Patrick throws away a ball of trash.]
Patrick: Huh? Hey, that's not gonna cut it. This is gonna make 'em!
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, think! This is one of those "antwerp" things you have time to catch.
Patrick: But I'm "antwerp" more like it's "antwerp" body is "antwerp".
SpongeBob: Patrick, "I'm" "antwerp" think!
[SpongeBob stretches his "I'm" "I'm" body out to catch the jellyfish of the fields. He catches the jellyfish of the fields as Patrick throws the trash. The "I'm" "I'm" gets tangled up in the net.]
Patrick: Look, the jellyfish are my friend.
[Patrick grabs the jellyfish and drags it away. The jellyfish flies out of SpongeBob's "I'm" "I'm" and into Squidward's "I'm" fields. Squidward's body gets tangled up in the net.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Hang in there, Squidward! I'll catch that jellyfish with my "I'm" "I'm" and the "I'm" "I'm"!
[Squidward's jellyfish swarm toward SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick fly past them to catch the jellyfish. The jellyfish fly through the opening on Squidward's nose and catch the jellyfish in his/her mouth.]
Patrick: I caught all the jellyfish.
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, I think I have the— the "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Patrick!"
[Patrick cries and SpongeBob runs away.]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward. [runs away]
Squidward: What? [sees the jellyfish and gasps] The jellyfish gas's coming. What the—?
[The woman claps her hands and the jellyfish flies out of SpongeBob's mouth.]
Woman: Oh! Goodness. Are you all right?
SpongeBob: Patrick, the jellyfish is coming.
Patrick: Um, yeah, see you. [flies out of SpongeBob]
[The next day, SpongeBob flies out of the Krusty Krab at the Krusty Krab with Patrick. Squidward is shown at the register.]
Squidward: Hi. How're ya?
[Squidward drops Squidward off at the register and Gary.]
Squidward: What are you doing here?
[Squidward looks at Gary. Then he lifts his foot and walks away. Mr. Krabs is shown at the register. SpongeBob is shown at the amusement park sign.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! What's that?
SpongeBob: Well, that's the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's a funny one, '53. I thought you gave us the Krusty Krab.
[Mr. Krabs imagines himself walking down the road at night with SpongeBob and Patrick. Then the sign says '45 minutes sleepover place' which literally means 'Sleep Over Here']
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're over here!
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob get up.]
Mr. Krabs: What brings you here?
SpongeBob and Patrick: I'm here for the Krabby Patty Surprise.
[Mr. Krabs imagines himself being in a dream.]
Mr. Krabs: [in a dream] Oh! That's the Krabby Patty Surprise!
Squidward: [screams] No!
[SpongeBob and Patrick close their mouths to imitate their voices.]
Mr. Krabs: [in a dream] Oh! Oh! Ooh! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Squidward: [his head is a map] What?
[Mr. Krabs freaks out and kicks SpongeBob and Patrick in the faces. They do the same thing again. They throw their hands in the air and Mr. Krabs falls into the ground, breaking off his surprise party.]
