[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is marching around like a military drill sergeant while wearing a solider helmet.]
Mr. Krabs: Now, we're here to collect all the Krabby Patties, seal them, and get those patties ready for the saloon!
[Mr. Krabs prepares to pull out a list of all the patties he wants, but Plankton appears to have abandoned him.]
Plankton: No! Uh-oh. No!
[Mr. Krabs goes to meet Plankton in the kitchen of the Krusty Krab. It is so dark out, it is hard to see inside the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs gets a bit scared at the sight of his clothes, but he sticks to his duties.]
Mr. Krabs: Go on, make me some money!
[Mr. Krabs throws Plankton a bowl full of waterlogged toilet paper so he'll drown if he tries to return them.]
Plankton: [sees Mr. Krabs' reflection in his reflection] You're gonna need it! It's like riding a bike, only with the brakes...
[Mr. Krabs stops riding his bike and pulls the plug, making Plankton's boat spin.]
Plankton: Look, boy, I got you no problem this time. [sees Mr. Krabs' way] Hey, Mr. Krabs! Someone left me money!
[Plankton grabs the money and tries to call Mr. Krabs' cell, but was unsuccessful. Plankton begins to hear the conversation going on in Mr. Krabs' head, so he begins to see SpongeBob and Squidward playing cards.]
Plankton: Oh, what have I done? I'll sabotage the restaurant!
[Mr. Krabs dumps a bucket of bad creatures back into the restaurant. Then comes back with a sculpture of Squidward.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm stealing the Squidward statue! That's the greatest day of my adult life!
[Mr. Krabs stuffs Squidward's face on the sculpture and it rips into pieces. Mr. Krabs looks through his telescope and sees Squidward wearing a medieval attire, holding a crossbow and a crossbow bolt.]
Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [throws Squidward in the middle of the ground and brings it to Mr. Krabs] Here you go, Mr. Krabs. [pulls the bolt and strikes the crossbow back at the creature with it]
[The creature spits out the bolt and Squidward laughs at him. SpongeBob pounces on Squidward and runs to the restaurant while Mr. Krabs is gone, saying hello to Mr. Krabs in a high-pitched voice while stepping back with his hands in the air, stepping on many patties, and knocking over many patties. Moments later, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs appear.]
Mr. Krabs: [gets hit by the patty and screams loudly] SpongeBob? Where are you going? [sticks his face on the patty] There's a mad snail in here.
[SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs and tells him that Plankton is going to destroy the Krusty Krab and his band of r/Krabby Patties! He then goes on a date with Squidward.]
SpongeBob: I'll annihilate him, sir.
Mr. Krabs: [gets an idea] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! [stop being ridiculous and sits down] I'll [get angry and angry] buff all you want, [get an angry SpongeBob] but there's one condition: you have to kill him!
[cuts to them walking down the street]
Plankton: [laughs] That's it! I'm gonna get rid of all my corrupt business associates and friends in a matter of a few hours.
SpongeBob: [start guzzling the customers' drink] Yes.
Plankton: [start drinking his customers' drink] Ah, that's what I hoped for, SpongeBob. Now move to another neighborhood and have a little fun with it. [He hears a squelching noise and falls down. He sees Patrick building sand castles]
Patrick: [Stupidly, ahead of them]Hey! Why don't you join the gang?
SpongeBob: I can't join, Patrick. The leader calls him "Mister Flankton."
Mister Flankton: Ha! You'll be teaching me the all things that you'll need to become a great master builder. [He's be
