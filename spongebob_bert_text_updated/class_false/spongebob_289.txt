[The camera zooms in on SpongeBob. He narrows his eyes]
SpongeBob: Hello.
Patrick: [zoom in on SpongeBob's face] Hello.
SpongeBob: I must be dreaming.
Patrick: Eh? [points to SpongeBob's head] Eh? [points to Patrick's head] Ah! [points to SpongeBob's head] What is that? [points to Patrick's head] What is that? [points to SpongeBob's head] What is that? [points to Patrick's head] What is that? [points to SpongeBob's face] Ooh! [zoom out to reveal SpongeBob's face again and then back to SpongeBob's face] I'll never be able to define the imagination you've been dreaming of. [close-up of SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: What is it now, Patrick?
Patrick: I don't know, but it's getting... [close-up of SpongeBob's face] ...funky.
SpongeBob: What is it, now?
Patrick: I don't know, but it's pretty fun to have you back. [close-up of SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. I guess I'll take that back.
Patrick: [zooms in on SpongeBob's face again] I don't know, but it's nice to be home.
SpongeBob: You can relax here all day. The kitchen's all ready.
Patrick: Yeah.
[cuts to later where Patrick is still using the same grill. Squidward pops out of the binoculars]
Squidward: Hey! What's going on over here?
SpongeBob: [Squidward reading a magazine] Hi, Squidward. [Squidward gets an idea] That you'd like to hear a different forecast for Bikini Bottom, my weekly diary.
Squidward: [thinking] How's that for urban sophistication?
SpongeBob: This will be fascinating. What other things could be cool this weekend?
Squidward: Well, whatever.
[cuts to later where Mr. Krabs is at his desk writing at 8:00 a.m. on a leashed worm's tail]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's me Sunday ritual. All right, what do I do on Sunday? Over here.
SpongeBob: On Sunday, is my tail? Leashed? It's a little worm that you sow's on the side of your face and give it a little lather.
Mr. Krabs: Lather? What do you mean? Leashed? [SpongeBob looks surprised at the revelation] Oh.
SpongeBob: Oh, great. Just wonderful.
Mr. Krabs: What's so great about being shorthanded, boy-o?
SpongeBob: Simply put, it means I'm spending all my money!
Mr. Krabs: What an understatement.
SpongeBob: You're right. It means I'm spending all my money!
Mr. Krabs: That makes me so happy.
SpongeBob: [laughs] It means I'm spending my money, too.
Mr. Krabs: Well, make up your mind.
SpongeBob: What would you like to have, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I can't give you any of that "arn" stuff, I'm a... a... [he tears off his "art" and shows his "art" with a sausage] ...curvy young cutie.
SpongeBob: Oh, anything for a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's what I would like to have.
[cuts to later where Mr. Krabs has a beard on his face and is wearing fancy shoes on the floor]
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's not what I would like, either.
SpongeBob: Well, you can't have anything you wouldn't have, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's okay. [Mr. Krabs puts SpongeBob's shoes on him] Here, let me have this. [SpongeBob gets his work clothes]
SpongeBob: Okay. [hands Mr. Krabs a bag]
Mr. Krabs: And this is the bag?
SpongeBob: [angry tone] I'd like to present to you, Mr. K. The K.R.A.T.A.F.B.S. is down to your last tank, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [happy tone] Well, good luck with that. I haven't seen you in months.
[cuts to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs in the store]
Mr.
