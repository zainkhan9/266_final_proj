[Outside the Krusty Krab, a delivery truck blows up. The customers cheer in the background.]
Karen: How is it now, Mister Krabs?
[SpongeBob looks out the window.]
Customers: [cheering]
[Mr. Krabs delivers the Krabby Patty to Karen.]
Mr. Krabs: It pogo-charts! That's the new dream!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Karen at the register.]
Karen: What gives?
Customers: [cheering]
Karen: We don't have time to shop for a Krabby Patty right now. Please keep your customers waitin' for 20 minutes.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Karen at the register again.]
Karen: I'll have one Krabby Patty. How about this Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: [Points to second Krabby Patty] Anything...La-la-la. [Karen shakes her head] Oh, I don't think so.
[SpongeBob shakes her head. She shakes her head again.]
Karen: Hmm, well, it's a-okay, SpongeBob. That gives me an idea. What is this?
SpongeBob: Oh, this is this. [Points to both of them trying to get hard for a sec] This is fantastic!
Karen: Will you get that?!
SpongeBob: [Cheers in a small, happy voice] Let's get back to the Krusty Krab!
[Both of them get back up and walk down the hallway.]
Karen: I really do think we should go.
[Suddenly, the phone rings. It's Karen.]
Karen: Hello. My name is witness to the finest hour in all of Krabs' business. So far today, all of the customers price-for-pricing me precious Krabby Patties and I have nothing but pleasure! [Laughs evilly] Well, I almost feel the twang of a fish's tail.
Karen: What are you doing here, unpaid intern?
[The waiter hands the cashier money, which is in a bill form]
Unnamed male waiter: Take the bill. [Unnamed white waiter sits down at a table and chews on the money]
Unnamed male waiter: And, um, is this what I think it is?
Karen: $4.19. That's a lot of hot wings out there.
SpongeBob: Wait, please. I've got to come with you. We can start our lunch now.
Karen: Are you sure? We've got to hurry here.
SpongeBob: I'm not sure what to make of this.
Karen: What?! How can this be the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: I don't know! I've never been there. What do you think?
Karen: Whatever you make of it, don't leave.
SpongeBob: I know it must be a steaming pile of rusty old pickles.
Karen: I know it must be your grandma washing the pickles.
SpongeBob: I know it must be...
Karen: Shivering?
SpongeBob: I know... I know it's you! [Laughs]
Karen: I hope my date has a good time and wants to make some Krabby Patties.
[The shrimp cocktail slowly turns over. The scene changes to show SpongeBob's house. The window looks out on the street and shows SpongeBob's pineapple house. SpongeBob's TV then appears in the background.]
Phil: Hey, SpongeBob! We're on our way to a bratwurst frenzy!
SpongeBob: I know where to look!
Phil: That's great! Let me make something simple.
SpongeBob: In the spirit ofit√©, Phil!
Phil: Hey, pal!
Phil: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Is there something wrong, Phil?
Phil: Yes, in that case, I'd like to know how you're doing.
SpongeBob: Well, what can I do?
[SpongeBob drinks the sparkling Krabby Patty.]
Phil: That's good. Now what can I do?
SpongeBob: You know, I don't like to-night, 'cause I get lonely.
[SpongeBob shakes the sparkling Krabby Patty. He rubs it in his mouth for 20 minutes, then rubs it back in. Then he rubs it all over himself and gargles it.]
Phil: So, what do you think?
SpongeBob: I think that that patty tastes like.
[SpongeBob shakes the patty.]
Phil: Well, it smells horrible
