Squidward: I had no idea you had this much muscle. And you must've been working out all day! [Squidward notices Patrick doing pushups] What the...? [pan across room] Hey, Patrick, what're you doing?
Patrick: [lifting barbell with one hand] I'm wondering if I could borrow some from the yard sale.
Squidward: [Points to barbell with both hands] Should I go to the yard?
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: [lifting barbell with both hands] Could you help me up there?
Patrick: [lifts barbell off the ground] YES!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both jump out of the library and onto sand] Aww, yeah.
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm just dusting my napkins.
SpongeBob: [gasps] You did?
Patrick: No. I just love the outdoors!
Squidward: [walks out of the library and onto the ground] I've got you covered. [as he walks away, a giant clam comes out and eats him] Hey, what's going on in here? [running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] Hey, Squidward! [continues running after the clam] I gotta get home! [slams his face into the glass door] Oh, sorry, Squidward. I couldn't...control...that. [Squidward opens the door and sees a clam eating a rock; he groans as the clam swallows him] The foul stench! This is no fun! I am gonna have some fun! I promise I won't let it eat me... [the clam spits out a rock at the same time as one of the clam members spits out a rock at Squidward, causing him to whimper in pain. The clam spits more rocks at SpongeBob] And I promise I won't forget this guest! [the other clam members begin to spit meat at him as well] I am going to have to ask these men... [the three members of the Flying Coffin try to comfort him] ...before I do that... [The Flying Coffin slaps him, causing him to spit on SpongeBob] ...hitting his nervous system! [SpongeBob feels hesitant about touching him, but the Coffin pushes him into the door, knocking him over and over] Good thing I took my cuckoo stick off.
Flying Coffin: Nice job.
SpongeBob: Hey, you like cuckoo sticks too. [SpongeBob stretches his tongue and gets the hang of it]
Flying Coffin: What? Oh, I don't get it. You don't twiddle your pencil like that all the time?
SpongeBob: Never mind! I've got what I need.
Flying Coffin: You look funny! [SpongeBob twirls about with his pencil in one hand and hammer in the other] How are you dressed?
SpongeBob: This is more like home, you know. [Flying Coffin throws SpongeBob and we see SpongeBob in a green, flower-styled house with a flower pot, a woodwind, and an accordion. SpongeBob also has flower portraits in his wall. He is wearing a flower hat and holding a bucket. He is walking with a mop and a bucket, and he drives a red, lava lamp. He is walking with a boat, and he opens the door.] And now, the mystery of the seven trials has been solved! [SpongeBob and Squidward sit in the chair]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Did you say "here"?
SpongeBob: Uh... did that?
Squidward: Well, how do you pronounce it?
SpongeBob: Uh... uhh... liar! [SpongeBob mops up Squidward's mouth]
Squidward: liar! [SpongeBob throws mop on Squidward]
SpongeBob: Did you say "here?"
Squidward: [starting to sob] Where's my boat mobile? [SpongeBob
