[The episode begins at a dinner party at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob and Patrick are playing a board game with Squidward, who is sleeping, when the mailman appears.]
SpongeBob: Hiya, Mailfish! This lovely mailfish is delivering papers. [Squidward imagines himself in the picture] In the midst of a newspaper flipping in the dump, I came across a newspaper marathon happening to me. [SpongeBob's imagination ends] So I asked my friend, probably best friend, to look into this. Um, I found this [pulls out a pair of newspapers] [taps on one] [tip toes a little] [picture of a square knot]and then this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this! [tries to pull the papers off but can't] This, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this. [tries to remove the papers, finally putting up a lightbulb] But no, nothing can stop me from crowning SpongeBob's Best Friend as my new best friend! [tries to pull the papers off, but nothing happens] SpongeBob? [a bunch of SpongeBob's friends are standing there with umbrellas]
Squidward: What is going on?
SpongeBob: Best friend... sitting in the street? [looks down] My best friend is watching TV!
Squidward: What is going on?
SpongeBob: Best friend is... [puts on his Kelpo Green shirt. He sees a bunch of newspapers with "COMMUNITY" and "CONGRATULATIONS" on them] In the newspapers... you have "The Onion Patch" and "The Onion University."
Squidward: The newspapers?
SpongeBob: Yeah, they're awesome. We can't let anything happen to us! Best friend?
Squidward: [Angry] No! [walks off]
SpongeBob: [Barges into the kitchen. A fork is seen on the cob. He uses the cob to make butter but spits it out] WHAT?! [He sees a microwavable beverageon the cob. He starts to eat the scraps and the dish is launched off the grill to the window. Squidward finishes writing his piece]
Squidward: [Gets interrupted by SpongeBob's newspaper reading. Cuts to the newspaper office where Squidward &amp; SpongeBob sit down. SpongeBob browses the office while Squidward reads a newspaper. SpongeBob makes a Krabby Patty for Squidward, while Squidward Bucks a Patty to Squidward. SpongeBob pours some on top, while Squidward sucks his thumb. The top bun is cut, and it falls on Squidward. SpongeBob begins to eat his newspaper while Squidward continues to eat it. SpongeBob begins to eat his newspaper while Squidward Bucks his newspaper. SpongeBob begins to eat his newspaper while Squidward Flicks his thumb on the sheet. The bottom bun is also cut, and it falls on Squidward. SpongeBob begins to eat his newspaper while Squidward Licks His Wrist. The bottom bun is also Dusted because Mr. Krabs was offended by it. SpongeBob begins to eat his newspaper while Squidward Bucks his newspaper. SpongeBob Watches some books while Squidward Bucks his newspaper. Mr. Krabs Walks by.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... [turns around and sees SpongeBob bathing in the newspaper] What the...? SpongeBob, I think your paper's expired.
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What paper?
SpongeBob: The Good Morning, Patchy.
Mr. Krabs: It's not a paper anymore, Patchy knower!
Patchy: Oh, so that's how you liked it?
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] You're gonna like this! [Scene cuts to the newspaper store where Patchy is walking around selling novelty items] There's an old lady there selling things old and new! [Old Lady Smells Your Drink and You Like It] Hey, Smelly, want to read some reviews?
Squidward: You like? Yeah, I do.
Mr. Krabs: [Furious] reviews?! [Walks to SpongeBob] Wait, didn't I just get a discount? Do people come here for free? Do people come to the paper for free?!
SpongeBob: If you didn't already... [Looks out window] if these two blubbering morons are Patchy the Pirate, then what are we gonna do with you?
Patchy: Oh, this old wrinkled up here
