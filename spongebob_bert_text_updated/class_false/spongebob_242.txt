[The episode begins with Gary running to the Krusty Krab. He gets there after seeing the 'Help Wanted' sign]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello! I'm so glad you're here!
[He imagines himself in the Bubble Cruiser, with the words 'Help Wanted' on his helmet.]
SpongeBob: Thanks for helping me out there, Gary.
Gary: [happy]
SpongeBob: Woohoo! [he runs up to Gary with the bubble and knocks on his door] Oh, hello! I'm so glad you're home, you know? [he walks right into Mr. Krabs' office, and knocks on the door] Oh! I'm sorry! Could you come in! I need a bubble!
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of his office] I...no, I don't.
SpongeBob: Good! Maybe if I get Gary the pet bubble, he'll come out and help me out.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm not really home.
SpongeBob: Hmmm...well, I guess...maybe.
Mr. Krabs: You can come in. [Pet Bubble comes out to Mr. Krabs] What do in a little while, little one?
Pet Bubble: Oh, just this morning.
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about? You're never taking a bubble anymore!
Pet Bubble: Actually, I...[gets licked by Mr. Krabs] On second thought, I'm gonna watch out. You don't scare me with a bubble, do you?
Mr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob. You're right. I'm watchful over Bubble Buddy. I've seen Bubble Buddy before. [crawls behind SpongeBob] There, there. [crawls behind Pearl] I was watching.
Pearl: Really? What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [laughs] It's Bubble Buddy.
Pearl: You know, for all I know, he could be some kind of maniac.
SpongeBob: Oh, that would be... [Pearl knocks on his door and he opens it]
Pearl: Oh, come on, SpongeBob. Let's go get a bite to make yourself disappear.
SpongeBob: [opens door] Nothing. [Pearl knocks again] No, nothing.
Pearl: [Pearl pushes him away] Why?
SpongeBob: I think you...[curtain collapses and SpongeBob gasps]
Pearl: Come on, come on, you're not that abnormal. You're Neptune. Why, I'm the most normal. Wait, what?
