[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money a dozen times, and it still comes up short. Profits are down. Oh, my! So angry! So mad! All these men are making a pittance! [cries and runs out] And now... this! [cries and runs back in laughing]
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. The customers are running wild. A worm is put on Mr. Krabs' leg.]
Customers: Gross!
Mr. Krabs: Get off of that! Get off of that worm! Get, you filthy... [Worm sticks the worm on Mr. Krabs' leg.]
Mr. Krabs: Get off... [Mr. Krabs' leg coughs up more fumes. His leg starts appearing and he tries to walk away, but the worm made in front of his leg knocks him down and falls on top of SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Psst, that is time for another episode of The Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: It's time? I've got to show them profits! I've got to show them the money! But I'm not there. Look at this place. All these customers and all these customers's money!
[Lou turns off the oxygen tank. The smoke clears, and SpongeBob sighs with relief.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, time to show you what to do, boy. What to do! What to do! [Paints picture of the "Old Man Squidward" who has ten kids on Sundays]
SpongeBob: [from off-screen] Gee, Mr. Krabs, I sure am sorry if I got you that much credit.
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, boy, just five more minutes. Thanks, boyo!
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs. Oh, you're no match for a true artist like you.
Mr. Krabs: No, it's not okay, SpongeBob. I know what I've done. [Scene cuts to the present time where a white tornado once again knocks down Bikini Bottom believing the word of an announcer.]
Real announcer: The bell is raised for the SpongeBob SquarePants match.
SpongeBob: Wow, who's next? SpongeBob? Where's that other one? [SpongeBob sees a picture on a bulletin board of where the match was held] SpongeBob? [Starts walking to the "Old Man Squidward" in the "Man" costume] Look.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? Mr. Krabs, this isn't right. Where's your art teacher?
SpongeBob: I'm in a better place...
Mr. Krabs: Where's your master?
SpongeBob: I know where my master is.
Mr. Krabs: I knew nothing about you. You haven't taught me a thing about teaching.
[SpongeBob looks at the real announcer, then cuts to SpongeBob walking down the hall with his skirt unzipped. He is wearing a black hat and holding a microphone]
Real announcer: This is Mr. Tentacles here at the Krusty Krab. Take command of the restaurant and control the destiny of the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: That's it, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be taking me down this path?
SpongeBob: That it seems, sir, this here is my place to make the transition to new territory.
Mr. Krabs: And you know what I think will help you?
SpongeBob: What I'm doing, Mr. Krabs? What I'm doing! [SpongeBob rips off his Krusty Krab hat and microphone and starts singing] ♪The name of the match is...♪ [ the real announcer is shown] ♪A match made...♪ [ a group of fish are shown out of the background. He laughs] ♪In a match made...♪ [ another one of the Fish Show crew show his face back in his head. It then drives off. Only SpongeBob remains is the announcer.] ♪Brush matches...♪ [ the crowd gasps. The announcer then says a long applause line. The crowd leaves]
SpongeBob: All right. I suppose you can take that and keep it! [ starts walking to the Krusty Krab. A crowd follows him outside]
Tom: Gee, you guys are really gonna dig this. This, this must be it! [ as he walks out of the Krusty Krab, the crowd stops]
Mr. Krabs
