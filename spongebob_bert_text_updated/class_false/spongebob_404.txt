Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, look. We're on the road. It's what it is. We can all agree with you that he's the greatest road-truck driver in the world.
Mr. Krabs: I agree with you, boy. We're a two-horse race. We make it two races and it's the straight line without the Bikini Bottom express.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: The Bikini Bottom express is only for the money. [as he points ahead] There, there. That's it. That's the Bikini Bottom express for sweet, sweet pineapple land.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, don't you think you might be on to something here?
Mr. Krabs: Sweet, sweet pineapple land! I don't grow them grows, remember? [throws away the growler] You're on your own.
SpongeBob: You too, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I grow 'em crops get them crops, grow! [shows a tall green growler, which is actually a pineapple, but with a steeple; Krabs bangs his head on it] Whoa! [notices the growler] Nuttin' holes. [points to an underground food factory] Nuttin' holes! [tries to open the door, but is unsuccessful]
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Krabs! You're not making me happy. [gets very angry] You're making me cry! [cries] You're ruining me business. [gets a nasty look on his face] Really? I've lost it! I wonder what's up with you! [Mr. Krabs picks up SpongeBob] What in blue blazes is this?! [the growler is kicked in the stomach area and into Mr. Krabs' face; Mr. Krabs regains consciousness]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I... I don't think I feel quite sorry for what took place.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what did happen?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know anything about it and I haven't seen... uhh... the... Mr. Krabs? [walks into the kitchen, but is stalk t... [is now seen wearing a] a Krabby Patty and a Krabby Patty Double and Under the Window [giggles]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what do we do?
Mr. Krabs: What do I do? Hmmm... what do I do? [Mr. Krabs dreams about going to the Krusty Krab and comes to the Krusty Krab] I don't know. Krusty Krab? [gasps] No! Not Krusty Krab! [goes up the stairs and hears knocking on the other side of the front door; Mr. Krabs opens it but nobody was there] Hey, there's someone downstairs!
SpongeBob: [jumps down the stairs] Mr. Krabs, the cash register is on the way!
Mr. Krabs: The cash register? You built it, right where it's at?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, there's got to be a way out of here something like that. Things can't be rigged.
SpongeBob: No, not that way.
Mr. Krabs: It's a stretch, SpongeBob, but it's perhaps no surprise that you and I share a fondness for... [gets off the floor and growls] ...sticks... things. [we see a Krabby Patty, then a security guard takes SpongeBob, Squidward and Patrick and closes the door while Squidward growls] Confiscating without a license is a crime. [closes the door on the way back] Oh, Mr. Krabs, it's all starting to bother me.
Squidward: Look out, Mr. Krabs, I'm driving a boat!
Mr. Krabs: And breathing are a crime.
[cuts to later in the night. A crane drops the first half of a banner, then the entire building down in flames. The police boat drop a banner that reads "Krabby Patty" and a giant bangle fish falls to the ground. Firefighters put out the blaze, which engulfs the whole building. The smoke then goes up the elevator and into the back of the Krusty Krab. Fred comes out of the employee elevator with a tray of food]
Fred: [takes out a Krabby Patty] What a lovely meal you gave us, Fred. [takes a second Krabby Patty closer to his and his stomach growls] And
