Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, I wanna hear back from time. [closes the door]
SpongeBob: Okay. Patrick, you've had too long to read. Let's see what this hallucinogenic quarter has to say about hallucinogens.
Patrick: Uhh, good.
SpongeBob: Well, let's see... [reads the written statement] "It has been scientifically proven that hallucinogens have a wide range of uses, but which of them is more dangerous?
Patrick: Well, that's up to you. But I'm sure someone out there can tell you which one is more dangerous." [pulls out a remote]
SpongeBob: [gasps] That's right. [pushes Patrick out of the kitchen] It's all very well, Patrick, but would you look like you're still recovering from your attack? [laughs]
Patrick: Well, I feel pretty good.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think you should be talking about what you think is dangerous. [SpongeBob pushes Patrick's sunglasses off-screen] What is so scary about being blindfolded?
Patrick: Well, the thought of being blindfolded makes my skin crawl. [SpongeBob pushes his fists away] It's as if my forearms &p &p &p [has a small black eye] &p. [with a big fist] instead of giving me the correct answer. [SpongeBob pushes Patrick's shell out in front of Patrick] It's as if being in a "wall of sound" makes you sound exactly like a brick wall. [SpongeBob pushes Patrick's door back and forth] And then they'll just keep walking, just like worms. [SpongeBob pushes Patrick's shell tilts upwards]
Patrick: [his eyestalk is disturbed by his broken arm] And I don't even have a mop. [Patrick's shell tilts upwards instead of down.] Well, that's final. [grunts]
SpongeBob: [excitedly] Oh, great Neptune! I have never seen anything before in the whole deep ocean! I am so gonna go home, home-o!
Patrick: [is too far away for his shell to go off] Oh, no problem, SpongeBob, you're home already.
SpongeBob: I know-- [the shell hits Squidward's eyestalk out of head] Ow! Ow! [tries to push the shell back] Having a little trouble getting the shell to put the shell back in the ground. [tries to push the shell back] Well, it's just that this is a long one. [tries to push the shell back] Well, it's just that this is a little hard to get the shell to put it back in the ground. [Squidward tries to push the shell in the air, but can't, so he pushes the shell back in the ground]
Patrick: [walks on the shell] Hey, who's responsible for this?
SpongeBob: [starting up a fire, the shell comes out of the ground with a Krabby Patty on top of it, and start to smite the Krabby Patties with it] The name's Nellie...
Patrick: Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: And that's how one night we...
Patrick: Did you say "The Krusty Krab"? [SpongeBob smite Nighty Night with his shell while doing the same with his hat]
SpongeBob: I did. [SpongeBob then destroys the Krabby Patty with his bare hands]
Patrick: I did. [Patrick then does the same with his arms]
SpongeBob: And that's how one end of the world ends up this night. [SpongeBob then destroys a biker gang's van with his bare hands]
Patrick: [SpongeBob then destroys the Krabby Patties with his hands like this]
SpongeBob: I did. [SpongeBob then destroys the Krabby Patties with his hands like this again]
Patrick: [SpongeBob then destroys the Krabby Patties with his hands]
SpongeBob: I did. [SpongeBob then destroys the Krabby Patties with his hands like this again]
Patrick: [SpongeBob then destroys the Krabby Patties with his hands]
SpongeBob: I did. [SpongeBob then destroys the Krabby Patties with his hands like this again]
Patrick: [SpongeBob then destroys the Krabby Patties with his hands like this again]
SpongeBob: I did. [SpongeBob then destroys the Krabby Patties with his hands like this again]
Patrick: [SpongeBob then destroys the Krabby Patties
