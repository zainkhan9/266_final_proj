[The episode starts with live-action footage of icebergs, but the real footage is shown only after the episode began.]
Narrator: Ah, observe the majesty of the mighty iceberg. [scene zooms out to show iceberg in the wide shot] Follow my gaze this beautiful day begins with a panoramic panoramic view of the majestic arch of the iceberg. [scene ends] Along the way, you will experience: [scene opens up and a camera looks from a cliff up] Glorious Chum Bucket, the Chum Bucket is one the most arthritic of all the mountains.
[A clip of a snowman is shown.]
Narrator: And so, we are back in the Chum Bucket. This time, it is chock-full with live food. [chuckles] This is the life. It's almost as if the only life form that lives within this clip is that that which knows. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: [knocks on Patrick's rock] Where is everyone? Ah, is that you, Patrick?
Patrick: [knocks on SpongeBob's rock] Where is everybody? I dunno, we have ducks and a ladies room, too.
[But the two are half of the same cursed tree,] along with three other SpongeBobs!
SpongeBob: [points at the two] Why don't you just go back to sleep, Patrick? We are sworn to protect and serve, and nothing could ever hurt us! [rushes over to the couch, slamming it against him.]
Patrick: [in his bed, looking through his telescope] We need to get some sleep.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
[SpongeBob pushes his snore in, then pushes his snore in again. Patrick is asleep. Now, SpongeBob, do you wake up? Do you understand?
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick. Yes, Patrick. We need to get out of here.
[SpongeBob looks around and sees the three houses. He goes home.]
Patrick: [thinking] Huh? Oh... where is everybody? [the three are asked to walk the three houses]
SpongeBob: That's it! We are out of the Chum Bucket.
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: That's right! [they push themselves out of the Chum Bucket] Getting out of here is as easy as pulling up a Gary. [a Gary is seen hanging at a hawker's hawse. Patrick and SpongeBob pull ourselves out of the Chum Bucket. They put themselves out by pushing them through a pineapple. A giant clam jumps and starts eating them. We see a family of miniature fish sitting at a table.]
Patrick: Ahh! The mini SpongeBob version is just as I imagined. [SpongeBob pushes himself out of the Chum Bucket as he is pulling himself out of the Chum Bucket. By now, a huge line of people have filled the Chum Bucket. Patrick is still sleeping. He tries to push himself out, but he pulls himself out anyway.] Just as I imagined, I... [As he is about to say the word "no" to Patrick, the screen goes zoom out. Patrick's head is now smaller than before and SpongeBob is still sleeping in his house] Okay, you say. [digs into his house and pulls himself out]
Patrick: I'm staying in this stupid house! [shows that he is covered in dirt and cobwebs from the "House of Horror and Confusion"]
SpongeBob: [in his sleep] This is so out of control! [SpongeBob wakes up and looks out the window. He kicks some rocks and into his bed, then goes to sleep. An alarm clock "Sitters" starts going off]
Patrick: [thinking] Huh? Whoo, what is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah, I don't know, Patrick. My alarm clock is stuck in the butt hole.
Patrick: [notices the "House of Horror and confusion),"I see, you're not SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Excuse me, sir, put it away!
Patrick: Why don't you two go kick somebody else's butt? [SpongeBob starts hitting himself with rocks]
SpongeBob: That was fun. And here comes the real tough one.
Patrick: Me, too. [both start hitting themselves]
SpongeBob: Me too. [Patrick hits himself with a rock]
Patrick: Yeah, the Guy With The Scissors is too!
SpongeBob: Ha, ha! The SpongeBob Of The Month is too!
Patrick: SpongeBob Of The Month? [SpongeBob's eyes widen] SpongeBob Of The Month? [He sees Patrick hitting himself with a rock] SpongeBob Of The Month
