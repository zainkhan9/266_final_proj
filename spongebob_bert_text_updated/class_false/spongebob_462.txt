[episode starts with a view of Conch Street. Night turns into morning where birds are chirping and SpongeBob hears SpongeBob's call]
SpongeBob: [in his bed at night] Good night, Mr. Mirror. [snore]
Mr. Mirror: [Gives SpongeBob a note tied around his neck] It says, "Good night, SpongeBob." [snores off and walks to the window] And so, I spent the whole night. [a dark figure comes out]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, what's this? [reads the note] "4 more tears in the morning?"
[he jumps out of bed]
Mr. Mirror: And what do you think it is?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Why not tell the Mirror to go away?
[SpongeBob tries to say, "But..." then, the Mirror stops him]
Mirror: Don't touch me! [hits SpongeBob in the head with his small mirror]
SpongeBob: Uhh... I guess that's a fine line between...
Mirror: You're just not being professional.
SpongeBob: At least I don't have to use these fancy glass mirrors.
Mirror: I'm ready to pass you for a very good hockey player. [hits you in the head with his clean mirror]
SpongeBob: Bye, bye, bye. The mirror is the best coach there is.
Mirror: I don't want to play, I play.
SpongeBob: Bye, bye. The clean mirror is always a nice change of a cent.
Mirror: Oh, you wouldn't play that way. You wouldn't play there, would you?
SpongeBob: Neither would I. The clean-mirror was always better.
[he growls]
Mirror: Oh, yeah?
SpongeBob: [growls again]
Mirror: [annoyed] Nice game, card. Now let's play!
SpongeBob: Oh! [He runs into the dirty dishes in the distance. A scene bubbles over to Patrick where the Mirror clarifies that he is now playing a game called, "The Dirty Dance"]
Patrick: You are the center of the universe, Mirror.
Mirror: Oh, I thought you were the boring star.
Patrick: Let me do it! [He throws a tennis ball at SpongeBob. The two dance across the floor, then stop. A bubble transition happens, and then we see a face on a couch. It is Patrick's face, it reads, "Sandrine"]
Patrick's face: [Pointing to the Dirty Dance] You are the clean dancer.
Mirror: Oh, I am not the clean dancer, Mirror. I'm just the dirty dancer. [Patrick gets up and imitates the Dirty Dance]
Patrick: Nice. 
Mirror: Oh, yeah. You're the boring star. 
Patrick: Nice. 
Mirror: Oh, yeah. You're the clean dancer. 
Patrick: You're the clean dancer with the lips [The Dirty Dance mirror shows his lips, shivering].
Snapshot of day two: [cut to inside the Treedome] We pulled all the stops to get to the first choice pick in the draft. [The first pick comes out of the ruckus and he is Eugene Mirman. He turns around and sniffs the air] Ahh...Hee!
Patrick: Pick No. 3.
Mirror: No pick No. 3. 
Patrick: Pick No. 4.
Mirror: No pick No. 4. 
Patrick: Pick No. 5.
Mirror: No pick No. 5. 
[Abercrombie and Candice walk up]
Patrick: I want it!
Both: [both pick No. 5] AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
SpongeBob: [screams]
Both: [both make an unnatural bass sound] AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [screams]
Both: [They crash through the top of the treedome, and hit the sand. [Then, lightning strikes, and peaks into throught the tree, which goes through the treedome, through the pipes, and through the monkey bars. It goes through the worm holes, and is at the end of a hallway. An angry Annette walks up down the hall]
Annette: What's all the racket, Frank?
Frank: [screams]
[An
