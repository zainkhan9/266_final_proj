[Episode starts with Gary watching TV]
French Narrator: Ah, a Bikini Bottom-bound person is wandering the web of life on the edge. As he reads the headlines, he comes across the words "6 Things You Didn't Know About Fish..." [SpongeBob reads the headline while putting on his hat] ...of course, this would be a normal headline. Except that on his next page, he reads "Follow Me to my next destination." ...So, he thinks he can swim to the Krusty Krab, but actually the opposite. Shoots. He realizes that he cannot get to the cash register. Therefore, he walks as left, but then goes a few steps onto a table and falls flat on his face. The crowd was there cheering. SpongeBob began to read the newspaper as he walked to the Krusty Krab. A cash register is not a cash register. He walked to the cash register but steps on a table and falls flat on his face. He then starts splashing the register money into his mouth.]
Narrator: 48 hours later. [SpongeBob is still walking to the Krusty Krab. Hardware store hours later, tram stop and the Krusty Krab across the street; additional hours later, the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob at the front desk; and at the Krusty Krab on the phone]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. Won't do. [talks back on the phone] Sorry, Squidward. I have so many more gifts for you. Squidward? [talks again] Sorry, Squidward. I have so many more gifts for you. [cuts off at the front desk] SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
Squidward: Wait, SpongeBob, I have to go make those Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: But first, you need to make the patties for my dear friend, Squidward.
Squidward: [sarcastically] Oh, that's easy. Squidward, you've been teaching me all week. Why don't you take me away from the limousine and get me to the gift shop? Take me to the gift shop?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a great idea, Squidward! Take me to the gift shop? [laughs] How about dance with me while I go?
Squidward: Fine, but I'll stay in my seat.
SpongeBob: Thanks! Then who's going to pay for those things?
Squidward: The idiot ones! Hey, SpongeBob, I know what you want. Get it?
SpongeBob: That one... Hey, Squidward, one second! ON THE PATTIE! No, wait, SpongeBob, that's it! You can't just shove your back in the door and have fun. That um... That one is beautiful.
Squidward: And only one...
SpongeBob: ...Um. [Squidward starts laughing as SpongeBob wipes his sweat off with his hat]
Squidward: I don't want that, I don't want that. It's not yours.
SpongeBob: Sure it is!
Squidward: It's not mine!
SpongeBob: No, it's not yours!
Squidward: Yeah! [walks off and cuts to the gift shop where Squidward barges in] Look at this! [toilet gets packed in a truck; meanwhile, a lot of fish run around in circles] Come on, you big boys...
Miss Shell: Sixteen punches! That'll put down ten, no?
SpongeBob: Nuts?
Miss Shell: Nine...
SpongeBob: [screams] He's gone!
Patrick: [runs; jumps on the bed] Hey, Squidward, come on out! There's more! Ooh! Oh, look at that, fella, nobody misses a thing!
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Patrick: It means nothing.
SpongeBob: It means something more than money.
Miss Shell: I have a confession. I'm a fraud transformed into a-Averturizer.mp3 [The Bikini Bottom News starts a front-page story on the Bikini Bottom Police Department]
Plankton: [As the TV reporter walks over, showing him naked, blubbering and covered with a cloud] I am a fraud transformed into a-Averturizer.mp3 [the police department appears on the TV]
Miss Shell: Why aren't you going out selling your liege?
Police Officer: No, that's not what I said.
Plankton: Hey, come on out. I'll just sit in on it.
Police Officer: Okay.
Police Officer: [turn
