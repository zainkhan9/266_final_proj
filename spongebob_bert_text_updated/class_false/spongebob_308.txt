Patrick: [screams and runs away. Cut back to SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob! I get you! Thanks, SpongeBob! Bye! [SpongeBob opens the door, and the Flying Dutchman turns into Pearl]
Flying Dutchman: Over...
SpongeBob: Over... Go! [SpongeBob runs off, and he looks back at the Flying Dutchman, who finally stops, and starts to bow] In all my years of living as a dreary old dreary old ghost, I have never witnessed such a funeral! For instance, Mr. Krabs! [SpongeBob turns back into his normal form, and drops to the ground] I'm sorry, dreary old ghost, what happened to you?
Mr. Krabs: I killed time and distance, son. [thinking] Ah, Mr... [thinking] ...study the details. The most important fact to know about the Krusty Krab... [SpongeBob turns back into his normal form] is this: They bury you. You see all the stuff? Like a coffin, a dirt wall, a dirt wall that's always there... [thinking] ...thunder! [SpongeBob falls down revealing more graves. SpongeBob stops revealing more graves and a green ghost appears, spookingly of course]
SpongeBob: I've been here all day. I've seen all the stuff. I've even seen the ground. [SpongeBob stops appearing] Was it the ghost?
Flying Dutchman: [Goes over to the graves, then turns to SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman's coffins] Dear me! Dear me! [The Flying Dutchman turns to SpongeBob and SpongeBob starts to cry]
SpongeBob: Is it not for theâ€”
Flying Dutchman: Cut it out!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Dutchman! It's terrible!
Flying Dutchman: No, no, it's not. It's horrible! [SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman cry]
Vendor: What's wrong?
Flying Dutchman: It's horrible! There's lots of stuff on the floor!
SpongeBob: [happily] There's lots of stuff?
Flying Dutchman: Why don't you walk me through... [talking to SpongeBob] The time for quiet! [The Flying Dutchman turns around, revealing that he is instead playing a tape measure. SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman stare at the first item on the list] The attic. Okay, get it, now get it.
SpongeBob: [getting impatient] The attic?! [the Flying Dutchman suddenly squishes the item with a dust cloud] What's the deal with that cursed item?
Flying Dutchman: Well, it's probably a bit dusty on the floor.
SpongeBob: dusty? I mean... not dust! [shouts] What is that?
Flying Dutchman: dust! I don't know!
SpongeBob: [screams] No, no, wait, it's the attic.
Flying Dutchman: attic?! What the heck is going on here!?
SpongeBob: I came to haunt you, you filthy mongrel ghosts! [screams]
Flying Dutchman: No, no! I came to haunt you! You're not ghosts!
SpongeBob: Yes! I am! [Flying Dutchman growls] You should've known! [screams]
Flying Dutchman: Hey, you're yellow and scary! Huh, I got that! [throws the switch. The ghosts get out of SpongeBob's head and scare him into letting him let them go, while he laughs] Alright, yiddee! Whoo-hoo! [throws the switch. The ghosts get out of SpongeBob and scare him into letting him let them go, while he laughs] Alright, yiddee! Whoo-hoo! [throws the switch. The ghosts get out of SpongeBob and scare him into letting him let them go, while he laughs] Alright, yiddee! Whoo-hoo! [throws the switch. The ghosts get out of SpongeBob and scare him into letting him let them go] Alright, yiddee! Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: Ahh, wasn't that great, Gary? We threw the Mean Boat Rule Book at you!
Flying Dutchman: I don't know what you two are trying to do, but it's pretty ridiculous. [crying]
Judge: Ahoy!
SpongeBob: [He looks out of the window and notices Patrick and Gary] And them. And two old fish. And two clown fish. And an ice cream shop. [cuts back to Patrick and Gary] And that's how we got
