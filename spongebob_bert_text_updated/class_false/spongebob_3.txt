[The scene starts with a shot of the Krusty Krab. The scene fades to a wide shot of the restaurant. A rainbow is shown and the sign flips to a clockwise spiral. The scene then shows Mr. Krabs' anchor at night.]
Mr. Krabs: [As SpongeBob sleeps] Gee, I'm sure it won't be much of a stretch, but you have to stay awake through all the festivities. [Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob outside the restaurant. The scene changes to show a shot of the inside of the Krusty Krab where we can see SpongeBob working. It then fades to a close-up of SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: We're all out, Mr. Krabs. We're all in! [SpongeBob nods in agreement] Okay, no showing Sal's face.
[We then see Squidward sleeping. He wakes up, and he has a very sleepy expression. Harold, the window handle, and Mr. Krabs slink back into the restaurant. We see a close-up of Squidward's tired expression.]
Squidward: [As Harold gets up and leaves] You said something, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I...I don't remember it.
[We then see a very close-up of Squidward's dollar bill. Mr. Krabs rips it off and puts it in his pocket.]
SpongeBob: Well, here we go. Your liberty. [Walks past Squidward] Hm, here we go. [Walks to the bag] Our jellyfish hide. [Puts the bag in front of him] Now let's see, uh, where did you get these?
[Mr. Krabs looks at the bag in question suspiciously.]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, I didn't see anything.
[SpongeBob gasps and walks back to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs. I didn't find anything!
Mr. Krabs: Well, take me home!
SpongeBob: I left you a...barnacle?
Mr. Krabs: [While picking up the bag] That's right. All right. [Walks to SpongeBob] SpongeBob, would you mind keeping this secret?
SpongeBob: Oh, sure. Why don't we tell everybody a secret we don't want them to know? Hmm...Would I like...!
[Mr. Krabs shakes his head.]
Mr. Krabs: Then, would you care to see my trusty bank records?
SpongeBob: [While picking up the bag] I would be delighted to see what you owe me.
Mr. Krabs: Wonderful! I just want this to be all over so you can go home and play your clarinet.
SpongeBob: I don't know, [tears up] why don't?
Mr. Krabs: Wait, then. Assert yourself!
[SpongeBob pushes himself. He is now a full-grown adult, and he loves it]
Mr. Krabs: I think he's immature.
French Narrator: 7 days later...
[We now know where Mr. Krabs' house is. SpongeBob is standing on the couch, watching TV, when an ear pops out of his side.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, my house is full of earmuffs.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, me house is full of amenta.
[An ear pops out of SpongeBob's house and squirts a doorknob. The crowd cheers.]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, thank you!
[SpongeBob pushes himself and pushes himself. But his sitting starts getting him tired.]
SpongeBob: I'm trying my best.
[SpongeBob pushes himself and pushes himself. He is now tired and sweaty.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm not sitting well.
[Mr. Krabs pushes himself and pushes himself. He is now also sweaty and you can almost taste his sweat.]
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Oh!
Mr. Krabs: Hey! How come when you're sweaty, you sweat off everybody?Â [laughs]
[The crowd laughs.]
[Cut to outside.]
Mr. Krabs: Now then, is it a member of the community to make? [gets SpongeBob's money and starts to stuff him]
SpongeBob: How much is it?
Mr. Krabs: Well, it's community service.
SpongeBob: What is?
Mr. Krabs: Well, what is?
SpongeBob: What is?
Mr. Krabs: Well, what do you think it is?
