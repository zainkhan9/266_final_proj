[scene transitions to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Oh, you're here, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It's as if the Krusty Krab is the most haunted place to live.
SpongeBob: I've got a tip: don't touch Krabby Patties. [takes out his currant tip]
Mr. Krabs: [takes out a second crumbs of his own] Here's the currant tip.
[SpongeBob's handle is kicked, and spiders fly out of his body.]
SpongeBob: Oh, that's horrible. Why don't you go crawling? It's a ride with dodder, where you get to decide how the monsters run the place. [points to the spinning saw that launches Spat, into the air] That's it! [turns on the light] I can see clearly!
[SpongeBob sees a portal that leads to a twisted-away-from-the-curtain-and-on-the-ground-park. He enters the twisted-away-from-the-curtain-and-on-the-ground-park and goes through the portal. Then, SpongeBob sees a dark room with a barred window. SpongeBob screams as he enters the room, and the door opens. SpongeBob runs out of the room, and enters the darkened room. He enters the next room, and falls down. He sees two ghosts in a chair, who are pointing at him. He jumps out of the chair and into the bed, which is turned into a light-filled window, and shuts the window, ending the episode.]
