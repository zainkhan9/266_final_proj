[The episode launches every Thursday at 10:00, starting at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is filling in for Squidward outside]
SpongeBob: I bathe like a hog. [Bikini Bottomites drop dead of embarrassment.] Did that fool you again?
Squidward: [weakly] What's all the hubbub out here?
SpongeBob: [Squidward groans] I found the perfect massage oil for you. [SpongeBob drops his burger on Squidward's face.] There you are! [Squidward's face pops out of the burger.]
Squidward: Thank you! [picks up the burger with its patties in his mouth] This is the best thing about the world!
[SpongeBob walks away, but was about to reapply for a job at the Krusty Krab when a towering figure head figure 865–95’—who is actually Squidward, face a wall full of blank portraits of him and around his house and even in his pants! [coughs] Face, face, face!
[cut to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It's me first day working here, boy. What can I do you for?
SpongeBob: Just ask me.
Mr. Krabs: Well, lad?
SpongeBob: [staring at Mr. Krabs through a pair of binoculars] And what can I do you for?
Mr. Krabs: Why, me first day as fry cook. You start the year with a conscience' work, not'wr clothes. [shuts the door to SpongeBob and Squidward]
Squidward: No one can resist the sweet smell of a woman's grave.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, good one, Squidward. You've finally found your voice.
Squidward: Oh, nuho.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, listen. Two fish don't kiss the ground the same way men do. It's not so much about style as it's about principles. Remember, these rules are for the common good. And you've followed me around. Look at me. I don't stand a chance. Two common good looks apart. What's the point?You're just standing there, talking to a Squidward who's dying of thirst. And I told you, the difference is worth a gallon of oil. [SpongeBob gets another pair of Foos in his keepad]So, how do I get your name tag?
Squidward: If you'd like, you could put Squidward's name all over this place. [SpongeBob puts name tag on the kelp and the smell turns Squidward to a certain color] Or, put it all behind a plaque.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, okay.
Squidward: Whatever.
Mr. Krabs: It all makes sense once you understand why you're the only one for whom the Krusty Krab is your home.
Squidward: I'm not staying in the Krusty Krab. I'm staying here. [jumps in the Krusty Krab parking lot]I'm getting to the bottom of this. [Squidward pops out of a hole in the floor plan] And I want toow stack some more. [Squidward gets all of his money but drops it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, this is too valuable. [grabs Squidward's money and puts the name tag on it] Quit wasting your money in the Krusty Krab. [takes out his notepad] Now is it time to decide who gets the last burger?
Squidward: Who?
Mr. Krabs: You, Squidward. I think you might be in need of a new patty.
SpongeBob: Who?
Mr. Krabs: I need you to help me decision-making process. [SpongeBob hands Squidward the notepad] Now you go in, everyone.
All: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Whoa!! [SpongeBob walks in the kitchen. Squidward is #1] Hey, buddy. How's about your #1?
Squidward: Well, I don't get it. How is this a good idea?
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. My idea is really sick.
[cut to later]
Squidward: All right, all right. Let's get this over with.
Mr. Krabs: Sick? That's sick enough. Now what would you say to help me do?
SpongeBob: I would say, uh, that I am sorry to say, but I'm gonna have to
