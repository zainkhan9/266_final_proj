[At the Krusty Krab…]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No! Why, hello, customers. I'm Mr. Krabs, and we need your help getting the Krusty Krab back to the way it was.
[At SpongeBob's house, the customers are still falling out of the Krusty Krab and are talking.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello. [disguises well] New customers? I'm glad you're here, as was my usual practice. Here, let me try out your spatulas.
Dime: Hey, I used to work here.
Harold: What's wrong, guys?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, we can't—we can't! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What can I do?
Dime: Says you're hungry.

Harold: What can I do?
[SpongeBob grumbles and walks to the kitchen while bringing a plate home. He pours some of the cheese]
SpongeBob: Mmm hmm! [eating some] Cheese, tomato, lettuce, olives, ketchup. Oh! I can't think of anything! I'm too hungry!
[SpongeBob mumbles and runs off to the bathroom. Then he comes back with a plate with a bunch of patties and a glass of wine in it.]
SpongeBob: All right, I'll get you what you want! [eating some cheese, making a gourmet sauce, and pouring the cheese and tomato sauce] Boohoo! What's my favorite? Is it Krabby Patties or Patties with Tomato? I'm always hungry!
[SpongeBob looks from ear to ear in the mirror.]
Amoongone Natural King: Gastro, how are you today?
Mr. Krabs: Not too well, son. I'm outta here.
[Mr. Krabs blows the blowfish's clarinet and then makes Pappy dance in his place. Another natural king comes out of the sewer and patties in his place. He is then revealed to be the size of a small town, with one toilet, a faucet, and sink. A gourmet chef then appears and serves the customers]
Johnny: We had our moment last night, real close to the heart of our town, the humble pancake house. [Shows a plate full of patties on screen and the words "Broc"] "This" written in cursive, with 'NYCT" at the end. Pans over and puts the plate up. As Pappy exits, the screen turns black, fade back to the present, and the scene returns to the present.]
Johnny: We had our moment, here in town, too. [Pulls up bar red light, puts on green light, and exits. Ye old direction, Johnny goes up to the circular walkway. Left from front, Johnny goes up to the "Walk-In" sign. At a beat, SpongeBob is seen standing in front of the Krusty Krab W. Right from left, SpongeBob goes up to the "Ride Center" sign. At a beat, Nat Peterson is there as well. He is also wearing a Guinness shirt. He is also wearing a Guinness-themed t-shirt. He makes a grand entrance, and disappears before reappearing. The scene changes to show SpongeBob's house, which is actually opposite.] [As he is walking down a hallway, an anchor comes up. He hooks it up, and everything is looking exactly like SpongeBob's house.] [As Fred is sitting in SpongeBob's boat, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob's house, and anchor are shown simultaneously.] [As the camera zooms in on SpongeBob's house.] [Gleefully] SpongeBob's house!
