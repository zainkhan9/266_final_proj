[The scene starts with a shot of sunset.]
French Narrator: Ahh, a beautiful day for picturesynthesis. This time, I'm hiked the bikershed. There's a camera boom, and here we are a half-hour later, still photographersafe. [flashback to a camera telling the story of how the pioneers] Remember our pioneers, who multiplied into a whole people, unbeknownst to us little by little, as we go on the road, and lived by a code of conduct, rather than a caricature, rather than a caricature-like caricature, but who were, in fact, inaccurate, but who were also inaccurate in many respects. However, they be true in many respects as well. A quick survey of their thinking, skill, and even actions will be vital. What they saw, what they heard, what they thought was their most important mistake. [flashback to 1800s cartoons] What they saw, what they heard, what they thought was their most important mistake. [Flashback to present day, mobile era, French Narrator laughs] What they saw, what they heard, what they thought was their most important mistake. [Flashback to past episodes] Be they ourselves or our ancestors, we who have not seen... [Flashback to present day] Some might say it is me who created these images, but who are we to deny them? [Narrator screams] What do we do to make the images disappear? [Kelpy G stops humming] Now, this is just one example. You can come up with your own solution. I'd love to see you come up with me some gorilla you can talk to. [Kelpy G turns into a gorilla then laughs] Greetings. You are a precious gift. [Gorilla then looks down and picks up SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: ♪My name is SpongeBob SquarePants. I spent 6 years in this building. I spent 6 years here. I spent 6 more years here than at any other institution. I studied at all these different museums. I even went to Davy Jones School. I even made my own Krabby Patties. I'm so proud of you! Do you think I could stay?♪ [Gorilla begins to bark and the two go in each building each building is full of monsters. One building has a door that has two people inside. One gorilla then chomps on the door]
Gorilla: Warning, boys! [shakes an impatient SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! Wait!
Gorilla: Warning, boys! [shakes an impatient SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: No, please! Just... don't do that!
Gorilla: Warning, boys! [shakes an impatient SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [Gorilla pushes an impatient SpongeBob] Don't... breathe, SpongeBob! [Gorilla pushes SpongeBob into the chimney. SpongeBob starts to cry and groans]
Gorilla: Warning, boys! Look what you've done to me! [Gorilla zaps SpongeBob] For life! [SpongeBob now has a nose and ears that protrude from his body and a contusion in his forehead]
Lifeguard: You're imperilled!
Gorilla: LIFE GUARDIAN! You're... [all of a sudden, someone throws a basketball in SpongeBob's hands]
Lifeguard: Yes?! That was a basketball? [a hand shows up]
Gorilla: Warning, lifeguard! [Gorilla jumps onto SpongeBob as he cries]
SpongeBob: Please don't throw the basketball! I have more friends than you!
Gorilla: [sad] Goodbye!
SpongeBob: Life is too short! [Runs out of the treedome, hugging some people. Then, he comes back with a microphone and microphone operator inside]
Gorilla: It worked! You have a friend here who is much more important than public speaking. [greeting: Sir Quentin and Fabrice Rechid. Mr. Rechid gives SpongeBob a basketball]
SpongeBob: What are you, dear friend?
Gorilla: I need you to do...
SpongeBob: Do I?
Gorilla: Y... You said it! [cries more] SpongeBob, I am too sweet! It's time to end this! [throws the basketball]
