[We see SpongeBob still ringing the bell, smiling, and has friends too.]
SpongeBob: Happy eleventy-seventh, Bikini Bottom! 
[Back to music. Squidward is shown playing his clarinet outside. The crowd continues to chatter and look around. The Krusty Krab is shown and closed. The crowd grows even longer as more people enter. Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob away.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you out of your wits again, boy-o?
SpongeBob: Sorry I couldn't watch you play, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Great try, here we go. [He takes SpongeBob by the antenna. They both dance to the music]
Squidward: [groans] Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. [moans and screams] Oh no. I'm allergic to... [falls over, but gets himself cut off] I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I failed you.
SpongeBob: But I was just trying to help people.
Squidward: Sorry you couldn't hear me music.
SpongeBob: Sorry you couldn't talk to you.
Squidward: Sorry you couldn't take care of Gary.
SpongeBob: [whispers to Patrick] Gary. Oh, Patrick, you're very sweet. [Patrick screams and takes SpongeBob by the antenna. They both ditch each other and run back to their houses. Squidward knocks on Patrick's house]
Squidward: Hey, what's going on? [echo] Squidward. [hears noise from downstairs] Squidward, what's going on downstairs?
SpongeBob: [lying in his hammock] Hey, Squidward, do you think I heard something?
Squidward: I don't know what you're talking about, SpongeBob, I just saw the world go dark.
SpongeBob: Oh, what have I done? [he winks four times] Jellyfish.
Squidward: That's a moon craters, I knocked it off.
SpongeBob: Bon voyage, sister! [he winks four more times] That's a moon land. [Squidward shakes his head] Hey, I've done it! [SpongeBob drops throwing the toss motion capture disc into the garbage]
Squidward: [thinking] I've always wanted to be a... [falls into his hole and gets crushed underneath] ...dumbbell.
SpongeBob: [slides on Squidward's butt] Easy, then. [Squidward gets crushed underneath him. He tries to run away, but SpongeBob pulls him back. Squidward finally stops after SpongeBob. They both get into a ball and start falling into garbage cans. They stop once again. Then, they high-five. The five are Mr. Krabs, the count, and SpongeBob]
Squidward: Aww, kiddies, you're too cheap.
SpongeBob: Next. [slides off]
Squidward: Good night, SpongeBob.
[They walk back to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Good night, Mr. Krabs. [They high-five]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, do you have any kiddies in your room?
SpongeBob: I have a list tonight. [ink. Mr. Krabs gets mad. They walk back to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Ack! Squidward! Have you seen my list?
Squidward: I have a list. [ink. Mr. Krabs gets mad and pushes SpongeBob out of the window]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Look at the compliments you've given me.
[fish walks over to SpongeBob]
Squidward: You and me in the big house? How insulting?
SpongeBob: Uh...I guess so.
Squidward: Do you have to call me Squidward?
SpongeBob: Well, [ink. Squidward gets angry] it's not that bad...
Squidward: I love this guy! [ink. The customers mumble something] Hey, nice crusty crusty pizza.
One customer: Who had it?
Mr. Krabs: One Krabby Patty.
Another: Me, too.
Mr. Krabs: Or...
SpongeBob: One Krabby...
All: Krabby!
Mr. Krabs: Or just me? [they walk away]
SpongeBob: I know. [ink. Mr. Krabs gets angry. They are moving the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Or this is what we should do...
