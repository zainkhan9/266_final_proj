Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: How did you enjoy my previous job?
SpongeBob: I find you disgusting. Do you?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, that, that's my real hobby. I'm always looking for new means of getting at things. Like me. [walks inside his house]
SpongeBob: Good morning, K.
Mr. Krabs: How are you today?
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs,
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, all my life I've hated myself. Can't you see I'm trying to get paid?
SpongeBob: That wasn't a problem when I was in the navy. I was in the navy all my life.
Mr. Krabs: And you got into it.
SpongeBob: No, I didn't even get into it. I got my B.A. in chemistry a long time ago.
Mr. Krabs: What is that?
SpongeBob: I applied for a construction job.
Mr. Krabs: What do you want?
SpongeBob: Now get me a job.
Mr. Krabs: What job is that?
SpongeBob: I can't remember.
Mr. Krabs: Whatever you want, job done!
SpongeBob: Great! See you soon, boss.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

SpongeBob: Good day, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I just want to make sure you all get a job that is fun and safe.
SpongeBob: A job that is both safe and fun.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, you can say that.
SpongeBob: I'll let you both get a job that is both fun and safe.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, could I get a job as... um... 'surface worker'?
[The scene cuts to a Krabby Patty on a padded bed next to SpongeBob, who is playing the piano.]
SpongeBob: What's the meaning of this?
Mr. Krabs: It's all about the look, the smell, the details.
SpongeBob: And the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the mische...
Patrick: [screams] Shoot! SpongeBob, what are you doing?! I've got an award to give to your stupid snail!
SpongeBob: I'm just gonna take a nap somewhere.
Mr. Krabs: [to Mr. Krabs] Come in, Chipmunk. Can I help you?
Patrick: [saying hi to SpongeBob] Thanks, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick: [talking fast] I was thinking about getting a real snorkel.
[A taxi is driving by. SpongeBob gets pulled over by the taxi driver.]
SpongeBob: Hi, sir. Are we riding pikes?
Driver: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Well, how about playing it safe?
SpongeBob: [imitating the taxi driver] Be cautious, don't let the snorkel be?
Driver: Alright.
