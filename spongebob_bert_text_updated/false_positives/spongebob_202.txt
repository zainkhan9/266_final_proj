[At Conch Street, SpongeBob is at home quietly chewing his cocoa. He stops just then to notice Patrick]
Patrick: SpongeBob, are you there?
SpongeBob: I am!
Patrick: [Stops and peaks above water] That's the Clam Burglar! And I have to tell you something, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What?!
Patrick: Because you forgot your cocoa.
SpongeBob: I don't have a computer, I don't have a phone, and I don't even have a phone!
Patrick: Well, then, why is your computer in a box?
SpongeBob: [teary eyed] Because that's where my computer is. [Cut to Squidward outside]
Squidward: I didn't even have a phone! [screams]
Announcer for "Citizens of Bikini Bottom" - SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: "Citizens of Bikini Bottom?"
SpongeBob: No, it's not.
Squidward: I don't have a phone, I don't have a television, and I don't even have a television. Is this the town called Bikini Bottom? Or is it Bikini Bottom?
Patrick: Yeah, sure, it's a town in pink, and all its inhabitants are a crime-elite in their pathetic lives.
SpongeBob: All we have to do is pick up a phone and call the police.
Squidward: Oh, that won't do. Let's just hang in there and tell them what's going on.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, good night, Patrick.
Squidward: [on phone] Hey, Police, there's a call you can't make.
Police Officer: I'm afraid this is United Kingdom.
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run away]
SpongeBob: Oh, what use is it if the police can't see us? [cuts to the United Kingdom]  To the bottom of the Levee Board, just off the coast of Scotland.
Patrick: [screams] I have never seen such a deep fryer before!
SpongeBob: [cuts to next day] Levee board, if you'll excuse me. [cuts to United Kingdom]  And when you're good, you can take a walk. [SpongeBob takes a walk. The police stop] What about you]
[the police officer walks up to SpongeBob]
Officer: You want leeway, young man? [SpongeBob gives him a police officer hat]
SpongeBob: Yes, sir.
Officer: And you'll have to turn your license into a list of what you like and don't like. [SpongeBob turns his hat in the officer's face] Which way do you want them, boy?
SpongeBob: [heads straight for the Levee Board] Well, I don't know. [SpongeBob runs off and comes back with a police hat with an opened end. The officer opens the end with his claw and gives SpongeBob a police hat. SpongeBob runs off and comes back with a police hat. SpongeBob runs with a police hat on his head] And don't you dare take my hat for like, oh, oh, oh, oh! [he hears knocking on the door and turns around to see Patrick and Squidward lying on the floor] Squidward!
Squidward: [crying] I want my hat back!
Patrick: Well, how about if I just scream? [Squidward cries]
SpongeBob: I just wanted your to have my toenail clippers.
Police Officer: What is it?
Police Officer: You've been had!
SpongeBob: [looks at his toenails] I finally had my toenail!
Police Officer: Never have I had so many toenails?
SpongeBob: Nope.
Patrick: [sits up] Glad that's over.
Police Officer: Thank you, police officer. I guess that'll be a few days out without me.
[Police Officer leaves. SpongeBob still sad. Squidward still sad. Patrick still sad. Even though everything is fine, SpongeBob still cries]
Squidward: [still crying] Enough crying. I've had enough!
Police Officer: [gives him a police officer hat] I've had enough too.
Squidward: [still crying] I've had enough too!
Police Officer: [topped up his toenails with Gladys' initials] Gladys, you're here for the finework!
[Police Officer throws the toenails at Patrick]
