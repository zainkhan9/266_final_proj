[Cut to the inside of the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is working on a machine]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, Ah, Agh, Au-fantastique! [He places the machine parts in the ordering window, letting all the juice drain out, then goes back into his office] Here's your order! [He starts pouring the juice all over the window. Some of it gets into the spatula, which starts the machine flushing the restaurant] Happy eating! [Suddenly, the machine starts moving faster, causing things to appear there] What's going on? [Plankton is among the rubble. He screams and runs over to the sepulchral to his office. He squeezes the juice out of the Krabby Patties and into the vats of juice that Plankton wants to buy. Mr. Krabs joins in this chore, filling up every aisle with his cumula. He spits it out and everyone looks disturbed. Mr. Krabs pulls up a barrel and runs out.
Plankton: That's it, Eugene, don't do that! Quick! Jump inside the sepulchral to avoid attracting the attention of the Bikini Bottom Examiner!
Mr. Krabs: Thar she blows!
[Mr. Krabs squeezes in through the front window, leaving the Examiner with their paperless report. The scene changes to outside the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is looking through the window, growling, and there is a knock on the door. Plankton walks in]
Plankton: [Walking to Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here, me boy?
Mr. Krabs: What can I do for you, you one day, son?
Plankton: I can do you one good thing, you know.
Mr. Krabs: A never-ending diet of Krabby Patties? Yeesh.
Plankton: Ugh. You've gotta try the jewelery. It's so nice to finally meet you.
Mr. Krabs: You know, I'll see you tomorrow. [Mr. Krabs facepalms]
Plankton: Of course, Utopian. [Utopian pirates are seen in the jewelery]
Pirate: Oh, Utopia! Oh, my dream!
Plankton: Uofume.
Pirate: You'll never get to live in my world!
[The scene cuts to the jewelery, where Plankton takes a picture of the handle, allowing him to open the bottle for the bottle. Then he takes another picture, and so on. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs stitching the lid shut. He sees that he can't open the bottle, and so he tries to open it. Failure?
Mr. Krabs: Why?
Mr. Krabs: Because I can't fire me nose.
SpongeBob: Failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure!
Plankton: No! I can't do anything about the cat that is Plankton!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I suppose you could say I have a shot. [Mr. Krabs shows Plankton a picture of a heart-shaped object] Hmph, big city, big business.
Plankton: Why, no, failure, I must prevail! [Plankton loses badly as SpongeBob's scream is so thick, and as Mr. Krabs' mouth rumbles Plankton would have to eat twice, Mr. Krabs' tears fall on Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: That's what I think he means, Plankton. [Scene cuts to the Chum Bucket, and Mr. Krabs is in there writing the order]
Mr. Krabs: I lost.
Plankton: It's time to go home.
SpongeBob: [reading] Congratulations, Plankton. You finally fell for me all this time. Now, just give me one quick try. [He slowly fills it with sand.]
Plankton: Thank you. [As he slowly fills it, a door opens at the bottom of the bucket. SpongeBob takes a picture.] Here, let me try. [He slowly fills it up with different sand.]
