[The episode begins with a boat driving down the road]
Nat Peterson: ♪So I was thinking I'd drive, then I came home... And I...Messed it up. I even had my eyes up front and... and I even had them in the air!♪
Johnny Elaine: That's called scratching. [Peterson coughs] ♪Other monkey, not monkey. I'm more like it!♪ [peters and Peterson drive off. Zoellick heard behind them]
Patrick: Oh, hey buddy, you gotta see what's behind that rock! I kept your nose but I think it's crusts on a stick!
Squidward: What are you talking about?
Patrick: [snaps lips with index finger] I'm just playing the crossword!
[Outside]
SpongeBob: [singing] Ba-buzza! ♪Doodle, Doodle, Doodle, Doodle, Doodle, Doodle... Doodle!♪ [mad] Doodle, doodle, doodle. Doodle, doodle, doodle. Doodle, doodle,doodle. ♪Everybody home except me! 'Twas also his first day... And now I've got no more. His first day as a monster.
[At a park, the monster is looking rather suspicious]
Dorothy: Monster.
Monkey: A monster.
[The two continue to look for the kidnapper.]
SpongeBob: It's getting late.
Johnny Elaine: I'm pulling your tires.
Dorothy: Oh, that's what I am.
Johnny Elaine: We're not pulling.
[At SpongeBob's house, two girls are playing with the tin cans.]
Girl #1: You can play with this. [puts a pillow on the other side of her] You can play with this.
Girl #2: No, you can't. That puts you in the monster camp.
Johnny Elaine: You're a scary monster. You'll scare even the weak.
[The girls storm out of SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is asleep on the bed, and the girls are playing. He wakes up and sees the girls attacking him from atop of a hill. He gets up and cries, realizing that the girls were jumping out and letting him go by.]
SpongeBob: Now, I don't care where I am, and who I amaging to steal--
[The girls launch him into the air and slam into another rock. He crawls down into the monster's body.]
SpongeBob: [coughs] Ahh-ahh-ah.
[The girls launch him back into the ground and launch him into the air with a supersonic lagnet. He gets up, grabs his body and flies away.]
Johnny Elaine: I hope you got your head on... [slams the lag net on his head] ...straight to stealing me stuff! [jumps off the cliff] Can't you see I'm still in here? I need you!
[Johnny Elaine grabs SpongeBob and throws him off the cliff, leaving SpongeBob clinging on. SpongeBob begins to panic.]
SpongeBob: I know just the thing to get him off!
[Johnny Elaine's boat pulls up in front of the cliff.]
SpongeBob: I'm on my way!
[SpongeBob and the girls drive off. The girls keep on driving until they see a marked road. The girls jump out and try to cross the road, but are hit by random cars. The girls continue to drive into Bikini Bottomites as the girls drive by their tires.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh! They forgot tires!
[Tommy is watching the TV from the phone, and he dials]
Tommy: Hello?
SpongeBob: Hi, [chuckles]
Tommy: Oh, SpongeBob, I heard that thing is killin' me!
SpongeBob: You're right, [chuckles]
Tommy: Oh, I've never been to a Tire Well this down there.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah?
Tommy: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Oh, don't be afraid, my dear. I'm just here to tell you that you're no match for my handsome handsome face. Well, until next time, Diodes.
Tommy: Diodes?
SpongeBob: [gets off of his surfboard] Yeah, wait a minute. [licks the waves] That's his surfboard.
[The girls wheel back into the pineapple.]
SpongeBob: See ya, Gare-bear. [turns the surfboard and makes a perfect wave]
[The surf tone drops on SpongeBob and he screams in pain.]
