[The episode begins on a stormy evening. The sun goes down]
[He emerges from a pineapple frozen in time. He is wearing a time capsule hat. He is reading a newspaper, then he lifts his leg]
SpongeBob: Hmm, what are the chances that Sandy died because of an oxygen tank full of bubble soap? There's no time for presidential memorabilia! I've got to think of a card for Sandy. [puts on the "card"] Here it is. [puts on the "card"] Here it is. [puts on the "card"] Here it is. [puts a picture of herself holding her first son, Billy, which reads "Sandy" and has a bubble of soap on it.]
Sandy: You're an amazing mother!
[the card continues playing]
Sandy: First, I must send a message of thanks.
Billy: Oh, I'm sorry, Mother. [puts another card on Billy] And now, say hello to Sandy. [the card moves to Sandy about to hear a phone call]
Phone: [about to ring]
Sandy: Hey, you're supposed to say hello. [about to say hello] You're my favorite Sandy, aren't you?
Sandy: Uh, you said hello.
Phone: I don't like you strangers, out.
Sandy: Oh, but you don't like me, stranger.
Sandy: I don't care, freakshow!
[the scene cuts back to the present, with no clear shot of Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hmm, what should we do? [he hands a mop to a wannabe tinkerer] Ahem? I'll test your waters. [he begins to mop; he sees a ticking clock] Wait for me. [he races against a fence with a tank aimed at him] Wait for me. [he slips and breaks a fence by slipping on it like on a raft. The tank puts up a sign saying "Chumporium"! The crowd cheers] Oh, no! Not that pumpin' tank! [a live-action tank flips over on its back and slides down into the Chumporium] That looks dangerous. Whoa! What do you want, Sandy?
[there is a big pile of stuff on the ground. SpongeBob looks down]
SpongeBob: Sandy? 
Sandy: SpongeBob! What's the matter, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Sandy. Sorry. That's all I got. Now, here's your water helmet.
Sandy: Uhh, SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob: Whoa! [begins to put on her water helmet]
Sandy: Great job, SpongeBob! [stands on the tank and starts pushing it over the edge] Now, get in there and get us ready! [loudly beats on the tank]
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, I'm getting behind that defense... [hecks for his water helmet] ...guidance. Hmm, which one of you two is Shrinkock? [the other one is getting extra water]
Sandy: That one is get out there!
SpongeBob: [Sandy gets extra water] Sandy, wait!
Sandy: I'm getting in there! [bumps into SpongeBob] I just love this helmet! [Rainbow appears wearing the helmet and a green hat. SpongeBob gets in his mouth and starts screaming] I'm warning you, SpongeBob! Hold it right there! [throws the hat on the ground and holds it up] This green thing is extra squishy! [throws a bunch of the green stuff at SpongeBob. SpongeBob gets so scared that he just avoids the hat and the water helmet]
Sandy: Youtsucers! [SpongeBob screams again. Meanwhile, at the Treedome, the crowd is still chanting for Sandy]
Sandy: U don't want to disappoint her, Parvati. But she's got a new man on the wall. [Patrick walks up to Sandy]
Patrick: New man on the wall? [takes the helmet off of Sandy] You don't hear him around here. You must be a squirrel! [takes the helmet off of Sandy]
Sandy: That's funny. You see, Patrick, being a squirrel isn't as bad as you think. I mean, really. [thinking] Well, better get to work. [notices a sign that says "Dine in Rock in a Hole", and begins to climb down. Sandy begins to cry]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, wait! Don't come back! [Sandy is so scared and teary that she cries again]
