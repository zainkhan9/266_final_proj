[Episode starts when SpongeBob and Patrick walk into the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob has earplugs covering his ears.]
SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs. I'll catch up with you later. [walks into the kitchen] What do all these words have in common? They'reâ€¦ [hears a noise] Coffee spills. [opens the cupboard to see a cup with a label on it saying "This is a busier Krusty Krab" on it. The door closes] I can't believe that might be such a lying word! [walks out the kitchen with three coffee cups on him] Krusty Krab is full of lies, me partaking in just how full of them Krusty Krab is! Let's see what lies under those covers such that some idiot wouldn't mistake it for a restaurant. [starts digging a hole with a marker and sees a green bear with a cup on it]
SpongeBob: Uh, hey, pal. The bear's trying to say something he shouldn't say.
Plankton: Hey, hey, hey, squirrel! I found it! Way, what have you found?
SpongeBob: I've found it, pal. I'll just take it upon myself to explain. [starts carrying the cup on his back out back to the Krusty Krab] I found it a while ago, when I was working at the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: [off-screen] What's that, lad?
Plankton: It looks like you forgot some vanilla.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, come on now, that's a heavy for your mind!
Plankton: You roller coaster! That's what?
Mr. Krabs: That's right, I'm Mr. Krabs! [both start growling] I can smell his genius when I see him!
SpongeBob: So, it was your wig years ago that finally brought you these unibrow eyelashes?
Mr. Krabs: And this is your first hint of trouble over the wig.
SpongeBob: Look, boys, I got a date for you! [the boat drives off] Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm- [Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob by the collar. The ship is about to hit the road] What do we do now?
Mr. Krabs: What now? I'm not going anywhere.
SpongeBob: We need to do a lot more than just stand there?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, you're gigantic.
SpongeBob: Really? Really big?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Really big? Ooh. Whee! [Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob to the front of the boat. But SpongeBob gets impatient] Can you do it? Can ya?
Mr. Krabs: Can ya? Sure, pal. Can ya? Sure. Can ya? Whee! [the boat drives off. SpongeBob is very confused, he usually sits up on his chair and takes a deep breath, then solves his problems in a manner that makes sense]
SpongeBob: [as puzzle] Why am I so frustrated? I'm not trying to solve my problems. [suddenly sitting up is easy enough] I should know better, SpongeBob, I've helped hundreds of customers over the years by doing...I've seen pictures, I should have something up andable! [SpongeBob's mind goes blank] I could have anything you want!! [cut to SpongeBob doing the A-ok hands on] How about: Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob, until my robot hand becomes a realistic claw, and you have no idea what you're doing! [SpongeBob starts walking, he makes a wide shot of Mr. Krabs clothes] Don't be long. [Mr. Krabs walks off and SpongeBob finally stops, scared] Mr. Krabs? Oh, hello, Mr. K. You can't stay mad at me. That's madness! [Mr. Krabs walks SpongeBob back to his house] Careful, Mr. Krabs. You know what I mean.
[cut to the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is flipping patties]
SpongeBob: You're right! Bacons! I'm sorry, Krabs. [tapes back the box] Here it is.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's important. Make sure you wrap it. I've got a customer in his room.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry.
