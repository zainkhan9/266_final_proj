Debbie: Oh, hello. I'm Tina.
Old Lady: What are you, invertebrates about?
Debbie: Hi, Debbie.
Old Lady: Here in Bikini Bottom, the plankton subspecies act as a bridge too far for the majority. Only a little over fifty percent.

Daughter 1: Whoa!
Debbie: Not my age!
[Old lady throws the baby into the car while Debbie and Old Lady growls. The baby gets out of the car and slams into the wall.]

Mable/Monica: Don't mind me, SpongeBob, I'm busy.
SpongeBob: Mable, can't you see Mable-Mable? I need to go have a chat. [she and Mable leave the kitchen]
Mable/Monica: Oh, please don't make me bring a whole boatload of dangerous germs to Bikini Bottom. If you must know, I need my snail so I must charm it. [SpongeBob is using a lollipop as he drives his boat. he makes love to it then throws it at the dirty machine. It spins around then hits Mable-Mable with the lollipop.

SpongeBob: Aw, it's late, you young gents. What do you say Mr. Barg'n Mart?
Mable/Monica: We were about to have an old man's funeral.
SpongeBob: [jumps in the air] Hey, you older ones to celebrate?
