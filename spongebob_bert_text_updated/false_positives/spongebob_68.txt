[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to work. SpongeBob is laying on the ground, while Patrick is knitting]
SpongeBob: Wish you could've hired me.
Patrick: Yeah, I could use a little help. [SpongeBob slaps him] How about this? [SpongeBob gets off of Patrick] Ugh, this is a terrible pile of cobwebs.
SpongeBob: I've got to get up and get my hat off.
Patrick: What can you say?
SpongeBob: I can't think of a hat-related issue right now. But I do have a hat problem. [rubs his head]
Patrick: Say, hat-head, you have to leave.
SpongeBob: I can't.
Patrick: Maybe you should ask a really fine fish like me. I'm a paleontologist, and I know just underwater where to look. [looks for his hat]
SpongeBob: Are you saying I have the answer-- SpongeBob?
Patrick: No, you don't have the answer. You don't have the hat-flute-thriller-skate-skate-skate, you don't have the hat-hippie-sausage-skillet-and-the-return-a-special-television-insult-the-good old world!
SpongeBob: Are you crazy? You actually do exist? Well, there's nothing wrong with being yourself. [sadly] Where is it? Aren't you glad we could finally work something out?
Squidward: [walks to the window] I was never a fan of your before and I'm glad we got to know each other. So, here's our little slice of the big brotherhood. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That's right. [shivering] I was afraid you were, um, You know, The SquarePants.
Squidward: Where was I? [gets in the car and screams] What are you doing!? You were never gonna- [screams] You are the, the brotherhood! [throws the keys back in the car and drives off]
SpongeBob: Well, the, the.
Patrick: Oh. [sees the keys. Grabs them and gives SpongeBob a pair of socks] Oh.
SpongeBob: I was never gonna see you there.
Patrick: That was so great, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You were gonna see me?
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Well, I don't need you! What do you think you're, huh?
Patrick: Got it!
SpongeBob: I don't know, buddy. Something tells me you want some ice.
Patrick: Um... ice?
SpongeBob: I don't know how, uh... I don't think so.
Patrick: Well, let's go talk to Sandy.
SpongeBob: Okay. [both run into the treedome] Sandy, you gotta get on with it!
[cut to later]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! Sandy!
Sandy: [offscreen] Uh...give me that?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Sandy!
Sandy: [offscreen] Uh...give me that?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi...HHH!
Sandy: [alarmed] What the...? [the treedome falls down]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait! Wah!
Patrick: Wah! [crashes into a smaller treedome and is sent flying into Sandy's picnic table. She gets up and sulks away in the dining area, the ceiling cracks and falls down onto SpongeBob and Patrick, knocking over the table and the table legs, leading the young couple and the entire scene changes starts again.]
SpongeBob: Are we gonna end this with a people's tears or are we?
Patrick: Don't matter.
SpongeBob: Now that we've made good friends, we're really chemistry.
Patrick: Now that we've created true love, we're really living the dream.
SpongeBob: Hey! Who lives?
Patrick: What? [points to live SpongeBob] I'm Live! SpongeBob! [louder] SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: That's the question!
Patrick: Will that come in later today?
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, that's it! It's Patrick!
Patrick: Yeah! Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Can I be part of this thing?
SpongeBob: Sure!
Patrick: Anything else?
