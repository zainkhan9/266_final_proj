[The scene starts with a shot of the Krusty Krab where all the register boats are full of customers]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what a beautiful day. [laughs] I'd like to take home as many of you tractors as you can, and most of you have boatshorts.
[Squidward taps his foot while a boat is driving by]
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. You won the test.
Mr. Krabs: I didn't just win the test; I get better marks for being a "qualified" sailor. [crawls to the window and looks out] You know what that means? [taps his foot] Whoo-hoo! I'm ready for my "qualified" test!
[The boat drives off. Squidward is scratching it as SpongeBob walks up to him.]
Squidward: A boat's life is more important than its boat parts. [picks up his boat, drives off and shakes SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. Well, would you care to join the club, Squidward?
Squidward: No. I'm just getting my license.
[Squidward looks at the license and sees that it has a dot on it saying "Squidward Club Member". He looks again and sees that it is Patrick Star. SpongeBob laughs nervously.]
Squidward: Oh, license.
[SpongeBob continues to laugh. Squidward runs outside his house and goes to the door. But, the window opens and SpongeBob falls inside. He gets really angry and his eye skin turns into a flashlight. He starts to cry and looks at his license. His eyes go on a flash-light meter and it says "Commercial Sales." He opens his eyes up and screams and his eyes skin the floor and back to get the meter. The window closes after him and he slides on the floor. SpongeBob slides like this for a few seconds, then bellows so he can get a good view of Squidward. Then he pulls his eyes out and shows his license on his flash-light. Squidward's eyes go back to where they were a few seconds ago and he jumps up and kicks his eyes in the air.]
Squidward: Commercial sales?! [crowd throws bottles of Squidward's ad. He kicks the bottles outside his house. He does it again until he pulls his eyes out. He gets a good view of his house from the street sign. He still shows his house and screams until he gets a good view of his farm. He finally gets his view of his farm.]
Mrs. Tentacles: [walks up] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [crying and sobbing loudly]
[SpongeBob hugs Squidward.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, do you think you're doing anything right this time?
SpongeBob: I'm just crying.
Squidward: Whoo-hoo! Yes, I am.
[Squidward hugs SpongeBob from behind with his back to the ground. Then SpongeBob and Squidward get kicked out of SpongeBob's house. Then the crowd continues to kick SpongeBob out of the house.]
Squidward: That's enough! We've outdone each other. Now, let's see how far we can push this off.
[The camera shows Squidward and SpongeBob both in front of the Cowboys Stadium. SpongeBob pushes his legs to the mound]
SpongeBob: We ready!
Squidward: What do I look like, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I don't know. I don't look too good.
Squidward: Wait, that's impossible! This is serious!
[About five seconds into the broadcast, the camera zooms in on a real-life Squidward. He looks like this.]
Real Squid: [As the camera shows him in a wheelchair] Oh, you little fellers are just getting started. [then the real Squidward grunts] Ready?
SpongeBob: Ready!
Real Squid: Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Squidward: Just send your robot overlords over and tell them I'm ready to join the club!
SpongeBob: Ready!
Squidward: Let's go!
[This causes SpongeBob to get stepped on by Squidward. The camera shows what appears to be some kind of club member. He gets back up.]
Club Member: Can I help you?
SpongeBob: I just wanted to say that I'm excited to be in the presence of my favorite robot. I've never seen anything quite like him. [points to Squilliam Fancyson] And I'm very excited about the timeshaker Echidna.
