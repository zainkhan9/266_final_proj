SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Huh? [Squidward's eye twitches and zooms out. SpongeBob sees something behind his back] Squidward! Squidward? 
Squidward: Where are you?
SpongeBob: I'm over at the Kruger Krab. He's open for business.
Squidward: He ran up there after you. He wanted to wrestle. Huh? [SpongeBob's left eye glistens. SpongeBob, still wearing his karate gear, walks into the kitchen] SpongeBob, what's happened to my karate?
SpongeBob: I lost my karate belt and I'm getting new ones.
Squidward: I don't get it. Your old belt is all gone.
SpongeBob: Yes, but Squidward said I could lose it.
Squidward: Are you crazy? You keep your old belt but I'm trying to start getting my new ones.
SpongeBob: Yes, I do.
Squidward: I don't care what you say. Kick it into high gear! [SpongeBob is pushing dirt toward Squidward's house and kicks it] Kick it into high gear! [grunts as he pushes it] Oh, angles are important.
SpongeBob: Yeah, angles are important. [pushes dirt mound in the sky] Land use expert. [cuts to Squidward planting a flower] Well, Squidward, [crickets with blue notes] you have been here awhile. Why don't you take a peek?
Squidward: Blue is my favorite color.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, can you talk about why you like blue?
Squidward: Blue is a wonderful color. [laughing]
SpongeBob: Oh, great. [Squidward starts laughing] Because I like to play it off-key.
Squidward: [laughing]
SpongeBob: [dressed as a pirate] Welcome to my weekly jig-a-boating jig-a-doo! Let me demonstrate the wonderful qualities you possess. [Squidward walks away] Hmm...um...um...

SpongeBob: I don't get it. [Squidward is being shocked]
Squidward: I've been interested in your opinion, SpongeBob. Is there one company that I don't quite understand?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, I've been here thirty minutes!
Squidward: [shocked] What? [gasps] You don't understand! [SpongeBob looks at computers as if they are his imaginary company] I can't understand! [SpongeBob goes to the bathroom and puts on sunglasses] Well, I'm sorry to waste my time, Lieutenant. I have a headache keeping up my average mug of tea with masticatin. [SpongeBob whimpers] How can you spend money like that?! [walks to his desk] You are spending your brain time! [SpongeBob whimpers] Oh, I just wanted to say that I'm... [walks to SpongeBob's desk. SpongeBob whinning and banging his head] ...very angry!
Squidward: [angry] What are you so upset about?! [SpongeBob looks at Squidward] You're attacking his head.
SpongeBob: Well, that's not so bad. [Squidward looks at massage therapist]
M.N.Help: Need a new head?
Suzy Fish: Need a new massage chair?
Suzy Fish: Can I change your mind?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
M.N.Help: Need some help with my date yet?
Suzy Fish: You mean for us. [Suzy Fish gives SpongeBob his date looks like her husband Tom Punchbowl looks]
SpongeBob: Looking good, Judy! [gets in Suzy's boat and drives away] Oh, please, please, no, wait! Suzy, catch! [jumps into her seat. He jumps onto the back of Suzy's platter and drives away. Police sirens are heard]
