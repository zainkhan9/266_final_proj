[Scene cuts to SpongeBob, Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward outside the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Is there a problem? 
Sandy: You mean you don't have a supervillain board?
Squidward: Hey! You used my lunch break to sign my waiver!
SpongeBob: I'm not a supervillain board member!
[SpongeBob, Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward sit in the freezer as the clock spins.]
Sandy: We're here to sign... my waiver.
[Squidward tears up his work waiver. He looks at his work waiver and shrieks upANOTHER GRAND RARITY! died down!]
Squidward: [screams] My bad!
Patrick: Hey! My waiver!
Sandy: Then we can't just sign my waiver!
Squidward: Oh! Oh! Oh! What are you talking— you talk to my waiver!
Patrick: Well, I don't have a waiver!
Sandy: Oh, that's where I sign my work waiver!
[Patrick rips his work waiver and walks off. The camera stops at this point and we see SpongeBob and Sandy.]
Sandy: Here's where my work waiver gets us.
SpongeBob: Hey! waivers! work!
[Sandy slaps him.]
Sandy: Oh, gracious! What a silly misunderstanding. I now sit as agent for Mr. Krabs.
[SpongeBob falls down angry.]
SpongeBob: Oh, come on! What do I do?
Sandy: You don't have to do anything, SpongeBob. You can do what needs to be done.
SpongeBob: But how?
Sandy: Well, if you're going to be here, you got to be with me.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Sandy. [pulls out his work pants] work pants.
Sandy: Well, I'm a little confused. [laughs] Why don't you just sign my work pants?
SpongeBob: I—I—My wa— wa?
Sandy: Oh, that's a hat. I never got a hat until this whole "My Wa—hole Wrote It" thing began.
SpongeBob: Gee, Sandy, with your hat, I think you should consider accepting my waivers.
Sandy: I can't accept your waivers.
[Sandy makes an offer. She represents herself as being in her "KK" band.]
Sandy: I'll do your hair, dude.
[Suddenly, the doorbell rings.]
Sandy: What's your boss saying?
Worker: W-w-w-wait a minute.
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs with work boots on SpongeBob and Squidward. Mr. Krabs gives Squidward his "fit of choice." Squidward his "skin-flinting." They give Mr. Krabs their fezzes and go back to work. Squidward's belly laughs.]
Squidward: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, Squidward sideburns. We must agree that for our services, ye old' best not bother ye old man's club while ye're at it.
[Squidward blows a so called "lip-synnglass" of himself and SpongeBob and does his "lip-synnglass" over and over. Then he does his "lip-n-lip" over and over. Then he does his "lip-n-lip" over and over. Then he does his "lip-n-lip" over and over. Then he does his "lip-n-lip" over and over. Finally, Mr. Krabs lifts Squidward up.]
Squidward: Okay.
[The scene changes to Squidward reporting to the Krusty Krab for an illness. Mr. Krabs brings him a plate full of ice cream.]
Squidward: I got ice cream all alone.
Mr. Krabs: Just call me Squidward. [laughs] Or Squidward. [sticks out his tongue and laughs]
[The ice cream melts and SpongeBob is left with a small tooth. SpongeBob goes to take a sample and Mr. Krabs brings out a plate with it.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, your tooth's gone!
SpongeBob: I don't belong here. [groans]
Mr. Krabs: It's not like that, son. It's not like that. It's like this. [gasps] Never mind! I think I belong here!
SpongeBob: I don't even belong here! Mr. Krabs, I belong here!
