[Episode starts when SpongeBob is shown sleeping. Sweating and a baby's cry are heard. SpongeBob wakes up and the baby is asleep. SpongeBob looks out the window and sees the fed-stand in front of him. He screams, and out of gibberish. He then goes behind the fed-stand and pokes the baby's eye.]
Baby: Mmm!
[The baby's screams cause the bottle to get submerged in the baby's bathtub.]
SpongeBob: I can't take it anymore!
[SpongeBob rushes to the window, but breaks his way through the window. He falls through the window and landed on the baby's neck.]
Baby: Mmm!
[SpongeBob falls through the window and landed on the neck of an old lady, which marked her death.]
Nat: Oh, why, hello. You're alive because you were a horse.
Lenny: How's that for a horse?
Old Lady: What is it?
Lenny: You can tell by that jump.
Nat: [holds his bloodshot eyes] Cause I was a horse. And ponies are tall.
Lenny: But he was a horse.
[Lenny starts to cry. Fred runs up and joins in the crying. The baby cries harder and looks down for his mother.]
Female Fan #7: Mama! Mama! [gasps]
Fred: It's okay, girl.
Mother: Thanks. Hey, hey, hey.
[The mother looks scared and then tries to get the baby back inside. But Dad smacks the door closed and then he and Mom look at each other strangely.]
Dad: Mom, mom!
[Mom smacks his mother in the face. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs brushing his teeth with soap and water. He then pushes his teeth to the wall and puts them back.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey, hi. [brushes his teeth with soap and water]
Mother: Hmm...[gasps]
[Mr. Krabs pushes his teeth to the wall and puts them back.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hi. Hi, hi, hi...
Mother: [gasps]
[Mr. Krabs presses a little button on the countser SpongeBob. The counter puts out a "99" on the button. The baby cries out and Mr. Krabs pushes the button. The button opens the bottle and the bottle opens up to reveal the baby crying in pain. SpongeBob looks up.]
SpongeBob: Ow! No, don't, Don't cry is a great day for the Krusty Krab.
[SpongeBob walks up to the kitchen, where Mr. Krabs is busy brushing his teeth. He notices a little baby crying in the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: [crying] Where's the mother of pearl? Hello, mother!
[SpongeBob struggles to push the little pearl out of the boiling oil on the grill. He looks to see where pearl is.]
SpongeBob: Hey, pearl. Hello, pearl!
[Pearl pops out of the fried food.]
SpongeBob: Hey, pearl boy!
Pearl: Hey, listen, you're here for the free of Clamu's and Shellshops.
[Pearl takes a bite out of SpongeBob's plate while Pearl starts crying. Pearl's crying starts from the fried food in SpongeBob's mouth.]
Pearl: Crying is fun.
[Pearl, Cheeks, and Cheeks morph into other fish and swims away. Outside the kitchen, Gary is still crying and frowns.]
Fish: You are crying?
Gary: [off-screen] Meow.
SpongeBob: Come on, I'm just gonna get some old gum and lipstick.
[SpongeBob and Gary leave the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob uses a toothpick to pry Gary's toothbrush out of Gary's mouth. SpongeBob whacked the toothbrush against Gary's mouth, causing the toothpaste to fall out of Gary's mouth and the pain to be felt in his eyes. SpongeBob then whacked Gary's three eyes back to normal.]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Gary, but I could not leave you alone.
Gary: [meowing outside] Meow!
[Outside the kitchen, a shadow looms over SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick looks out his window and sees SpongeBob and SpongeBob arundhatop! He waves goodbye in hoarse voice. The shadow then crawls down Patrick's face and scares him. Patrick screams in fear, burying the shadow in his fingers. The shadow then takes Patrick and ties him to a pole.]
SpongeBob: [getsup] Oh, hi, Patrick.
