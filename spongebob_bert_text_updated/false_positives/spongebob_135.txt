[episode starts with Squidward planting. He climbs up some tall, succulent vines. He dances along and sings to himself. He twirls around and twirls around... ohh. He rolls around and looks up at Gary. Gary is now a Tree Dome member.]
Gary: [weakly] Meow hoo-wha?
[SpongeBob twirls around Patrick's house as Squidward dances around. Gary flies out of one of the tall vines and lands on Squidward's head.]
Squidward: [wakes up] Huh? [growls and looks down] What theâ€”!? [stops dancing] Squidward, are you okay? [Squidward growls and yelps] What is wrong with you people? Ah! My garden's been a mess! Squidward's a fraud! [screams and runs back into bed] They should've zapped him! [runs to the TV and pulls it off. Then, comes out and sees Squidward screaming and whimpering. He runs into the bathroom and climbs onto a long, yellow root can. He then grabs the can, opens it and pulls out a long string. He thenuses it to mail a letter to Squidward. Squidward starts writing, but is stopped by an annoyed Patrick. He then picks the letter up andis shown. He thenuses it and puts it in the letterbox. Three angry fish look up at this.]
Squidward: I can't believe you boys hate me... [cut to the Krusty Krab. The angry fish walks up to SpongeBob. SpongeBob walks up to Squidward.]
Squidward: Did you see that?! [Squidward facepalms]
SpongeBob: Squidward, did you see that?!
Squidward: [Screams] They hate me! They hate me!!!
[Cut to the Chum Bucket, where Plankton is. The customers are uproariously in anger.]
Plankton: You will not get this Krabby Patty with a bag of potatoes! [cries]
Patrick: [slowly] Krusty Krab...now who's that bag?
[Squidward whimpers. SpongeBob pokes his head out of the angry customers. He continues, "You will not get this Krabby Patty with a bag of potatoes.". He runs off. Patrick and SpongeBob continue. Finally, Squidward grabs one of SpongeBob's feet and starts doing pushups with it. He jumps up on top of him and does a karate yell. He regains his balance, and then he does the same. He runs off. SpongeBob jumps in and does the same. Squidward becomes dizzy.] [Walking out of the Chum Bucket] I can't do this. [Walks over to SpongeBob] If I were you I probably wouldn't be here.
SpongeBob: [escaped] You? [Patrick sighs]
Patrick: [escaped] No. How can I help you? [Walks away] You...don't understand.
[Patrick grabs SpongeBob's foot and uses it as a sock. He does a karate yell and then does the same. He runs off. SpongeBob jumps in and does the same while wrapping his arms.]
SpongeBob: No, Squidward! [Squidward falls over and SpongeBob stops moving]
Squidward: SpongeBob? What are you here for!?
SpongeBob: I brought Krabby Patties.
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, this is your last chance. And I won't let you do this.
SpongeBob: Krabby Patties?
[Patrick walks up with an anchor and Squidward hangs up the phone. SpongeBob hangs up the phone also.]
Patrick: Hang up, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, that's just a stupid phone. [SpongeBob gets up from his chair] I brought all my Krabby Patties. Did you enjoy the surprise party, Squidward?
Squidward: Well, the surprise party was very nice, but now I'm scared.
Patrick: Oh, anything but that, for the love of Neptune. [the shadow of SpongeBob begins to grow over Squidward. It turns to a painting that shows the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: That's the Krusty Krab, man. That was the most beautiful night I ever remember. I'm gonna go-back and paint it all back. [painting a boat mobile with the words "Bikini Bottom" above it. Then he goes back to painting. The night turns to morning where Squidward is sleeping and SpongeBob is in his bed, staring at him, yawning]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward!
