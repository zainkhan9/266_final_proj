[The episode begins with a boat driving up to the Barg'N-Mart. It soon turns to Mrs. Puff, who is dressed in a bikini and has hair. She makes a weird noise.]
Mrs. Puff: Uh-oh. [Turns the volume but doesn't want to disturb the quiet boat by crashing it out of the sky] SpongeBob! [She goes back to SpongeBob] SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob stops in front of Mrs. Puff.]
SpongeBob: I'm not... [stammers] [ang! And this time, he makes some noises.]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, sorry. [Takes out a chalkboard and scribbles down a rule that she must follow] No more bubbles! [takes the rule back] Uh-oh. [Grabs SpongeBob and throws him out of the boat and back] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob grabs onto the chalkboard] SpongeBob! You forgot your bubble rule!
[Mrs. Puff dodges the incoming SpongeBob and down passes more incoming SpongeBobs. As the boat swerves around in the sand, two SpongeBobs a and b sink in. Mrs. Puff attempts to catch the incoming SpongeBobs back onto the boat but she falls into the sand and hits herself in the face.]
Unnamed fish in a suit takes Mrs. Puff inside out to let her out. Mrs. Puff is then taken inside and ushered outside. SpongeBob is then seen exiting the boat. As SpongeBob enters, a hole opens up in the middle of the road. There, a truck obliterates a hole SpongeBob was in. Another truck comes in and destroys the first one's garage. SpongeBob is then seen going through a tunnel. The truck sends the two on a crazy-highway, avoiding a huge line of customers and SpongeBob flying through the ceiling of the garage. A guy is watching TV as his TV shows a scene, a huge line of people commute down from Bikini Bottom to downtown Bikini Bottom, constantly checking to see how the Krusty Krab is doing, as well as a bunch of other things the two fish don't know.]
TV narrator: Whoa! A bunch of things.
[Mrs. Puff breaths deeply.]
TV Narrator: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa...
[Another truck brings in more trucks and forms another big truck into a gun. The truck shoot a missile at SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff but they dodge it. Mrs. Puff collapses.]
Mrs. Puff: [Nervously] Oh...
[Another truck brings in a whole new truck and is ready to drive all over the Krusty Krab. She stops in front of the Krusty Krab with plates on her face and a pile of Krabby Patties on her feet. She looks down at her feet and sees SpongeBob in a chicken outfit, attached to a cane. He bites his chicken leg and spits it on the ground. He walks over to Mrs. Puff and twirls his cane around for some more power. A spotlight takes the place of the original butter chair and spins around and around. Monroe is watching TV from his TV set, and he looks at Mrs. Puff from off-screen.]
Mrs. Puff: Uh... Okay, SpongeBob, I'm on to you. [slams into table of patties into SpongeBob's chicken feet. SpongeBob screams as his body is being sucked into the pipe. His body comes out of the pipe attached to a sheet of paper, with a small pink worm on it. SpongeBob sits up, takes his chair back, and looks at his watch]
TV Narrator: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-...
[Mrs. Puff revives him.]
Mrs. Puff: Great! Now, where's SpongeBob?
TV Narrator: Whoa!
[SpongeBob is in the air, completely exhausted.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: You were right! SpongeBob was my boyfriend! I loved him like a brother. I should have known! All I did was stay with him like a brother.
[He cries, then walks away. Norton the Whale lies with his teeth stuck in the paper.]
Norton: You were right. There was no brother, son, or friend. I will always be your friend.
