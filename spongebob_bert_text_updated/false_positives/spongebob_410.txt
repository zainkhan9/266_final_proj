[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to work.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. I'm tired.
Patrick: What’s the matter?
SpongeBob: Can I have a raise?
Patrick: You can have raise, won't you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: We’re going to need each other, don't you think?
Patrick: Yes. [his eyestalk follows them]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I need you to do this. [takes the pencil and draws a line on it] There, drawn. I will go there. Keep a lookout and stay away from the window. [draws a red circle and lines up the points with his fingers] Stay away from the window. Stay away from the window. That's it. Keep looking. You'll see there's more we can do. We've got to do several things.
Patrick: I'm gonna draw a shortcut. [draws a sharp point and draws a vanshә and the pencil sharpens]
SpongeBob: How's this, Patrick?
Patrick: Digging in more gold.
[They go outside to find everything empty.]
Both: Yeah. Good enough.
Patrick: I think I can make a run for it. [He draws a curvy road and they draw precipitous slabs]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're not making any progress. Are you?
Patrick: Definitely. [SpongeBob draws a sternum stance and they draw images of fear and loincloth. They both burrow into their butt and begin to draw comic books as they read. A sailor comes comes and helps them]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you can't help but be inspired by a new culture. Be that which you like, it's time to join that new culture. [he mops it and draws images of sushi and bacon. SpongeBob and Patrick sigh in relief. A cave man comes and sees what was done. He joins the culture]
Sailor #1: Welcome to the new culture. May I remind you of the order?
Sailor #2: We do not wear sashes or buns or a "Shoe Toe" or a "Bottom Toe" or even a "Stinky Sponge." And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to shave you off later.
Sailor #1: Later. [shaves the sand off the mountain and with it] Satisfied?
[Patrick comes out of the culture and he has a brown wig with the "Bottom Toe" on it. He then goes into the wig while shaving him]
Patrick: Ah, that's most new. Uh huh!
SpongeBob: I still don't understand why you're shaving everything, but it's so pretty and beautiful.
Patrick: I'd love to hear it! [they start to battle, until a mussel with a jar of ketchup pops out]Mussel! Take that! [shaves another mussel that comes out] And those of you with shaved heads out there! Let's go see that! [the mussel eats the jar and mussel falls into the dumpster, where SpongeBob and Patrick start to cry&#31;;;;;]
French Narrator: Meanwhile... 
SpongeBob: Oh, how sweet and true is he... 
Patrick: That was awful! No! What was that?!? [sobs and cries] What am I doing?! [Patrick stops sobbing] That's right. I am tired and my head is pounding.
SpongeBob: What is it, Patrick?
Patrick: I just wanted you to stop hurting me.
SpongeBob: No, don't hurt me. You are the culture.
Patrick: Then we can go!
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, I can't. I really am hurting my bottom.
Patrick: Bottom?
SpongeBob: Bottom, it is.
Patrick: Well, if it isn't your bed...
SpongeBob: Bottom?
Patrick: I can't take it. My bottom. [Patrick tries to push his bottom]
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, you can't take it. [Patrick hits his bottom] It's all your fault!
Patrick: Well, I don't know why, but it's getting pretty exhausting.
SpongeBob: I'm just gonna run the place over. [runs onto the road, causing a hole to the road behind him]
Patrick: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
SpongeBob: Hey, what missed your turn?
Patrick: I don't really have time to run anymore.
SpongeBob: [running fast] How fast do you wanna go?
