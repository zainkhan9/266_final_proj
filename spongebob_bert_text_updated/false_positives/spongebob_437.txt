SpongeBob: [turns his body around] Huh? [his face turns back to normal after he turned back into a SpongeBob] Doh, c'mon, let's get that hat! [walks off]
[Plankton walks up to Plankton. Plankton has a [Point Pleasant] nose like regular people do.
Plankton: Oh, hey, what're you all doing out here?
[Point Pleasant woman takes SpongeBob and Squidward away]
Plankton: Look, Tiny. I brought you something special. [Holds up blanket and gives one to SpongeBob] It's actually not that bad.
Squidward: It's- it's, is it?
Plankton: Oh, come on now. You're supposed to be careful. This is a work in progress.
Squidward: This is all great, then stop you! [Scene cuts to the point and hide SpongeBob] You look like a different person.
Plankton: Now I get it.
Squidward: [Frowns] Look at me. I'm a different person.
Plankton: That's not what you think. Look at me, I'm a big girl.
[Closer up at Squidward's mouth]
Squidward: [Gasps] Oh, shrimp. My ears! All these women are impostors!
[Scene cuts to Plankton in the whale suit]
Plankton: And now I'm a monster.
[Scene cuts to Squidward]
Squidward: [Worried] Oh, hello. You. I'm... [Ominous scene cuts to a Sailor] Oh, oh! I'm sorry to interrupt your time, Sailor. My assignment: to steal a hat that was supposedly my own. [Scene cuts to the Sailor on a Trampoline] What are you worried about, hat-snatcher Squidward?
Squidward: I'm worried that you will steal something you mightn't want.
Plankton: Look, sailor! my assignment!
Sailor #3: Misery #1: Come on, come on, steal!
SpongeBob: Uh, hey, sir.
Sailor #3: Sailor, come on, come on!
SpongeBob: Uh, hey, sir. I don't think you'll need this.
Sailor #3: Misery, come on, come on, steal!
SpongeBob: Uh, hey, sir. I don't... [Ominous scene cuts to a Robot]
Sailor #3: Automated, come on, try it.
SpongeBob: Uh, hello. I'm Bikini Bottom's most wanted Robot.
Sailor #3: Automated, come on, try it.
SpongeBob: Hey, hello. I'm SpongeBob. I'm here to check in on my stolen hat.
Sailor #3: Hat, this hat is my...
SpongeBob: What? What?! No no no no no no no no. Come on, come on, Robot!
Sailor #3: Hat, this hat is your...
SpongeBob: What?! No no no no no no no no no. Okay, okay, okay, I'll play along. I think you'd be smart too.
Sailor #3: Okay, okay. Okay. I'll go get the hat. [But SpongeBob is gone. Cut to Sandy picking up her hat]
Sandy: SpongeBob! You stole my hat!
SpongeBob: [Nervously] Uh, hey, Sandy. You alright?
Sandy: Sorry, SpongeBob. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry you've been so awesome. I know you're just borrowing my hat from Sandy because it's a birthday party, you know? This is a birthday party for your friend, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: A birthday party?
Sandy: It's a party for Squidward and I'm, like, parents. You know, we're expecting pretty darn well anyone who comes to our house to be treated fairly.
SpongeBob: Mother of pearl!
Sandy: Well, if it turns out that you're actually Sandy's mother, there's no reason to be upset. Look, SpongeBob, Sandy's here to pick out the nearest flower for the birthday cake party.
SpongeBob: Mother of pearl! [hanging up] Why is this the biggest birthday cake ever?
Sandy: You asked for it. [Cut to SpongeBob bringing out the cake shavings]
