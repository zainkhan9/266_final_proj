[The episode starts off with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to work. Patrick is wearing a hat and holding a whistle.]
SpongeBob: So, id ya, boss?
[Patrick starts to hog the job. He beats SpongeBob to it and makes him swallow his hat. He thenates it with his mouth and makes it giggle.]
Patrick: Well, that's great, but it's time to go home. Home we are, sir. We are the bosses. We are not allowed to go back to the Krusty Krab until we have a replacement. That replacement must be cheap, natural, and new.
[Suddenly, the whistle sounds.]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! What was that?!
Patrick: I don't want to go back to the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob: Patrick! You're the boss!
Patrick: Yes, I am.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob pushing Gary away.]
SpongeBob: But you can't go back. It'll cost a fortune.
Gary: [jumps angrily] You'll never get my deal.
SpongeBob: Gary! I'm sorry. Goodbye. [Gary pulls himself out of the way and runs back into the boat] I was just kidding.
[As Gary closes his eyes and Gary stops running, the scene fades to the present.]
Perch Perkins: And that's what it says on the side of the Krusty Krab... [freaks out] but what is this lousy oyster doing in my yard? [gulps and looks at the oyster] He's trying to eat me food yard, and I told him to stay away from the yard!
[The oyster gobbles up SpongeBob and Patrick's yards. He runs over to Harold and Margaret's yards and opens a door.]
Harold and Margaret: Whew!
Margaret: More vegetables, [pulls out some grains of sand] and drinks the fruit juice.
Harold and Margaret: Not so fast! [pulls out their books and starts to read] "The Endangered Little Rare Candy Island Islandâ€”The Endangered Little Rare Candy Island?"
[The oyster bites Margaret and Harold, two of his favorite things, causing Margaret to feel bad.]
Margaret: My leg!
[Harold continues to feel miserable. The oyster bites him even more and he starts crying.]
Harold: It's okay, baby! I'm so glad that's over.
[The oyster bites him even more and he starts back down. The oyster starts bumping into Mr. Krabs' pillow. Mr. Krabs' pillow starts to bounce back and forth between his fantasy home and reality. It turns out that the only thing that's different about Mr. Krabs' house is that everything's connected. Every fiber of Mr. Krabs' skin is pulsing and changing.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh?[he sees his house from the outside, but his own. He jumps up and sees his castle in the middle, floating in the middle of the room. He gets back up and he's frozen in a coffin containing ice.]
Ice Cream: Night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Huh?[spits and blows, his cold voice echoing off]
Ice Cream King: [drops his ice cream mug] Night, midnight drinking capstone. [steals it and carries it to his castle]
[The two are now about to board a small, black, plastic boat]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are scared, but Mr. Krabs is happy.]
Mr. Krabs: That's right, that's the guy. You can trust me.
[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle, and Mr. Krabs carries them to the boat.]
SpongeBob: Gosh, Mr. Krabs, we were going to steal that recipe book from you.
Patrick: I'm not a genius, but I have my own secret recipe book.
[SpongeBob looks in the kitchen and sees everything in the kitchen is made of wood, glass, and tin.]
SpongeBob: What's that?
[The kitchen window changes to show the tins of oatmeal on the stove. SpongeBob shakes his head.]
Patrick: I don't know, SpongeBob.
[Patrick starts to sweat. SpongeBob grabs Patrick and carries him into the kitchen. Patrick is sweating with half a bowl of oatmeal on his head.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah. Good night, Patrick. [his brain just ignores SpongeBob] Good night, Mr. Krabs. [slurps his oatmeal]
