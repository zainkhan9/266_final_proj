SpongeBob: [singing] ♪Mother, don't worry, everything is okay.♪ [cut to SpongeBob and Mrs Gare's house where they put the flowers on the flowers bed. Cut to Mrs Gare visiting her old husband]
Mrs. Puff: [notices SpongeBob] ♪Yes, SpongeBob. You're my best friend ever.♪ [cut back to SpongeBob and Mrs Puff's baby carriage which drives off]
SpongeBob: Isn't it great to get news and begin to talk about new friends?
Mrs. Puff: I don't have much time.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I do have a lot now.
Mrs. Puff: Are you sure you don't owe me two, gaspings just to get through the front door?
SpongeBob: No, I don't owe anybody a formal letter. This is my baby. [shows a picture of her baby brother]
Mrs. Puff: Are you sure you don't owe me yet another balloon?
SpongeBob: Huh?
Mrs. Puff: I don't think so. Wait. Wait. Why?
SpongeBob: Because I thought you didn't owe me two.
Mrs. Puff: Why? Oh, that's nothing! You didn't owe me two tickets!
SpongeBob: But I didn't have either!
Mrs. Puff: Sorry but I won't either.
SpongeBob: No, Mrs. Puff, I don't have either of those.
Mrs. Puff: No...
SpongeBob: [gets off the carriage] Mrs. Puff, wait! [jumps out and gets picked up by Mrs. Puff] Phew. I think I'll pass.
[bubble transition to SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff's baby carriage drives off]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, now's the time to stop alluding to my naughty deeds! [takes the wheelbarrow of Mrs. Puff's car with him] Well?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [the car drives off] I'm it! [stops at the end of the parking lot. A sign that reads 'Free Parking'] Huh? [bubble transition to SpongeBob's house, which has a sign that says 'Free Parking'] Wait. No free parking. [walks in and starts to walk away. A person walks in, and Mr. Krabs comes walking out, his face shown. He is wearing a business suit, and a business hat with business logos on his hats]
Mr. Krabs: [through walkie-talkie] Hello, Mrs. Puff. Would you like to...
Mrs. Puff: Never mind! [slams the door on SpongeBob's face] I think SpongeBob might be in trouble. Why, he's even worse off without me than without you! [slams the door on SpongeBob's face again]
Mr. Krabs: [through walkie-talkie] This might be working. [about to hear another noise]
Mrs. Puff: [gasp] What's this? Someone's knocking on the door.
Mr. Krabs: [angry, still] Why, I've got a great job as business manager, but there's no one there.
Mrs. Puff: Why?
Mr. Krabs: 'Cause business people aren't mean. They'll stand right there and let you go, just as long as there's a demand.
Mrs. Puff: Oh. So there's gonna be a few empty mouths?
Mr. Krabs: [angry] No! Not really. [walks over to SpongeBob] I think we've had enough. We've got a really big order.
SpongeBob: Oh, great! [holds up a large stack of Krabby Patties on a tray] Here's your order.
Mr. Krabs: [frustrated] No! I orders here, from Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob: Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: [stationary shaking] Barnacles! Wait! Stop! [SpongeBob shoving the patties into the order window. He tries to get his hands on them, but they stick. SpongeBob puts the patties into the order and off he go. Off he lies down. Mr. Krabs is about to pick up the tab, but another customer walks up and walks away. One Krabby Patty falls on SpongeBob's nose.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, sorry, sir. I'm sorry. [Mr. Krabs rubs his thumb over the patty.] Oh.
