[The scene changes to Bikini Bottom, the exterior of which has been cleaned up a lot.]
French Narrator: So this is where movies like 'The Movable Basement' and 'The Movable Hand' fall into play out west. How 'cause they're free-form.
Shark Cop: [laughs] I think it's fresher than you could say. [pokes the spooky crawly crawly crawly]
[The scene changes to show the exterior of the Krusty Krab with its feet pointing in the air.]
Mr. Krabs: Fresh patties, fresh patties, fresh patties. I think we better open up and get some work done.
[The scene changes to show Squidward sleeping at his table in the dark.]
Squidward: Oh, what's going on?
[The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs outside the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: I don't really remember you, do I? [holds out hand] Sorry, just a... just a hand, just a small...
Squidward: No, I'm talking about YOU!
Mr. Krabs: [points to SpongeBob] Now, take that table and make your bed.
Squidward: Okay! [takes out the blanket and puts it on the table] This is where I work the register. [makes sure the table is cleared of the word 'patties' and plants the pineapple under the word 'patties' again]
[Squidward wakes up in the middle of the street and sees Mr. Krabs making new dollar signs.]
Mr. Krabs: And now, uhh, once a year, a trespasser will be thrown from his home for no more than one year's pay.
[The scene changes to show Squidward walking to work. She sees a little pink crab at the door station and laughs at the crab. Then, the crab makes a surprise entrance, squirting water in Squidward's nose.]
Carpenter: Here's your drink, Squidward.
Squidward: Huh, big deal. I work here. [The crab squirts water in Squidward's nose]
Carpenter: Here's your drink, Mr. Squidward.
Squidward: Huh? [gulps] I don't work here. What does this have to do with cooking? [He swallows the water and his eyes become wide and his mind fogges, leaving him unable to think]
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... well, it's just that today is the first day of training camp.
Squidward: I'm training camp? [Mr. Krabs jumps up and down with his eyes covered with his arms] Well, what's this? Branster? Gee, you forgot any gloves.
Mr. Krabs: Those are in my office.
Squidward: I don't need gloves, Mr. Krabs. [the crabs come out of the door and start clapping] They're learning.
Mr. Krabs: ...Huh?
Squidward: ...Camp, camp, and camp!
Mr. Krabs: You mean you're not gonna break any records?
Squidward: [starting to cry] I've broken even, Mr. Krabs. [Breaks record again and throws the record in the air]
Mr. Krabs: Breaking even?... Record...! Record...!
Squidward: But, but, Mr. Krabs, now are we gonna break even...
Mr. Krabs: Oh, okay, I've got records to show for this, I'm a good record reader.
Squidward: Baby, are you okay?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm a good record reader, too. Now, would you...
Squidward: Oh, really?
SpongeBob: Oh, really, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Baby, are you okay?
SpongeBob: Oh, really, Mr. Krabs! Can't you just... you're minding your own business?
Squidward:...What? How?
SpongeBob: I need you to be my guest of honor.
Squidward: Grandpa?
SpongeBob: I know what you're up to, Mr. Krabs. I just want to...
Squidward: Break records!
SpongeBob: I'm breaking all kinds of stuff, Squidward. I'm breaking into stuff with my crazy theory days! I'm breaking into the minds of people! [laughs, then he walks away] What the...? What? ...Huh?
Squidward: That was new and different.
SpongeBob: And you're telling me...
