[The episode starts with Gary watching TV and listening to the radio.]
Drizzle: [laughs] Huh? [sees a kid driving his boat] Ooh, I think I'll pass for a decent daytime television show this fall. [laughs again]
Kids: [giggles] [to themselves]
Drizzle: No, thanks, I'm not paying you to drive; I'm paying you to get away. [enters his or her toothbrush with teethbrush paper in each hand]
Kids: [to each other, using squeaky toys as sinks]
Drizzle: Hey, what are you kids doing this morning?
Drizzle: I'm trying to learn to drive.
Kids: [to each other, while using their squeaky mouths as sinks]
Drizzle: [in his boat] Come back here! [yelps as he drives away]
SpongeBob: Okay, kids, let's go drive. SpongeBob, you are a nightmare.
Drizzle: Come back, I'm not paying you! [rips off his surf-suit]
SpongeBob: Bye, bye. Excuse me, miss.
Drizzle: Come back, I'm not paying you! [drives off, but hits Norton]
Norton: $誜개개갔!
[Norton screams and runs back into his house. SpongeBob is so scared and shocked that he looks at Drizzle and says, "Ugh, that sounded really good to me". The episode ends with SpongeBob and Patrick taking a drive. After a brief break, the camera rotates to a TV in the kitchen. The scene opens up on Patrick to show SpongeBob and SpongeBob a tank which says "STOW THIS BEHIND YOU!" It then fades to SpongeBob running with the tank.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, this is a dream. [laughs]
Patrick: Yeah, I'll show ya! [runs into the bus, which then wheels them into the house]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, I'm driving!
Patrick: Wow! Wanna pass me? [SpongeBob takes the tank.] Hey, friend, is this kelp kelp? [SpongeBob shakes the tank.] Mm-hmm. Oh, this is a kelp kelp. [laughs]
[SpongeBob drives out of the house and back. Then he comes back with another tank.]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, this is a kelp kelp!
Patrick: Yuck, man. I gotta get to work. [laughs. SpongeBob walks over to a cash register.] Here I go.
[SpongeBob writes on the register.]
Patrick: Did I do a typo?
SpongeBob: No, that's right.
Patrick: Gee, how about this one easier?
SpongeBob: Easy.
Patrick: Yup.
[Patrick's tank is shown.]
SpongeBob: Okay, easy peasy...
[SpongeBob drives out of his house.]
Patrick: [groans] This is the last test.
[Patrick's watering can burns off.]
Patrick: No more tests. I gotta get to work. [takes out a megaphone, which turns out to be the Kindergarten Pony.]
Echo: Okay, Pony. One to one, two to three. You drive.
Patrick: I got it. [picks up megaphone] Pony one, one, two, three.
[Patrick's watering can gets even more stuck in Patrick's watering can. Patrick tries to get SpongeBob's attention, but the megaphone stops him.]
Patrick: Stop! [karate chops the megaphone]
SpongeBob: Can't you see I got this? Pony two, three, four.
[SpongeBob takes the megaphone and starts playing music. Suddenly, the megaphone starts to wake up and starts attacking Patrick.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
[Patrick wakes up from his "accident." SpongeBob looks scared. He walks over to Patrick and grabs his arm.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's my favorite birthday present.
Patrick: Arrgh!
[SpongeBob gets his hand back in his head. Scene cuts to the Kindergarten Pony outside.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Grandma. We've got ice cream in every pie.
Grandma: Ice cream? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Oh, Grandma's allergy thing? [points to his broken mirror]
Grandma: I thought you might want to see the new Angry Pony TV special.
