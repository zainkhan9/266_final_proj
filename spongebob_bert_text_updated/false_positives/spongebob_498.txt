SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: [Walking to SpongeBob] SpongeBob, I'm getting back into my comfort zone. This is getting creepy.
SpongeBob: I've never been on too close to anything before.
Squidward: Yeah, what are you gonna do about it? [scared laugh]
SpongeBob: I don't know. What scares me is probably your nose?
Squidward: Nose? What scares me is... [screams] Nose! [runs through a bush and falls over on his head]
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, wait. Don't run away!
Squidward: I can't stand what's going on around me! Wait, no, don't run away. [runs into his house and screams] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! [takes out a pen] Wait, wait, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [hears a knock on the door. SpongeBob opens it] Did someone call the police? [walks to the front door]
SpongeBob: What's the problem? [there is a knock on the door]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, we should be soaking up the news. [SpongeBob opens the door, and Mr. Krabs screams in horror]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I didn't say it was Squidward!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What is it?
SpongeBob: I need you to... [he points at Mr. Krabs' face] ...MOM.
Mr. Krabs: It's... me...Daddy!
SpongeBob: Oh, please let me stay at your place of business! Oh, please, Mr. Krabs, you're such a motherfucker! [Mr. Krabs cries]
Mr. Krabs: Is it love or hookers, boy?
SpongeBob: I love you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It's a burning question. And this is the most important question in all of Royal Navy business! [flashback to Patrick's wedding] Patrick, I've had a beautiful daughter and a great friend. What can I do? I've got to do everything in my power to make sure she never crosses the street ever again! [Patrick drives a boat]
Patrick: Uh, don't do it! What's so tough about it?!
Patrick: When she gets a slop, it's so bad, I mean, when your first pillows are growing big and hairy, and growing mean and furry, and eyes are every bit as eye-obsingbertyvolent as they were before!
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Patrick?
Patrick: [screams] Squeaky, squeaky.
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Patrick?
Patrick: [screams] Squeaky, squeaky.
SpongeBob: [takes out a pillow, covers it up, and wiggles it around] Spongy eyes?
Patrick: [kicks it back around, this time with a screw] Squeaky, squeaky.
SpongeBob: [wiggles it around, makes weird noises, and makes other noises] Squeaky, squeaky.
Patrick: [screams again] Squeaky, squeaky.
SpongeBob: [screams again] Squeaky, squeaky.
Patrick: [screams again] Squeaky, squeaky.
SpongeBob: [screams again] Squeaky, squeaky.
Patrick: [screams] Squeaky, squeaky.
SpongeBob: [screams] Squeaky, squeaky.
Patrick: [screams] Squeaky, squeaky.

SpongeBob: [screams] Squeaky, squeaky.
 [Each scream and screech like a bunch of babies]
Patrick: [Like babies] Sweet baby, what's in your belly? [to Patrick] Now, baby, you're a wild one.
SpongeBob: [to Patrick] Lonnie, I don't want to have to say this, but you're pretty wild animals myself. Now I wanna tell you how you're just as dumb as your baby. [screams and walks away]
Baby Patrick: Lonnie, what are you doing? I'm a... [to Lonnie] babysitter.
