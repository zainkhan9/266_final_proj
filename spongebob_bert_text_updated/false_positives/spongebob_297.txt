[episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick walking through Jellyfish Fields]
SpongeBob: Let's go!
Patrick: Great idea, SpongeBob! [jellyfish fly away. SpongeBob and Patrick start crying]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, I'll memorize all the menu items for you!
Patrick: [jellyfish fly away again] How'd you know?
SpongeBob: I've never gone to a school before where I can only pick up a hand-held. Huh? [SpongeBob's hand is pushed into a table] What are you doing with this? I mean, a jellyfish net?
Patrick: No, I've only got me hand. [tries to pick it up with his foot, which isn't broken]
SpongeBob: Hey, you could thumb your nose at me. [Patrick does so]
Patrick: Uhh, let's get going. [Patrick runs, and the jellyfish fly by]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick! I wouldn't go that way! Hmm... [thinking] Hmm... A-ha! Look at the time. I've got to get home. I've got to get ready for work. [going back to work] What would the world be without jellyfish do?
Patrick: I'd like to jellyfishing... [starts to cry] and eating... and sleeping... [SpongeBob quickly puts his hand in his mouth] and eating and sleeping and everything without 'em! [Both start flossing their hands]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, I don't want all this stuff to go away. I've got some concerns I... Well, none of this is good. [Patrick flosses his hand, and SpongeBob screams. Cuts to later]
Patrick: Ah, hello, boss!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'd like you to meet my friend, Squidward.
Patrick: Hmph! Here it is, Gianter! [cuts to restaurant. Mr. Krabs is walking out on Squidward in his business suit]
Mr. Krabs: Hmph! This is terrible, Squidward! What could be wrong with this outfit? [takes off shirt] It's terribly flabby. [walks out on a rock] Worse than rotting under a thousand feet of mud! [Patrick screams and runs out on the rock. Cuts to SpongeBob in another suit, this time with a different shirt but this one with a red flag on it] Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry. [Mr. Krabs turns back around] Don't go, don't be sad, Mr. Squidward. We'll find a solution to this. You'll be at the Krusty Krab, working at the Krusty Krab, on the orders of one of your famous customers. Mr. Krabs, have you met the lovely husband you've chosen?
Mr. Krabs: The husband you've chosen? The opposite. I'm afraid I'm going to be tasing you until you give me the order alright.
SpongeBob: Don't be afraid, Mr. Krabs. My duties are to you as manager are exclusively mine.
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: No. But you are the manager's responsibility.
Mr. Krabs: Oh okay, then. If you don't mind, fine. [enters laughing at SpongeBob's acting]
SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Good evening. I hope you'll join me for a day of quiet appreciation. I'd love to take you here with me to the amusement of his thoughts.
SpongeBob: What would you like, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What would you like, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Neptune's bathtub!
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [gasps] Really? I thought you were going to throw away the most essential ingredient of... anything. [pause] Ah. [takes off shirt] Nuts.
[SpongeBob gasps, then takes the shirt off his head.]
SpongeBob: Uh. Uh. Uh.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes?
Mr. Krabs: Would you like me to sign some paintings?
SpongeBob: Of course. [Mr. Krabs takes the shirt as his is carved into the shape of a face]
Mr. Krabs: Great. Now, where do I sign?
SpongeBob: You are the manager's responsibility.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hi. Uh. Hi. [shuts the curtain] How are ya doing?
