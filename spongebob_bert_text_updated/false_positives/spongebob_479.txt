[The episode begins with an exterior shot of SpongeBob's pineapple. An exterior close-up of SpongeBob's pineapple is shown. The scene pans out to show the exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple, but it is cut. The scene changes to show SpongeBob's front of the boat, with sunglasses and a close-up of his face, with his hands behind his back. SpongeBob opens his front door, and we see that it has a "Please post only" sign on the roof. He walks back inside, and we hear a crash.]
SpongeBob: I'm not sure if I can hear you, Squidward. [We then hear the boat's gas tank shudder, and a scary sound is heard.] That's not a submarine!
[We then see a scary sound called "squidward's karate chop"]
Squidward: [In a low, worried tone] I don't want to be a SQUIDWARD!
[We then see that Squidward is only in his underwear. The boat is heard shuddering with oil lamps burning in its place, and a scallop bush later...]

SpongeBob: Well, Squidward, at least I'm not naked.
[A title card for the episode reads, "Science!"]
Television Announcer: It appears that this proposition in-person has attracted the attention of the Krusty Krab Food Safety Officer.
HSSPO: Your Honor, this is the man who may be the subject of this unsanctioned speech. Would you please step- foot into the kitchen of my restaurant, and expose your behind?
SpongeBob: My behind! Oh, yes, I will!
Hans: Oh, that'll be great!
[SpongeBob puts on a Krusty Krab hat and exposes his behind. Hans walks over with a metal detector and Hans exposes his behind. Hans shows the hat to the police officers.]
Police Officers: Hans, give me the truth! Hello, evil laughestar!
SpongeBob: Evil laughestar?
Hans: Yes, sir.
[Police officers on motorcycles stop and look at SpongeBob and SpongeBob. Officer #2 was driving and puts his helmet on, then drives. The motorcycle stops and shows the hat and the Krusty Krab inside. Officer #2 thinks for a second and looks at it and then he asked the obvious question, "Why?"]
Officer #2: Why?
SpongeBob: Because that's what Hans W. Frankel called the 'buried' part of the speech!
Hans: [off-camera] What part?
Officer #2: [As he is going through the X-Ray of the Krusty Krab] that, sir.
[Hans sighs and bends down to reveal a 2-D picture of the Krusty Krab hat. He then reveals the Krabby Patty hat part of his speech.]
SpongeBob: Wow! What did you call this thing working, hmm? [We see a 3-D view of the hat] What is the name of this thing?
Hans: It's funny, SpongeBob, you'll have to say the Krusty Krab's.
Officer #2: Why, thank you. Krusty Krab. [Hans whimpers]
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry. Uh, we don't serve food at the Krusty Krab.
[Officer #2 looks at SpongeBob and gasps]
Officer #2: Who, or what, or what, or what?
[Officer #2 huffs]
SpongeBob: Uh, we don't serve food.
[Officer #2 looks at him]
Officer #2: Food?
SpongeBob: No, we don't serve food.
[Officer #2 looks at SpongeBob. He gasps] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob jumps like a balloon while displaying his balance and makes a wide angle TV camera picture while Officer #2 gives SpongeBob a red noisemaker. SpongeBob starts to cry and sticks his tongue out. Then he starts to pull it off his tongue] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob's heart snuffs and he cries a sack of dry-ice. Officer #2 says, "It's over, SpongeBob."]
