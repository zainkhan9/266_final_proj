SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward! Neptune's trousers! Pants! Here we are, sir!
Squidward: Huh? [thinking] Oh, yeah, this hotel is way too close and I'd be excused for not paying the hotel registration fee if I were in my hotel room.
SpongeBob: But, but, but, but...
Squidward: [fakes paying bill by pretending to walk in the room] Look, I got to go. Why not go on for one minute and admire my art? I can be more than ever.
SpongeBob: Why, thank you, Squidward.
Squidward: Thank you. Respect for the law. [walks out]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, if I could reachâ€¦
Squidward: No. Citation.
SpongeBob: How's it going, Squidward?
Squidward: SpongeBob SquarePants, have mercy on my soul! [Pushes SpongeBob away]
SpongeBob: That was a lot of pressure to have such a great show, Squidward. But, so be it. [Scene switches to SpongeBob holding the Krusty Krab waterfowl]
Narrator: Lunch Break.
SpongeBob: Yeah, that sounds perfect. I want to go to the Gary Show.
Narrator: Later. [SpongeBob knocks on the door and Gary answers it]
SpongeBob: Bye, Grandma!
Gary: [off-screen] Meow!
SpongeBob: [talking to Grandma] I just came to pick up your precious little friend, Gary.
Gary: [leaning on the door handles] Who do you want?
SpongeBob: S... [giggles] S... [Gary starts crying] Gary! [sees that the waterfowl have vanished] Oh, what a beautiful day. I'll never find out what blessed existence all this excitement was, Gary.
Gary: Yeah, what don't get excited about, Gary. [lights turn off] My laboratory is showing signs of life. Looking all over the place. My laboratory is glowing with life. I can see clearly. [Gary hands the lion's share of the lion's share] Gary, you got that?
SpongeBob: It's the opposite. It's the opposite sign. It's the opposite sign only. It's the opposite sign only because it's in the middle of the rainbow.
Gary: [louder] Meow.
SpongeBob: The opposite because it's in the middle of the rainbow?
Gary: [laughs] Gary! Look at this! [Gary throws the lion's share of the lion's share] Gary! Look at this! [Gary throws the rainbow's basket] Gary! Look at this! [Gary throws SpongeBob's shoulders] Gary! Look at this! [Gary throws SpongeBob's legs] Gary! Look at this! [Gary throws SpongeBob's mouth] Gary! Look at this! [Gary throws SpongeBob's nose] Gary! [trips and falls over] G-g-g-g-Gary! [spots the lion's share of the lion's share] GHOSTS OF THE GRAB! Come on, G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G--
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What are you doing out here, Squidward?
Squidward: I'm here for you. [clings to SpongeBob] I need your help, quit my depression. [hooks SpongeBob on the elbow and stretches] Whew! Can we do this, SpongeBob? Can we do this, please?
SpongeBob: Sure.
Squidward: Good. Now put the camera right in the heart of this garbage dump and...
SpongeBob: Put it on the D-O-W-Lisp!
