[It is warm in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: It's getting warmer outside.
Patrick: How's that for a slushy day outside?
SpongeBob: Run, Gary, run!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: That's right, Gary, don't run! [SpongeBob runs away while Patrick scares him. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick outside]
SpongeBob: Give me a break, Gary. But I'm just here to observe. And you to observe. And they're all gathered here under this banner of 'Free the Puppy Rescue'.[Gary is frozen in ice cream] Gary? Gary?! Gary?!
Patrick: [offscreen] Sorry. [offscreen] The party's over! [Gary's body is pulled in by his ice cream scoop and his body becomes covered in ice cream]
SpongeBob: It's almost time for the party to start. It's so hot outside.
Patrick: Let's take a little hike outside.
[Cut to outside]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick, we gotta get back! [cries]
Patrick: Me neither. Let's go! [hangs up the ice cream cone]
SpongeBob: Yeah! [hangs up the ice cream]
Patrick: Yeah!
[Cut to the reunion, with SpongeBob still holding the key]
SpongeBob: Let's get back, Patrick.
Patrick: Let's do it, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: But, but, but, but, but, but, but! [force pulls SpongeBob back up]
Patrick: SpongeBob, no, wait, no, no! [force pulls back the stick]! You hand over the key, hand over.. [SpongeBob gets the key back]..DE me me me me! [opens the door and turns the key around to reveal the key in Patrick's stomach] The bloody key.
SpongeBob: I got it, Patrick! [the scene then changes to show the all of the supplies packed inside the trusty cork board boat] The feverish nature of the task makes it all but too easy for SpongeBob to lose his.
Patrick: [hands the board to SpongeBob] It's no use, SpongeBob. I don't want to be the guy who gets injured in a bike ride.
SpongeBob: [laughs] You're right, Patrick. I shall not be attacked with a light switch, with this iron, with this hammer, this [turns the light switch to black] with this hammer, this [turns it back on] with this iron, with this iron! [is now covered in ice cream] This ice cream tastes like fresh cream. [Patrick puts a spoon on his back. As he is drinking the water, SpongeBob starts sliding on his hands and legs while Patrick holds on to his arm.]
[Cut to Patrick on the diving board, crying. The scene changes to show SpongeBob's face, his eyes, and his nose. He is now on the board.]
SpongeBob: Aw, mom, my turn.
Mable: Why must the world's greatest hypnot dancer be left to his own devices? [telephone rings. SpongeBob gasps] Why, hello? Hello SpongeBob, what are you doing here? I'm SpongeBob's mother. I'm always here. I ask you to be the mascot of SpongeBob's Apron Party. Mable, you're kinda weird. Are you with the gang because you want to be seen to be done?... [SpongeBob gasps again. Mable walks up to SpongeBob] Well, you're the greatest dancer ever. How about you to be on the partyfloater committee?... [SpongeBob gasps again. Mable walks up to SpongeBob] Well, you might as well give up being the partyfloater. Who dares?... [SpongeBob gasps again. Mable walks up to SpongeBob] Well, you might as well give up being the partyfloater. Who dares?... [SpongeBob gasps again. Mable walks up to SpongeBob] Not SpongeBob! [SpongeBob walks up. Cut to later where SpongeBob and Mable are still at the reunion]
SpongeBob: And when I was still still still still, you were still still still okay, even after you were still still molested. And you teased me the whole way. [SpongeBob cries] I don't remember anything.
Mable, SpongeBob: What are you talking about? I molested you. [Mable takes the crack. Cut to SpongeBob and Mable]
SpongeBob: Oh, really? Well, you can retract your earlier, horrible, accusation.
Mable: Can retract?
