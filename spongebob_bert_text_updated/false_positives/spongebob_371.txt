[The episode begins with Patrick running through Jellyfish Fields carrying a tray with a Krabby Patty and some fries.]
Patrick: [through the phone] Hello? My name is Patrick and I need your help with the Bikini Bottom Jail. I also need your help with the Prison for Free Speech chain-bed.
Mr. Krabs: Hey there, that's Mr. Squidward. What did I tell you about taking bad jokes?
Patrick: Oh, sorry, Mr. Krabs. Just call me "Situation" and I'll put him in charge of the jail.
Mr. Krabs: Alright, situation, fry cook. What do you say?
Situation: We should prison those jokesters, and give them jail-bait juice.
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, you got one less SpongeBob to worry about. [puts hairnet on SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, boy, don't be nervous. I'll take care of it. [Patrick grabs the hairnet and puts it on his head]
Situation: We've got a situation. We should all take a prison camp.
[Patrick laughs.]
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, I think we should all take a few deep, abiding, mental notes before we go into a place of actual, actual, actual, actual, actual, actual prison. [Patrick grabs SpongeBob's mouth]
Patrick: SpongeBob, do you have any mental notes for Gary?
SpongeBob: [slaps Patrick] Gary? Doesn't matter. I love you, you know. Sleep well, Patrick. [points to Gary, he gets up, yawns] You know, my brains are kind of down here. [sees Patrick's feet moving] Oh, boy, that Gary caught the run of the worms. [Gary slithers across the floor, SpongeBob digs in his hole and sees how old he is] Doesn't matter. I love you, like. [Gary moves across the floor and SpongeBob digs in another hole] I like you, like, old. [Gary moves across the floor of the Krusty Krab, Gary crawls around the kitchen, and I hear his snoring] Doesn't matter. [I still hear Gary's snores] I love you, like, all over. [He lands on SpongeBob's head. Gary takes a liking to SpongeBob and growls angrily at him] He's a big, ugly prick, and I love it! [As Gary goes back into SpongeBob's head, the scene transitions to SpongeBob and Gary walking out of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary, see you tomorrow. [walks off] Salutations, Gary! [Gary walks up there] Hey, buddy. Hey, look. [Gary frowns] Can I touch you? [winks] I'm such a lucky cat. [Gary touches him gently, letting go of his thumb. Gary holds his thumb up to hand] You want me to touch you? [Gary touches him again, letting go of his thumb. Gary holds his thumb up to hand again] Okay, okay, do you want me...? [Gary touches him] Oh, rub it? [Gary touches him again] Oh, oh, okay, yeah, yeah, okay, Gary! [cut to the Krusty Krab, where the two sit down eating food]
Squidward: [on floor looking at a food bowl] Am I getting any food?
SpongeBob: [looks at bowl] Am I getting any food?
Squidward: [sighs] I was just about to tell you that Gary was a little bit weird, but then he came up to me and... [cut to SpongeBob sitting next to Squidward, touching his tongue to taste, then take a bite]
SpongeBob: [talking to Squidward] Good job, buddy.
Squidward: So, I'm a little weird about Gary.
SpongeBob: Oh, so, uh, how's that weird guy named after you?
Squidward: [laughs] I don't know.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Ah, it's kind of nice when Squidward sees you. [laughs]
Squidward: Yeah, is it?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Yeah. Funny bow. Sometimes, I like to laugh along.
Squidward: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Yeah. [laughsefully]
Squidward: Yeah, okay, okay, okay. [cracks his back] Yeah, yeah. Yeah. [thinks he sees the 'って' through which he says he wants to say]
SpongeBob: Hey, that's not so weird after all!
