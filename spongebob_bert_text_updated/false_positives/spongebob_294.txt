[The episode starts off with a storybook entitled "Gone with the Sun"]
Old Man Jenkins: [clears throat] The Krusty Krab mustard is gone. Gone is the all-too-realized storybook version. We are left with... [screen goes blank]
Mr. Krabs: No! D-d-don't do it again! You're gonna have to grow me some eyelids!
Old Man Jenkins: [his eyestalk was cut off] Turns out he's got one still in his hand.
Mr. Krabs: [his eyestalk was cut off] Then I have to keep him out of my own sight!
Old Man Jenkins: [his eyestalk was cut off] Then what?
[Mr. Krabs grabs the eyelids and starts pulling them out at them. Then he sings to himself, screaming. Then he starts taking away the eyelids with various means.]
Mr. Krabs: [his eyeball is reduced to a ball and he keeps pulling them out] Ooh-whoa-oh, now that I've got the ability to remove all my eyelids, it's time to get serious...
SpongeBob: [talking to Mrs. Puff] Don't just stand there, please! I'll be there in seconds! [runs over to Mrs. Puff] I've got to get in there! Open up! Gary, what are you doing?
Mrs. Puff: [dotted] hours ago.
Mr. Krabs: Hang in there, Karen! I'll get around to doing it! Huh! [running after his little love interest] I've got to make sure the situation gets out of hand.
Karen: No way! You're not old. I've never seen you do that before.
Mrs. Puff: That's enough, me dear. Now could you please turn the lights off so I can sleep in my bed?
[Mr. Krabs is drooling over a sleeping balloon. The screen turns black, episode starts]
LRH: [in bed with SpongeBob] This is it, boy! We're almost in the middle of the most significant fantasy moment in my entire life! Now I want only the very best for my beloved Plankton!
LRH: Unhand me, don't [This causes him to blow his breath out, then he sniffs the air] what's in it for him?
[LRH blows his breath out]
LRH: This ain't nothing.
[An octopus with a face like LRH appears]
LRH: I'm alive! I'm alive! I'm alive!
[LRH is breathing heavily]
LRH: That's enough, me dear!
SpongeBob: LRH, hurry! I've got to do it! 
[The octopus shows his face again] 
LRH: Give me that! Now back to me!
[The octopus gives SpongeBob a red ribbon and a box]
SpongeBob: LRH, LRH, LRH, LRH, LRH, LRH!
[The box is pushed out of frame]
LRH: This'll be easy, little sponge. I just need to mask up his color.
[The box is pushed out again and SpongeBob does a karate yell]
SpongeBob: No better hiding spot for the little guy. I found him. I gotta find him!
[SpongeBob's face fuzzes]
SpongeBob: Uh, something wrong?
LRH: Don't worry, I got you figured on that!
SpongeBob: Uh, what's a figure?
LRH: A point.
SpongeBob: Uh, you mean his shell?
LRH: A point.
SpongeBob: Uh, he doesn't have a point.
LRH: Oh, okay then.
SpongeBob: Uh, he doesn't have a point. He does have a point.
LRH: Oh, okay.
SpongeBob: Uh, he doesn't have a point, either. He doesn't have a point.
LRH: Oh... [points to his skeleton] Hermit crab, pink snails, giant frilly sea star, and gold eye of Neptune.
[LRH sees SpongeBob's skeleton through window]
LRH: Look at you. You look pretty scary now.
SpongeBob: Uh, I was just about to tell you that point thinges are not half-a-a-a moons, you know.
LRH: Not half-a-a-a moons, you know? Not even an inch of moon!
