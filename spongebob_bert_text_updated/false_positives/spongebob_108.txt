[The episode begins with a live-action stock footage of a brand-new episode. The episode's title is changed to "The Next Great Superstar Appears!"]
Squidward: [reading to himself as he walks down the hallway] SpongeBob! Come on. Down here, you have to look! Let's start with the most beautiful town in the middle of nowhere.
SpongeBob: Uhh... town? I thought that was New York.
Squidward: Great, I'll be in my room.
SpongeBob: I know just where to start.
[SpongeBob and Patrick set SpongeBob down on a chair]
Patrick: Figure out a couch.
SpongeBob: That's the most fun I've had in a while.
[SpongeBob tries the controls, but falls]
Patrick: That was too hard? Everyone seems to be losing them. Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob and Patrick hop on each other's shoulders. Scene cuts to the SpongeBob and Patrick computer in a room]
Patrick: How does one keep all this in check?
SpongeBob: Just remember what I told you...
Patrick: Be right there.
SpongeBob: Are you sure?
Patrick: Let's go check it out.
[Scene cuts to the kitchen. Patrick tries the "Sit Me Down" chair before he finishes]
Patrick: That was terrible! Oh well. Let's get ready for bed.
[Scene cuts to the dining area. Patrick tries the "Cross My Way and Outcomes" glass before he finishes]
Patrick: That was fantastic! [He starts singing the praises of glass]
SpongeBob: Bye, everyone! I trusted you with this thing. Now it's all over for a second. You should be able to trust me. [He starts crying]
Patrick: Oh, please, SpongeBob, everything is going to be fine. You have no idea what day it is.
SpongeBob: Oh, it's, uh... octopus!
Patrick: Oh, boy! Octopus! [Both hug each other]
SpongeBob: Ew, this isn't the nicest day in town.
Patrick: Oh, don't be mean, SpongeBob. It's a very good day in town.
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward, I did say the octopus should be invited back.
Squidward: [offscreen] Hmmm... [Octopus appears next to him]
SpongeBob: You're the best octopus ever.
Squidward: I love my job at the Krusty Krab, and I love my new vacuum.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. I am.
Squidward: But you replaced me as fry cook, and there's this weird rule that says if you're not the most beautiful creature on the planet, then you're not the most beautiful creature on Earth.
SpongeBob: Oh, um, well, what are you still called?
Squidward: The fly-thru rule was just a way of saying, 'Kay, make sure I am not the most beautiful creature on the planet, or else.
SpongeBob: Don't forget to trust me, Squidward.
[Squidward bangs on SpongeBob's desk, causing a hole in the ceiling of the house to get hit by the ceiling. The roof falls down, destroying the house. Squidward is seen outside the house with the yellow bubble]
Squidward: [screams] I've got nothing to live for! There's no place like home!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run outside as well]
SpongeBob: home. [hangs up and sees their boat demolished]
Squidward: Well, that's not to say that I don't have a sea monster under my roof. [drops his boat and gets out of his house] It's just, like, hair!
[SpongeBob and Patrick come out from the yard and talk in hushed tones]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Guess we're not the only sea monsters under our roof.
Patrick: I know! We have to get back to the limiter. [hops off and accidentally trips on a wheelbarrow]
SpongeBob: Hey! We got trash! [bumps into Patrick] We got trash, uh, uh, trash, trash! [hops to the window and points at the top] And we're not getting back on my bus!
Patrick: How long do we have to go before I get home?
SpongeBob: Just one... day.
Patrick: Two... days?
SpongeBob: Three... days.
