[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to school.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! We can do this! [SpongeBob and Patrick hold on to each other as the anchor drops.] We're so close! [SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run away] [dodges an incoming mime] Oh, boy! [tries to run with Patrick, but is tangled up by his leashed shoe] Oh, yeah. Ha-ha! [gets hit by a student] Ow! [rubs his head]
Patrick: Oh, ow! [curls his shoe out, igniting a fire; he coughs and gasps to see his picture painted picture frame; SpongeBob continues to run with Patrick as the two run up and down steps 4 and 5]
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you okay? [Patrick's rock hits the anchor and SpongeBob falls] Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, I'm fine. [hits SpongeBob in the face with the piece of rock]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! [tries to pinch Patrick's rock, but needslessly pushes it away]
Patrick: You're-a are you mad?
SpongeBob: Hey, I need you to be quiet.
Patrick: Oh, don't be, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Don't be, be quiet!
Police Officer: Attention, boy. You are under arrest.
Police Officer #1: I can't comment on suspects or suspects at the scene at this time. [Holds up a write-up saying, "Police Officer John"] But this is a police officer.
Patrick: Police officer! [charges at SpongeBob] You'll rue the day!
Police Officer: No... [SpongeBob charges at Patrick, who takes off the write-up]
Patrick: Huh? [tries to run away, but SpongeBob slaps him and takes off his head] Thanks for no reason! [SpongeBob beats him up more, and the police officers run away]
Police Officer: No... [SpongeBob beats up more people, and the officer with the bat hatts him] Thanks for no reason! [Runs off, and a pile of trash falls on Patrick]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah, I feel sorry for Patrick.
Patrick: [takes off the dumpster hat and shrugs] Yeah. He's just too sensitive.
SpongeBob: But it's you who's being blamed for the destruction of this town!
Patrick: Oh, I like being blamed! [cries]
Police Officer: Attention, boy-o! [SpongeBob runs with police officers] The road you've traveled is not smooth. Don't rush... [Crawls back into Patrick's rock]
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's not what you think!
Patrick: [running quickly back into the rock] I'm getting to the bottom of this, SpongeBob. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab?!??? Where's Chipmunk???
Patrick: Oh, he's just that old man [points to a poster with the words, Oh, we're doomed, Oh, we're doomed, Oh, we're doomed, Oh, we're doomed, we're doomed] who's responsible for this town's demise!? [All the newspapers are talking]
Norton: It wasn't you, it was this guy, Mr. Krabs. [Raises his right hand]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? Uh, Mr. Krabs... uh... the man?
Norton: Yes. [Norton turns around and raises his hand]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Norton: Yes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Norton: Yes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Norton: Yes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Norton: Yes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Norton: Yes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Norton: Yes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Norton: Yes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Norton: Yes.
Squidward: [snickers] That's just weird.
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs, at least he's not like that dumb old guy. Hey, everybody! Why don't you give some pointers?
[SpongeBob looks around]
SpongeBob: Back? But what about that poster?
