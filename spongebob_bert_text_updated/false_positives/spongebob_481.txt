[Episode starts with a shot of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick sneak into Squidward's house through the window. Squidward is in his boat locked and gagging his way to his bed by a metal door]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick!
Patrick: Want to go down to the Chum Bucket for a bit?
SpongeBob: I don't know, buddy. Maybe speaking for myself, I don't know. [laughs]
Patrick: Oh, come on, man! You'll never get me this time! [SpongeBob drags Squidward back into the bedroom. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick at the Chum Bucket bathtub]
SpongeBob: Well, Squidward, in your dreams, you can flick the switch, and you can go home and miss your friend for all eternity. I promise I won't be late. [turns off the light and kisses Squidward]
Squidward: [gasps] Oh, yes, yes, yes, you're right, SpongeBob. The bathroom is the best one yet!
SpongeBob: And the worst one yet, is this. [tries to pull off his pants, but could not] This looks like a job for... [pulls them both down to fit, as he jokes]
Patrick: Oh, no, SpongeBob, you're a genius! Look at this! [points to chum dripping from window]
SpongeBob: Oh, this, well, this is horrible! [throws the chum spatula at it, causing it to break through the window, and land on Squidward]
Squidward: No! No, no, no, no, no, no vulgar... Squidward, that would be tacky.
SpongeBob: He can't sell his chum. He has to sell his chum. [laughs warily as he leaves the bathroom]
Squidward: Get me out of here! [screams] This is exactly the sort of thing I'd do if I were your friend. [gets up] You're not a friend, are you?
SpongeBob: Of course I am.
Squidward: And you want to hang out with me?
SpongeBob: That would be a great time to do just that. [laughs]
Squidward: Oh, what would that be?
SpongeBob: [laughing] Oh, umm, hang out! [laughs] Love, Squidward.
Nat: What's this?
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward, what's going on?
Squidward: Come on, me Neptune. Let's go. [Squidward slams the door in SpongeBob's face] Darn! When are our next meals served?
Nat: I hope so, because on the day, the critter family wait in long lines at the register. [The bell rings] Next!
Fred: My leg!
Sally: The family, what's next?
Fred: [screams] My leg! My leg! My leg!
Sally: My friend!
Fred: What are you doing?
Sally: I came to save you from your dunking me in the dunking pool! [holds up a lollipop] I promised she I'd be one of them, and I made a promise with the only friend I ever held dear, that I'd do everything in my power to make sure she never flies again. [Fred gets up]
Fred: You're not going to fly again, are you?
Sally: No. Really, really. I've got to make myself useful again.
[Bubble transition]
SpongeBob: Gary, what could be wrong with a goofball like you? Especially one as silly as you. [Gary eats his cone. Bubble transition to SpongeBob in his bed at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Gary, there's something inside of me that doesn't want to fly. It's me secret anger! It's everything I ever wanted and more! [Gary's stomach growls] And now I'm going to try to make it all right, when I push Gary off my bed and walk three steps into the darkness and back into the light. [slowly steps into the darkness] I'm going to need your help, buddy. [takes a deep breath]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Look, Gary, I'm beginning to see things from your side. [Gary's stomach growls. SpongeBob walks into the darkness, and gets sucked into the darkness again] Gary, you're alive!
Gary: [egg-shaped] Meow.
