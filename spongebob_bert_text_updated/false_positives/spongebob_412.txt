[The episode begins with live-action footage of icebergs appearing.]
Narrator: Ah, observe the majesty of the mighty iceberg. [items on screen move and sound like an orchestra playing notes] Epitaph: [Pointing to iceberg] The largest iceberg ever to g reach into the ocean. [pointing to a portion of the ocean that is only available to the very strong] And sink like a mighty giant. [Pointing to a large portion of Bikini Atolls island] And now, for your entertainment, [longs for the day when he or she will break] you will be dazzled, [pants after seeing a shipwreck from another direction] ...here, shipwrecks. [pants] Next stop: Bikini Bottom. [shakes his or her foot] Oh, yea, nay, yes, I will... [gasps] Huh? Uh, hello. My name is Sherlock Holmes. [walks out of the castle] Oh, that. [laughs] The greatest shipwrecks ever. [walks back in] Nothing happened to the Bikini Bottom freighter. [laughs] The captain's never there. [gets between the anchors and looks at his clothes] My white underwear! [rips his underwear] Are you okay? Oh, I'm too young to go to the biz! [the ship is about to break up]
Warden: Dismantle him, ma'am. And don't come back until you're married.
[the scene cuts to the exterior of the Bikini Bottom at night. The freighter, which was under the bargeshell, is asleep. It wakes up and sees Sherlock Holmes in a fairy outfit wearing a helmet and holding a bucket of eggs.]
Warden: I don't know what you're talking about. [the freighter drives up into Bikini Bottom where it set course for Bikini Bottom. The scene cuts back to the ship] Okay, you caught us. Out of my world!
[the scene cuts back to the ship where SpongeBob and Patrick are standing in the middle of the water where they found the freighter.]
SpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick. I said we is for waddington.
Patrick: Uh-huh, I think she's for barnacle shiner. [he and SpongeBob start snoring loudly]
[the scene cuts back to the ship]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [waving their hands in the air] mermaids.
[the scene cuts back to the ship]
The Giant Mermaid Man: [speaking nonsense and laughing obnoxiously] SpongeBob! Patrick, did you hear?
Patrick: You mean I got to be curled up in this little box.
The Giant Mermaid Man: Well, you could play with that. [closes the box]
Patrick: I always wanted to play with my cheese-coated tin cans. [closes the box]
The Giant Mermaid Man: Well, now that you're gone, I guess there's no place for me in this world!
Patrick: D'oh! Come back!
The Giant Mermaid Man: I'm not going back. I'm not welcome in this, I'm not welcome in this, I'm not welcome in this! [closes the box]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [knocks the giant mollusk out of his body] Hi, neighbor! Hey! Are you a Mermaid Man and Living Mermaid Man?
The Giant Mermaid Man: Actually, SpongeBob, we're both living in a nightmare!
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
The Giant Mermaid Man: You don't even have a house in the neighborhood of Bikini Bottom. [crying]
Patrick: SpongeBob, is that so?
The Giant Mermaid Man: Yes, it is.
[the scene cuts back to the Bikini Bottom at night]
Patrick: Morning.
SpongeBob: Dah! I'll never find me place of rest. Dagnabbit and his flying Dutchman are just some undersea folktar.
The Giant Mermaid Man: Ah! I once searched for a lost ghost within. Now I'm going to teach him how to fly. [He takes out a mirror and looks like a ghost.]
SpongeBob: [waving his ghost] Welcome to the Flying Dutchman's house. Won't be long now, my mortal enemy the Flying Dutchman. How's about we go back to our own world?
The Giant Mermaid Man: No time now, stranger. Ya know the Flying Dutchman's ghost will haunt us!
