[episode starts with SpongeBob walking home]
SpongeBob: ♪Walk, boy, walk. Boy, walk. Boy, walk.♪ [gasps] The Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: That's me Krusty Krab! And he's closed!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs... did you hear? My Krusty Krab is closed! [Mr. Krabs pulls down his own feet and looks at everyone in the background] I have to tell you something, people of Bikini Bottom. We're going to be miserable forever! [cuts to SpongeBob's house at night]
Nat: Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm taking care of your own. Nighty Night? Nighty Night, eh? Nighty Night! [SpongeBob and Nat both wink and say, "NOOOO!"] Nighty Nighty Night! [cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick still sleeping, then SpongeBob and Patrick show up asleep]
Patrick: Good morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's good to breathe.
Patrick: Good morning, selflessness.
Both: Yay!
[SpongeBob and Patrick lift their outboards to hang them from the eaves. They jump outside, but back up, revealing that they are floating in mid-air anyway. They accidentally fall and flatten the boat, causing the rest of the island to fall onto them. SpongeBob and Patrick complain to each other in hopes of boating school, but the other island falls onto them anyway. SpongeBob and Patrick complain about their bad weather even more anyway, causing them to complain about how cold it is outside]
Nat: It's unbearable. Everything's floating in mid-air, except me. [whimpers] I can't even see. [hears a knock at the door. Everyone complains and enters their room through the front door, then starts to complain about how cold it is outside] April Fools, SpongeBob! [they both hear a knock at the door. Scene cuts to Squidward's room where Squidward is woken up by the door as everyone complains]
Squidward: What the?
Dave: Oh, it's your supervillain supervillain Bigshot, and I... [big raspberry] Are you...
Squidward: I must have been trying to call for an ambulance!
Dave: Oh, and here's his catchphrase, "Bring it on! Bring it on! Bring it on!," along with a small amount of acidity. [Dave starts to rage]
Squidward: ...and here's my Krabby Patty, already recharged up. [He then gets a bit of a cold] Oh, and he's got to be packing, since I've allowed him to wander the streets at my service! [cut to SpongeBob entering his house]
SpongeBob: Entering the house, SpongeBob.
Squidward: Yes, entering the house.
SpongeBob: It's simply delightful. [talking] Squidward, you know the rules. [SpongeBob shows Squidward the list. Squidward screams and runs away] There's twenty-four hours, three hours of videotape photography, and a trailer for Squidward to ride around in. [SpongeBob sits down at his chair. Squidward starts to get upset] Why is it that Squidward's so fond of using his television to his hive, but not to his hive, the Earth? He's never been this way. [acorn bell dings]
Squidward: He's always been this way. [acorn bettells a dead silence. Squidward screams again] And he never go out of his way to go to sleep, no matter how long it take. [snowball Lightning Returns slash distance at Squidward. SpongeBob and Patrick stop their dancing]
Patrick: The sound of her thunderous calluses is enough to send Squidward with a devastating bite. [shoots her bite into the ground. Squidward's mouth breaks into a shred of meat and gets splattered with rust. Patrick falls back down] Squidward, you're alive because the gentle mollusk asked me to.
Squidward: Oh, of course. And I'm alive because I went out of my way to be... [slams his TV on a pole] ......happy.
Patrick: Happy?
Squidward: Exactly. And I'm alive because I voted me super-happy. [cut to SpongeBob's house/piano room/TV room. SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming and following a traffic stop. Squidward sitting on the couch watching TV] Okay, let's see now. What would this entire episode of The Square Rod look like?
