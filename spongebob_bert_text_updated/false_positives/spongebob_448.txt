[episode starts with a western sky]
French Narrator: Ahh, another fun, sunshiny eleventhec. Click to hear. [the sky turns into a view of the ground, birds chirping, SpongeBob takes a picture, then cut back to Squidward taking a picture, then SpongeBob takes another picture, Squidward takes a Picture, then cut back to the picture]
SpongeBob: Enjoying the sunset? [opens his front door] That's the point. Why don't you just walk along and say hello to Squidward?
Squidward: Attagirl. [closes the front door]
SpongeBob: Thanks. [walks along and dances around]
French Narrator: Interesting your... [SpongeBob gets another picture of Squidward's face] ...hemors. [Shows that the sun is shining on Squidward's reflection, then cuts to a still shot of SpongeBob with his picture on a wall] Well, that's all I got. After my break, I can't take all the portraits, so I like to take a break now and think. [laughs] So, if you'll excuse me, I'll be going to the moon sometime on my vacation.
Squidward: Thaa... [flashback to Krusty Krab] 
SpongeBob: Squidward? Told ya I can't work at the Krusty Krab. Now what are you going to do?
Squidward: Wait for Mr. Krabs to say.
SpongeBob: Hmm... [flashback to Squidward coming out of the freezer with his steak] 
Squidward: I can't take it anymore! I can't take a break!
SpongeBob: Here I come!
Squidward: Huh? Now what? No, wait. Why? I don't understand. You didn't tell me I could't take a break, had I? He called me a liar? No, I didn't. [back to reality] I can't do it. I can't take a break. I must pass my beauty test.
SpongeBob: Great! Then who knows what I can do?
Squidward: Well, now that Mr. Krabs is gone, I guess I'll have to pass.
SpongeBob: You pass?
Squidward: A solid, thank you!
SpongeBob: I pass!
Squidward: Then who knows how long this will last?
SpongeBob: Tell Mr. Krabs I say nice things about Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Things can't get any nicer. I've got to say nice things about Mr. Krabs! About me! About the customers! [barges into SpongeBob's house and starts to cry] Those were the best hours of my life. [crying] They sure were.
SpongeBob: How long are you going to keep crying?
Squidward: Tell them I'm sorry.
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Sure, anything you want. [SpongeBob starts to cry and swallows all of the ice cream] 
SpongeBob: Okay! Thanks, Squiddy! Here's your ice cream. [cries harder]
Squidward: Calm down, SpongeBob. Don't you understand that you can't cry when you're losing, right? 
SpongeBob: Yeah, you can't cry when Mr. Krabs is gone. You've got the AVERS-AROUND here! Now, Squiddy, get in the boat! [SpongeBob gets in the boat] Whee! [Mr. Krabs jumps in the boat, and Squidward runs out of there] Come back, Squiddy! Num-num-num-num-no-crosswords! [Squidward looks, and sees two crossed words crossed up] Squiddy, what was that? [crossed words look similar to each other. Squidward looks at his watch and screams]
SpongeBob: Umm, hello. I'll catch up with you later.
Squidward: Move it!
SpongeBob: Naw, nah. [winks that he will be whisked to Mr. Krabs' house, but he is. He makes it]
Squidward: Alright. As you know, an extreme case of cry-omechanic personalityism, the undersent has been absent for the last hour. [SpongeBob continues to cheer Squidward up, but soon the doorbell rings]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: What?
