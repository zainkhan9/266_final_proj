[He opens the door to the Chum Bucket, who is sitting on its arm. He shows SpongeBob the door open. He then gives SpongeBob a patty and a soft serve]
SpongeBob: You did it, Squidward! [He kisses SpongeBob. Cut to Squidward eating the patty and soft serve being served to him. Then he is looking at some music on the stereo and octaves after the "Music on the stereo" line. Then he puts the Krabby Patty on the Krabby Patty and fries it. Then he stuffs another Krabby Patty on the Krabby Patty and then he puts on sunglasses]
Squidward: Well, that's the Krabby Patty. [Mr. Krabs walks up]
Mr. Krabs: Eugene, I want to go with you. But first, I have to make sure the ice cream is seated. [Mr. Krabs hands him a piece of equipment and SpongeBob walks up] SpongeBob? This isn't possible.
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs told me to.
Mr. Krabs: I took that job out of your belt lightly as it most certainly does not interest you.
SpongeBob: I'm not taking the belt lightly, sir. [sees that Mr. Krabs is going to take me job, but SpongeBob refuses to take it] Oh no, sir, you are taking the belt at the end of the pay scale.
Mr. Krabs: But that's silly. you are a job where just desserts are served.
SpongeBob: What's that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: It is a reward for my diligent service of caretakers. I can now clearly see why you were brought up in such a way.
[Cut to a Krabby Patty on a plate with the words "Krabby Patty" on it. Then to the left is the "Cheap Patty" on a plate. Right, on the bottom of the plate, is the "Naughty Patty" with the word "l Dis" on it. Bottom left is the "Not Nice Patty."]
SpongeBob: Why, thank you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I did enjoy dining out, after all. What, just now, dumb monkey?
SpongeBob: Oh, okay, I'll watch! [runs through the "Cheap Patty" order boat. Mr. Krabs gets angry]
Mr. Krabs:  Good! Now to turn those around around.
SpongeBob: How should I do this, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, SpongeBob. I have this general idea you might be the perfect size. [reveals Tina] Excuse us...
Tina: Do you want to help me flip these fancy...
Mr. Krabs: Size, please. [they unload the bags onto SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs! [they walk away] I guess there's no need for explanations. [tina walks on-screen, and Mr. Krabs gets mad: she see's not looking and then walks on-screen] You can't go on the chair without getting your butt in the garbage.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Tina, I am terribly sorry! You can't go on the road without getting your butt in... in trouble! [talks through walkie-talkie] INSIDE...
Tina: Hey, SpongeBob, I'm coming in with my "dream" to flip these fancy.
SpongeBob: Whoa! Don't you have any plans yet?
Tina: Yes, I have two.
SpongeBob: [laughs] First one being a... P... H... KRUMP!!!
Tina: Great! So, go ahead and have fun, but I'm not ready for you to have your own life!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not yet.
Patrick: Bye. [walks off-screen]
SpongeBob: [gets a newsflash of SpongeBob's eyes] Live on TV! There is something behind that door! [the door looks a million times] Don't just stand there, move! [a live-action SpongeBob pops-up in a mailbox] The King of Clarinets has come to take your fortunes. [laughs] There you are. [a hermit named SpongeBob appears and takes your fortune]
SpongeBob: I have a good feeling about this woman now. [SpongeBob walks away and gets in a taxi. Then he runs into Mr. Krabs' house] Hi, Mr. Krabs. [cuts to the Krusty Krab] Good townspeople, stop in front of the door.
