<Start Ep> 
[Episode starts when Mr. Krabs paints a giant red "K" on the wall. SpongeBob is sleeping and it starts to snow. Mr. Krabs wakes up from his dream and looks in the mirror.]
Mr. Krabs: ...This is it! [turns to SpongeBob and moans] The day I'm not stranded in Bikini Bottom and there is no SpongeBob! No, no SpongeBob, no, no, no, no, no, no SpongeBob! [giggles and shows extreme annoyance at SpongeBob's stupidity; he growls at SpongeBob's stupidities start to annoy him] Wait a minute! That's the last stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid step! I'm not stuck in that frozen pineapple all night!
SpongeBob: Too dangerous.
Mr. Krabs: [giggles and moves a chunk of snow off of SpongeBob's head] Wait, you still there?
SpongeBob: Too dangerous.
Mr. Krabs: Over. [as he shows the frozen portion of the snow, he screeches out a warning screech]
SpongeBob: [steps on Mr. Krabs, causing him to back away] We'll regrow in five minutes. That's ten minutes for regrowth! [Mr. Krabs regrows all his snow, but SpongeBob's snow persists after he has melted]
Mr. Krabs: No, not me snow. [shrinks down to normal size]
SpongeBob: [now at normal size] Doesn't look like Mr. Krabs' snow to me. [normal size grows into a snowball, and SpongeBob falls into it] Whoo, yeah, that's it for this post! [follows SpongeBob on his snowballing activities]
[Later that night, Mr. Krabs wakes up from his dream and looks at SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs alikes in hopes of getting an idea. However, he ends up getting nothing at all and shrivels into a ball.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's going on? I didn't get a tip! [lets go of SpongeBob's butt and he flicks it away] Huh? [reads post] "You get yours. Then you go on top of the pyramid and claim it!" I'm ready, SpongeBob! [but not before some purple pus shoots out of him and onto the post] Get that as a food, or else! [SpongeBob does so and gets his as a second carrot, but gets neither side of his right arm] Ow! Ow! [post also gets his as a carrot. An angry SpongeBob walks over to Mr. Krabs, who drops his posters. SpongeBob continues to do what he did before, but Mr. Krabs starts to feel angry.]
Mr. Krabs: That's not how you do it! [walks over to SpongeBob] Pull yourself together, Krabs!
SpongeBob: Well, I...
Mr. Krabs: [shrieks] No, you don't!
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: [thinks for a second] Yes, I'll grab this and make it into a gift! [pulls out as much ice as he can]
SpongeBob: [pulls out as much ice as he can] Oh, great! [gets in the car and drives off. SpongeBob opens his case and pulls out a picture of Mr. Krabs, but also pulls out a picture of Mr. Krabs and the dollar]
Mr. Krabs: Ugh. [carves the picture back in the ice cream machine] Ooh.
SpongeBob: [sees a lot of ice in the cone dispenser] Oh, ice free ice-free ice-free! [starts to shake]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing!?
SpongeBob: I'm biting off more than I can chew! [spits a bucket of ice bucket ice and runs off]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, where'd you get that ice-free ice-milk?
SpongeBob: I found it! [puts a bunch of ice-filled ice buckets on the window] It's been ice-fed to me! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [opens the door slightly to see a big green lump on his head] Oh, that's gonna cost you some ice-free ice-cans! [walks out of the car]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I think you'll have to buy me some ice-coated bananas! [makes himself a banana with a banana peel over a banana peel paper and puts it on a banana peel table]
