SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, I must've just finished "The Sixth Sense." 
Patrick: SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob: [getting angry] How could you?! 
Patrick: SpongeBob! You stole my "The Sixth Sense" and... 
SpongeBob: It's the most realistic, smartest, scary supervillain I've ever seen! 
Patrick: It's... [almost gets hit by Sandy's boots, but they put her back on] So, again, I'm... I'm sorry. 
SpongeBob: I don't feel so good. 
Patrick: You did. [both put Sandy on her knees, then begin to cry. She starts to get up and spin on the floor, before hitting her lower self again, this time with a fan. She starts to top out again] 
Sandy: Howdy, y'all. 
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Hooray! 
Sandy: We're sea-horsingaway...
Patrick: Huh? 
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Hooray! Hooray!
Sandy: Huh? [trips and falls over] 
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Sandy, we'll get your autograph. In the meantime, you should be good touver. 
Sandy: [surprised] What's that? 
SpongeBob: Hooray for what? 
Patrick: See ya later, Gare Baby. [leaves] 
Sandy: I'll just be on my way. 
SpongeBob: Bye, Sandy! [both go back to their seat and Sandy tips over the screw, causing the fan to trip on Patrick. SpongeBob snaps her wand, which makes TomTom cry] 
Sandy: SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob: Mother, for heaven's sake! [Sandy makes the boiling oil soap, which is pink with green goop, flow onto Patrick. Patrick starts to cry, and the green goop turns into green goop and makes Sandy mad. She makes tears and blows her nose] Yee-haw! [after some crying, they both walk off the stage and go to bed] 
Sandy: Is that what it says on the nose, SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob: Nope. 
Patrick: I'm sorry, Sandy. I just don't understand. [Sandy looks at them, and makes an angry look. SpongeBob and Patrick look rather upset] 
Sandy: Well, that's the problem. I'm not the only one who's been confused. Everyone's been confused over who the goof is. [they start to wail] Before I became a supervillain, the name was used most often, but it got changed to... P-A-N-F-H-Y! [Done In the Eye] Sandy?
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: P-A-N-F-H-Y?
Sandy: SpongeBob, Patrick, tell me! What's with the old band-aid?
SpongeBob: I don't understand.
Sandy: Why not change it to... [Covers ears]
SpongeBob: Ah, now it's Sandy.
Sandy: Wha-what's that?
SpongeBob: "As a goof, Sandy loves goofing around. The little girl you see today is No SpongeBob." [Sandy fixes No SpongeBob] There? Hm. Yes, there is a lot of moving around.
Sandy: Well, how did you find No SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I found him on the top of the stairs, he's probably been around before. [No SpongeBob hides behind a tree]
Sandy: SpongeBob is by nature giggly. He likes to throw himself in the mix.
SpongeBob: Well, in that case, Sandy, let's get outta here here this time.
Sandy: I don't know Sandy, you're not a clone. What are you doing? 
SpongeBob: I found No SpongeBob.
Sandy: Huh? [notices No SpongeBob] What? You're not No SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Wink, wink, wink, wink, wink, wink, wink.
Sandy: [shakes her head] I have no idea who you are, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I know you're trying to destroy me, Sandy. But until that happens, I'm not leaving this building. [clock goes backwards one minute] 
Sandy: Huh? [Spotlight: Sandy's teary eyes shown. As the crowd of people are watching, a helicopter turns around and flies away]
