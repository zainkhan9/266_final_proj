[The scene switches to SpongeBob's house where he notices a squirrel running around. He grabs him and runs over to the window. When the squirrel sees SpongeBob sleeping with him on, he wakes him up.]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward! It's only SpongeBob! [The squirrel grabs SpongeBob and drags him out of the house] Safe thing to do! [The squirrel attempts to strum his guitar, but SpongeBob pulls it and the squirrel starts strumming.]
Sandy Cheeks: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yes? Sandy?
Sandy: What's all the rumba-doo?
SpongeBob: What's what?
Sandy: Oh, I just saw what's on the horizon, Miss Cheeks.
SpongeBob: I see you. [Takes off his sunglasses and scratches the back of his head] I see ya. [Scratches his body and fixes it back on] I see you.
[Sandy walks over to SpongeBob's pineapple and places it on the top floor. SpongeBob is groaning of his inability to sleep.]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not any sleep. [His eyes bulge and explode.] Oh, what am I so scared about? [An alarm clock appears on the screen.] We're all out of snorkels, SpongeBob. I've got a rash all over my face. The doctor says I have an allergic reaction to oatmeal. [An article about an allergy attacks SpongeBob. appears on the screen.] Ah, I finally get the hang of it. [blows the alarm button and the alarm goes off. SpongeBob's body begins to swell and he is placed in a ball.] I'm starting to get the hang of it. [He starts to shed some of his normal skin. His body also grows some more. His body becomes bigger and starts growing some more.] I'm finally getting the hang of it. [He is put in a bowling ball and it's attached to a wooden bat.] I'm finally getting the hang of it. [It's attached to some sort of gong. It's trying to escape and it spits on SpongeBob. It then growls and destroys a door.]
[Patrick angrily angrily scatts his pants.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: How long've you been scatting me?
Patrick: Two days.
SpongeBob: Maybe we could go out and scavenge.
Patrick: Maybe we don't have a bowl full.
[Patrick throws the bowling ball at SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob and Patrick both throw it back but there is a crunching sound.]
SpongeBob: [tears up and faints] Oh, now's a good time to take a look at your junk. [scratches his junk bowl]
Sandy: [off-screen] Hey! Where ya going?
[Sandy turns her desk chair around and heads to the kitchen. SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen with a bunch of junk in his hand.]
SpongeBob: What's in the kitchen?
Sandy: Oh, just stuff like that.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Sandy. I think I've found the one thing that'll help me run this business.
Sandy: SpongeBob? How about you help me concoct a solution of this crisis?
SpongeBob: Oh, what do I need?
Sandy: Well, I'm not sure.
[SpongeBob notices that Sandy doesn't seem to be listening and thinks for a bit.]
Sandy: Maybe I should ask around. [sees SpongeBob in her room] SpongeBob? Uh, I think I might need something to this.
SpongeBob: What about a consult with my doctor?
Sandy: Oh, that's just what I need. [closes her bedroom and walks away]
[SpongeBob notices that the mess Sandy has made is all cleaned and done.]
SpongeBob: Where's Sandy?
[Sandy looks at the mess Sandy made and becomes disgusted. She quickly goes back into her bed and pulls herself out.]
Sandy: All right, fine. Whatever. Let's just get out of here.
SpongeBob: Oh, well. At least I still have my sanity. I guess I won't be needing this anymore. [gets kicked out of the Krusty Krab and goes home to his family] Well, there's nothing like a to-go meal at home. [walks along with his family and goes to sleep] Yeah. Yeah.
