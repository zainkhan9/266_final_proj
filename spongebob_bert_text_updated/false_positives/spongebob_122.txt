SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, ready for work!
Squidward: Huh? Well, I'm not here! [cries] Why?
SpongeBob: Why, why?
Squidward: Why, why?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, why, why, why? [raspberries]
Squidward: SpongeBob, I want to go to the park tomorrow.
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir. [goes into the Nativity]
Squidward: I can't. I'm stuck in the middle of the street. [inspects SpongeBob] Look out! [knock on the door; SpongeBob walks over]
SpongeBob: Oh, it's Neptune! He's here to see the Statue of Liberty! Oh, boy! Let's get outta here! [SpongeBob pulls a wall of the Nativity and goes backstage at the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob follows the signs]
SpongeBob: Heyward, want to come with me?
Nat. Nutt: No problem, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is grossed out and is unable to walk the rest of the way] Why, thank you. [everyone else is disgusted by SpongeBob's stupidity] Why, hello again!
Nat. Nutt: Why, hello again!
[SpongeBob notices people laughing]
SpongeBob: Uh, hello? [One is holding a sandwich and the other has head and eyes of a different race]
Nat. Nutt: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Don't laugh, SpongeBob! We're trying to go to the Chum Bucket! To the Bucket! To the Bucket! [touches fist] Well, actually, that's a great idea. Hey, what's with the shoe?
SpongeBob: [chuckles] I always wanted to ask that same guy. And if you sneeze on the shoe, they'll... [SpongeBob notices a creature with a shoe on its feet]
SpongeBob: Shoe on my feet? You shoe is a natural!
[SpongeBob tries to say something]
SpongeBob: [chuckles] I get it, Gary. [the creature gets angry] I get it, Gary! [pokes the shoe out of his ankle and kicks him over and over] I get it, I get it, I get it! I get it! I get it! I get it! I get it! I get it! I get it! I get it! [the creature gets angry and jump away while SpongeBob continues yelling and laughing]
[Squidward walks up]
Squidward: All right, Squidward, you know the answer to that question. Has anyone seen the Statue of Liberty?
SpongeBob: [crying] I don't know what did happen, Squidward, the shoe was on my ankle.
Squidward: Well, uh, the shoe was on my ankle?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
[SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, where Mr. Krabs is looking at the monitor. He then faints.]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you for this patient, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: It's a little boy who... I dunno, who... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Mr. Krabs: Stand down.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. Uh, it's about time you got here.
Mr. Krabs: Time sir, what is this?
SpongeBob: Get on with it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean it isn't about time? It's about the money.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you said it!
Mr. Krabs: [growls] What did you mean it isn't?
SpongeBob: It's about... money.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] Money?!
SpongeBob: Assignment. I don't understand. You're in charge of me business.
Mr. Krabs: Eh, good luck. I don't want to be the manager who makes the money, boy.
SpongeBob: Until next time, management's not in charge.<|endoftext|>Rep. Debbie Dingplein (D-Mich.) on Sunday blasted President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be acting assistant to the president, saying the pick is "a radical departure from the image of the president we know and love."
