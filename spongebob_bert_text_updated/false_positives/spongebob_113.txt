[The episode begins with Patrick watching TV while SpongeBob knocks on the door with a hammer]
Patrick: My, what am I watching? Why are those two acting as if there's no tomorrow?
SpongeBob: [whispers to Patrick] Are you sure you want to give up tomorrow?
Patrick: No, what am I sure is?
SpongeBob: [whispers to Patrick] Keep working on your karate chanting and karate clams. Don't let go until you have 100%.
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob: [whispers to Patrick] KaaAAAAyyyyy!
[SpongeBob breaks through the door and knocks on the door again. Patrick breaks through the door and knocks on the door again. SpongeBob breaks through the door and knocks on the door again. Patrick breaks the door]
Patrick: Yes, master? [SpongeBob breaks through the door and knocks on the door again. Patrick breaks the door] Yes, master?
SpongeBob: We've got to get back to the Krusty Krab. We've got to get back to stealing the Krabby Patty formula.
Patrick: But what about the formula itself?
SpongeBob: It's a ripper, Patrick. A ripper on the offensive. What about the history you want to tell? [cut to Bikini Atoll, where SpongeBob and Patrick are wearing kilt-ends and hats]
SpongeBob: The story of our love lives like none other. [SpongeBob and Patrick talk about their love of hijinks, hijinks, hijinks. Then they start to hurl the items at each other making loud music]
Fish: Wha... what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Our lives are in your hands now. The mystery of how we got here is beginning to look a lot like my own. My enemies... [hears something outside, changes the words "unauthorized"] ...me. Us.
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: We're having a pirate convention!
Squidward: Oh.
SpongeBob: Don't you want to play the game? It's a wonderful time for everyone.
Squidward: I'm not enjoying this convention.
SpongeBob: No. Why ruin it?
Patrick: You try to ruin it?
SpongeBob: I tried. In fact, I'd like to ruin it forever! [SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward are wearing purple and green hats] I've been trying to tell SpongeBob to knock, don't knock! Encino's the new Encore! [SpongeBob and Patrick are wearing the purple and green hats. Squidward is wearing the green hats] Paterson's the new Encore! [SpongeBob and Patrick are wearing the yellow and pink hats] Dorsal Dan's the new Encore!
Squidward: Don't you ruin it?
SpongeBob: I'll ruin it forever! [SpongeBob and Patrick are wearing hats with the words "I like SpongeBob" on them]
Harold: Oh, do us a favor and get us out of here!
J. Crew: You're unsanitary.
Pirate: We want to know how to fix it. [Holds up his binoculars and a magnifying glass]
Harold: What?
Pirate: Get back to the town!
[Holds up his binoculars and a magnifying glass]
Harold: What?
Pirate: We want to know how to fix it. [Holds up his magnifying glass and a smaller magnifying glass]
Harold: What?
Pirate: We want to know how to fix it. [Holds up his magnifying glass and a pink umbrella]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Pat?
Patrick: I think we should do this ourselves. [Holds up his binoculars and a magnifying glass]
SpongeBob: Then and there, do us a favor and let us go home.
Patrick: Let us go home?
SpongeBob: That depends, me. Do you want to play hide-and-seek?
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: [Sees a large walkie-talkie, which has a camera and a microphone in it] Oh, that's where I like to hang out. [Takes the microphone] And I like your favoriteâ€”Mermaid Man, huh?
Mermaid Man: I like you, SpongeBob. I call you Mermaid Man.
