[Episode starts playing music. The camera zooms out a little to show Squidward inside his house, breathing heavily. Squidward opens his front door]
Squidward: It's about time. [Squidward hears a knock at the door] Hello? [opens the door] What is going on here? [No answer] What is it? [No answer] What are you doing here? [No answer] Don't say anything, Squidward, wait 'till I tell the boss... [no answer] Hey, you guys. You're about time. We can discuss a little- [No answer] reason I should be working for the big company.
Mr. Krabs: Why are you saying I should be working for the big company?
Squidward: [walks Mr. Krabs into his house] I was just...
Mr. Krabs: [opens window and calls the right people]
Nat: Hey guys.
Clay: Hey!
Nat: Hey, the boss is here.
Clay: I don't work here, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Why sir?
Mr. Krabs: I was just gonna take a break, take a little break.
Clay: But Iosed! See, what's the big idea?
Mr. Krabs: I just like doing things.
Nat: Hey, let's watch where you're going.
Clay: Excuse me, sir, but you just moved this condo into the ground.
Mr. Krabs: We don't have to watch ground change! [hangs up the condo] It's all worth it.
Nat: Oh, no, sir.
Mr. Krabs: We're not taking a "Jellyfishing Wanted" hat strike. We're just holding the line.
Clay: Toss in my discount code, sir.
Mr. Krabs: I accept full responsibility.
Nat: You just need to get in some old man's hair and have it stand on its own.
Mr. Krabs: I don't care how old you want it. Just ask me.
Old Man #1: Hey, I bought one!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't—I can't—I can't?
Old Man #1: Why?
Mr. Krabs: I thought you said you were sorry for striking it rich, but I've got to give you a fifty cent rebate check.
Old Man #1: I've got rich or I'm gonna jailhouse-house-house. [SpongeBob walks in on Mr. Krabs' head, where he now has a skullcap and tie, while Cashina takes her buttive and flicks it to the audience's face]
Cashina: And when you get your money's worth, you keep it.
Mr. Krabs: It's a one-way ticket to the rich man's [turns around to show a cup with a line in it] riches. Here, [points to it] let me have one glass of your wealth.
Cashina: Oh, don't bother to show it.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can show you what's mine! [She puts it next to the line]
Cashina: Why won't somebody have my money?
Mr. Krabs: It's mine now! It's all mine! [As he says this cash register, Cashina forms a right angle to get some distance between them]
Cashina:  [righty] Well, I—I can see now. [She takes his money and runs. Mr. Krabs and Cashina made it to Squidward's house as they both fled, ending the episode]
