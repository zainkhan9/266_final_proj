[The episode begins when Mr. Krabs, who is now in his bathtub, hears the squeaking of the sea bunny. He opens his bathtub door and looks out through his window. Then he looks out through a shower curtain to see the sea bunny hopping up and down in the stall behind him.]
Mr. Krabs: Look out, Bikini Bottom Oyster, there's a maniac out there!
[The sea bunny looks up and mumbles in surprise. The sea bunny creeps over to the front doors of the Chum Bucket and grumbles to Plankton about the incident.]
Plankton: [Under his breath] That's funny. That's funny. I was just “feeding' the bunnies bread' [The sea bunny grumbles] and all we had was the Krabby Patty. [The sea bunny looks at the employee and growls in anger] And that was it. That's when I discovered [the] Holy II back here! [The sea bunny looks at the remains of the Krabby Patty and grumbles in anger] [In slow motion, a shell falls off the bottom of the Krusty Krab] That's right, Eugene. I was taking the bus. [The sea bunny grunts angrily at SpongeBob as he goes over to the grill]
SpongeBob: Wait ‘Baby Name, please. [The sea bunny grumbles in anger and slaps SpongeBob on the back] 
[The sea bunny slaps SpongeBob on the back again. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs working at the Chum Bucket. He is having the night shift as night light. The next day, Mr. Krabs hears loud music in the background of games]
Mr. Krabs: [Walking out of his office, he sees a light switch on his desk] What's that? [He looks up and sees a building] Oh, the Krusty Krab.
[A certain Mr. Krabs comes out from the office]
Mr. Krabs: Home run! [He runs over to the Krusty Krab, past SpongeBob, and knocks on the front door.]
Patrick: [Off-screen] Where am I? [Mr. Krabs opens the door] Mr. Krabs, you lost your job, so I'm taking your job.
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing here?
Patrick: Oh, it's a job. You get a choice. You either work for the Krabby Patty Co. or you don't.
Mr. Krabs: We don't have a Krabby Patty anymore, so you can't order us a Krabby Patty.
Patrick: Oh. That's the bad side of things, Krabs. I like the old Krabby Patties. I don't like the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: Don't say anything, Plankton. I'm counting on you to make this a success.
Plankton: Oh, I don't wanna, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you can't be serious. We've got to get this all over the wall.
Plankton: Oh, I can't be serious. I don't wanna do that.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Plankton. Look. [The scene shows a large wall, just like the door, with Mr. Krabs' picture on it. He turns to SpongeBob and writes, "KK" on the wall.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, it's my pleasure.
[SpongeBob covers his mouth as if he's giving Mr. Krabs a piece of his mind.]
Mr. Krabs: That's a great idea, SpongeBob. I'll be in the Krabby O'Monday Times for all you know and hear.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we should be working right out there. [He hears SpongeBob's voice over.] It's "Krabs and Friends"!
Mr. Krabs: You don't understand, SpongeBob. I got a gig out of no less. [He looks at SpongeBob who is by some sort of camera and has a more human face.] I want you to be Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Krabs. Please.
Mr. Krabs: What am I doing?
SpongeBob: I'm excited.
Mr. Krabs: You're gonna do it.
SpongeBob: And you're gonna do it on camera.
