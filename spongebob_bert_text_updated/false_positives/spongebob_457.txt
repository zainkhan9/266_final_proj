SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Do you mind telling me how to get to the exit? It's easy. Just... [slowly] ...don't touch the exit. Are there any difficulties?
Squidward: Now all I need is the most quiet and serenity-free... [gets unclothed. Scene cuts to Squidward's house where SpongeBob is laying on the couch]
SpongeBob: Here's your bass drum...
Squidward: Yes. [claps twice] The drum is laying on the couch.
SpongeBob: [screams] The drum is on the couch! That's the couch! That's where your bass drum is drumming.
Squidward: Why do I need this?
SpongeBob: It may make you feel better. [spins around on the couch] Tummy! Tummy, Tummy, Tummy! Tummy, Tummy, Tummy, Tummy!
Squidward: Tummy? No. [pokes his head through the window and pulls it back] Tummy?
SpongeBob: No, tummy... I don't like you.
Squidward: Ugh. [walks out of the house and into the living room]
SpongeBob: What are you doing!?
Squidward: If I can't win, I'm gonna... [sees SpongeBob doing a wedgie to Mr Krabs' head] Ooh. I think we should do that.
SpongeBob: But you said you were lonely.
Squidward: It was a pretty good idea before the times.
SpongeBob: I can't believe I said that.
Squidward: Fine. Say, if it's not your dream.
SpongeBob: But I can't not only have... [sees Mr Krabs' ukulele] But you have to be happy.
Squidward: Are you really that lonely?
SpongeBob: Huh? Squidward? Squidward? Every single one of those miserable failure stories? We're all alike.
Squidward: Well, I'm not.
SpongeBob: But you're a very special cat. Squidward, you're the only one that's been around long enough to know that I'm a special guy.
Squidward: Special? I've been there, I know everything there is to do with being a special cat. [picks up his cat] It's as if the universe is his, he shows up every time, he's like a magnet. [pushes SpongeBob and jumps in] I can't believe I ever said anything about being a special guy.
SpongeBob: [takes off his hat and puts it around Squidward's neck] You don't believe that?
Squidward: No. [walks off]
SpongeBob: And if you think that I'm a special guy, forget about it. [Squidward falls down]
SpongeBob: And if you think that I'm a special guy, remember what I said about the universe being his, he's my... your... [ankle falls off his torso. SpongeBob screams] The tail! [SpongeBob yelps. SpongeBob pulls his torso up in the air and lies back in his chair] Forget about it. [screams and pulls out his clarinet] I can always count on the unicorn. [continues screaming then falls and hops on top of Squidward. SpongeBob and Squidward get up, but the unicorn is still there] I can never take it. [slithers to the unicorn and its mother]
Unicorn Mother: Oh, hello. [The mother hops ahead of SpongeBob and Squidward as the horn blares. SpongeBob and Squidward get up.]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, my stitches.
Unicorn Mother: Whyâ€”okay, it's over, now?
SpongeBob: [hops to the door and tries to open it] But, I can't. [the door opens and shows Squidward, SpongeBob, and the unicorn mother sitting on the other side of the door] I can't even go in.
Unicorn Mother: Ooh, there's your tickets. [shows Squidward's tickets]
Squidward: What? How can I compete with this unicorn? [the horn blares and the place is as tall as Squidward's head]
