[episode starts with Plankton inhaling the air]
Plankton: Honey, I'm full. [episode ends] 
[the episode's title reads cryptically as "Missing Identity Evacuation". SpongeBob picks his head up]
SpongeBob: My, Patrick. My, in barnacles. [SpongeBob's pineapple starts to crack and fall, making him scream and fall flat on his face] My, Patrick, we've gotta find Patrick. 
Patrick: [wakes up] Huh? What was that? 
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob. Patrick, one of my first duties. 
Patrick: We can do this. We can do anything we want. We just need fuel. [places his head on the table] Anything we want. 
[SpongeBob takes his hat off and puts it on his head]
SpongeBob: Alright. Let's go. Patrick? 
Patrick: Hold still. [SpongeBob pulls his head back, but the antennae on his nose flies off. Patrick tries again, but gets the same result. He drinks the fuel, but the antennae on his nose flies off. He then drinks a big glass full of water] Why, thank you. [drinks a big glass full of water] Thanks, SpongeBob. [drops his drink and runs back to the table] 
SpongeBob: Just keep your nose clean. I'll be back.
Patrick: Okay. [takes off his hat and puts it on top of his head] 
SpongeBob: And don't even think about asking if you should be a member of the Bikini Bottom Police Department. 
Squidward: Hey, you're a member? 
SpongeBob: Yes, I am.
