[The scene changes to Bikini Bottom, the episode begins with Patrick watching TV in his pineapple house.]
French Narrator: Ahh, Bikini Bottom. The gnarliest time of the season.
[Patrick is sitting in his living room watching the news on his television.]
French Narrator: And on the front page of Bikini Bottom News.
[Patrick comes into the house.]
Patrick M: Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it. [Patrick talks to himself through the TV] I'm Patrick. I call myself Best Friends with You.
[Patrick starts playing a game of pool with one of his friends.]
Patrick M: That's my turn! [pong ballens with power and score a try â€” the French Narrator cuts to Patrick's house] Well, at least the weather was good. [he hears some roaring from his window] Rain showers next Tuesday. Huh? [pong balls down to his window] Rain! Rain! [wailing] Rain, rain, rain! [a river of grief comes to his window]
French Narrator: Meanwhile, Patrick's wailing continues.
[Patrick mumbles angrily and runs back into his house. Power goes out and some of it then goes away. An image of Squidward getting hit by a truck's front windshield comes to mind.]
Squidward: [dazed] No!
French Narrator: Meanwhile, Captain Scarfish of the Bikini Bottom Island is still calling his tug, which is supposed to be doing its medical checks.
Squidward: Alright, captain. This is where I come from. I'm a doctor, and all my medications are side effects of sad, painful, illegal and even illegal psychedelic drugs. So, what's the doctor saying?
Captain Scarfish: [in a French magazine] Toulouse-Lautrec... [translated literally] La-la-la-la-la-la. [his voice echoes, and he runs out of the hospital]
Patrick M: Hey, SpongeBob, you got something serious?
SpongeBob: I sure do! My name's SpongeBob SquarePants!
Patrick: I'm sorry, doctor! Mush! Mush! Mush! [inside his head, SpongeBob hears some meows outside, and he gets out of the hospital wearing bandages and a yellow bandages wrap around his head]
SpongeBob: I'll protect you from the crazy stuff, if you don't want it! [he goes to the door and opens it, and comes back out with it covered in green ice cream patties] Ahh, ice cream prunes. And they're so good! [he starts to eat the patties] Oooh! they are so good! I know I do! [SpongeBob starts to jog, and starts to walk around, and even starts to sniff the air] I do!
Patrick M: Hey, jog!
[SpongeBob is so tired he has run off and on and on and on about Patrick's house, and about Patrick's sea urchin friend]
SpongeBob: And then one by one, one the sea urchins come and come and ween-wugs, and ween-wipes, and tell us to go back to the parking lot! [Patrick mumbles angrily and hits the parking lot again]
[Patrick mumbles and runs off, this time with an umbrella]
Patrick: Hey, wanna go play hide-n-seek?
[Squidward opens the window and sees Patrick playing with  his ersatzies, which are fancy  things that someone with a fancy voice like Patrick does. One ersatzie is a girl's guess, and Patrick has picked it]
Squidward: Well, if it isn't my masterpiece. [walks out] Who wants to play?
SpongeBob: Yeah, anything's possible.
Patrick: Eh, what'd you say?
Squidward: How could you say anything? I would say... [accidentally releases car keys onto the ersatzies]... queasy body! [shuts the ersatzie]... pointy ears! [slams the ersatzie]... wig! [carries the ersatzies out of the car]
SpongeBob: You were right. I would never want to leave this place. I know what's best for my people. I'm going to make them happy. Oh, I know what that feeling like. [she lays a ball on its head and it starts dancing around] That feeling is what I want. That feeling. [the ball turns into a wig and laughs]
Patrick: That was fun. Bye, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick. Well, back to work.
