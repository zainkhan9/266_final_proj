[Scene begins outside the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Now as I was saying, I please have some tea.
Squidward: Well, I must say you have exceeded expectations. You look amazing. [hands SpongeBob a box]
SpongeBob: And look what's inside. [points to SpongeBob's house] Wow!
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, Squidward! [kisses him] You are a real pal. [continues kissing him] Do you get it, boy? You're a real phony. A real phony... A real phony!
Squidward: [raspberries] Mmm, gimme that cup of tea.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, you're so alive and well that it is almost comical.
Squidward: You do?
SpongeBob: Well, do you have to come back here to party?!
Squidward: But how?
SpongeBob: Well, I must say, you've been a real pleasure, and I'd sure love to go back and party again, 'cause I'll be so soon!
Squidward: Wait! I've got no further right to complain about!
[At SpongeBob's house, Mr. Krabs and Squidward are going to have a little fun, and Mr. Krabs is going to give them one too. He is going to put his hat on, and then he is going to put his head on it and he's going to drink it.]
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, me hort called out loud. SpongeBob, come back. I said, "Squidward, come back." And I went back to work.
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: You're supposed to come back. [Squidward is going to the door and plugging away in his machine]
Mr. Krabs: Don't you know it's a long, lonely road, Squidward? The only road... [winks] with people I can trust... [tears up] friends I can be around forever.
Squidward: Wait.
SpongeBob: You're supposed to come back. [SpongeBob tears up again]
Mr. Krabs: Now if you want me to  shift the blame for this on Krabs' superior machine, then should I?
Squidward: Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, are you? Are you coming back  or you're just waiting for a different 
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you can't go back!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob, you don't understand. I'm not your boss.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: Go away, buddy. I can't afford to have you there.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I don't need you back there.
Mr. Krabs: It's not about you, you shellacking crab! You don't need me back there! You're already here!
SpongeBob: You wanna go home?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. [doorbell rings] And just to prove it, [SpongeBob runs away. Mr. Krabs sighs] SpongeBob will do your talking, won't he? [Mr. Krabs sighs] Okay, goodbye.
SpongeBob: goodbye... [camera turns to reveal Krusty Krab] the Krusty Krab. The finest establishment in town cuisine. [doorbell rings $5 million] 1 more round of renovations? And to prove it, the place's a mess, too! [Krabs sighs] You know. [happily] Yeah. [camera pans to reveal The Krusty Krab] the most fancy establishment in town, and it's all broken. [doorbell rings] And, what's with the leaky roof? [camera pans to The Krabs] The Krusty Krab. The Krusty Krab. The Krusty Krab. [Krabs sighs] Where's SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Oh, nothing's going on here, I'm just breaking in. Have you seen... [shines a rainbow over the Krusty Krab] ...anything...?
Squidward: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey, Squidward, [snaps his fingers] I'm not paying you to fail, you're just here. [walks away]
Squidward: And I'm sorry, but I've failed you.
Mr. Krabs: [smiles] Oh, hey, Squidward. What's this? Gee, you think this place is the Krusty Krab?
