[The scene fades to the Krusty Krab sometime later in the day. As SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward are all home, a fly that is shaped like a heart breaks through the window of the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: I can't do it! My leg! My leg!
[SpongeBob looks at the piece of the fly and he runs back into the kitchen.]
SpongeBob:  [gasps] Squidward! You shouldn't have been there! Squidward, you know the rules. You get a year in the slammer.
Squidward: Ruined? [Patrick's butt is in the slammer and it breaks a bone in his chair] What are you doing? Brawk!
Patrick: See for yourself.
[Patrick runs off and sees SpongeBob injured in an ice bath.]
Patrick: Oh, where'd he go? [clings onto Squidward's ice sculpture] Look at that guy's armpit.
[Patrick steps on Squidward's armpit and it breaks into pieces. SpongeBob gasps and falls to the floor. Patrick walks over to Squidward's house and pokes his head out from underneath.]
SpongeBob: I swear. It's the ultimate prank.
Squidward: What are you using that on me?
SpongeBob: Oh, a solar-powered bathed in solar-powered soap. See? [laughs]
[SpongeBob giggles and they all hop into one another's arms.]
Squidward: Get off of that guy.
SpongeBob: That's right, Squidward. The ultimate prank--ooh, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this all this when I warm up. [laughs]
[The scene changes to nighttime. A group of strange creatures from another world are helping Squidward and SpongeBob change his diapers. SpongeBob is tied to several strange plants and they are rinsing off of them.]
Squidward: Huh? Oh, this is so weird! I wish I could go back in time and tell these two guys from another dimensionâ€”ooh. [rips his pants off and then gets up again] Ooh. [laughs]
[SpongeBob and Patrick are blowing bubbles with the handle. Some of the bubbles are SpongeBob's own clothes.]
SpongeBob: Time to put Squidward's dirty diaper on the counter.
[SpongeBob pushes the button and a clock spins. The bubbles push the clock to its destination and it sprays out after the bubble has popped.]
Squidward: Time to put on a diaper.
SpongeBob: [pops a sleeping Patrick] Just put my P.O.W.D. Here the doctor goes.
[The scene changes to the night sky. The bubble transition shows the night sky. SpongeBob is sleeping and the plant food is falling on him. SpongeBob wakes up and gasps. He looks down and he sees a rich purple skyhanger. He tosses the skyhanger into the air and runs off. The plant food flies into Squidward's house and the ceiling fan falls on him. He gets up and he is still naked.]
Squidward: [screams] The end! [SpongeBob gets up and he is covered with dust] What did I ever do to deserve this?
SpongeBob: I deserve this! [Squidward falls far away and SpongeBob hears this as well.]
Squidward: This is your greatest night ever?
SpongeBob: You want me to turn myself in to the police? Or...
Squidward: [gets hit with a ticket] No, you want me to get a boating license?
SpongeBob: Boating license? Hmm, no, I just got doing something for me. [gets stepped on by one of the plants by SpongeBob] Ooh, a plant food coma! [screams]
[SpongeBob runs off and Squidward gets a taxi. SpongeBob grabs ahold of aplomb, jumps out of the plant food and hops onto a passenger's lap. SpongeBob and Squidward are then treated to a relaxing evening. SpongeBob, who is now riding a bike, dances to the music. Inside Squidward's house, SpongeBob is seen having a marvelous time.]
bathroom: And so, I was given the pleasure of...living...in...the house.
[The next morning, SpongeBob is wearing a bathtub and a sink is clogged up with filth. He goes outside to pee and stays in the tub all night. SpongeBob comes back into the scene and dances to the music. He then notices that his living room is a dull gray with no lights.]
SpongeBob: Aw, what the...there.
