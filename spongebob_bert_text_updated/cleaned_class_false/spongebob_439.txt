[The episode begins with Patrick watching a movie. He is shown outside on a TV-shaped screen.]
French Narrator: Ahh, a lovely day for photosynthesis. Admitting it's time to be Heretic! [Patrick laughs]
Thaddeus: Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey.
SpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick. If Heretic One were to step foot on the road like this, he would be crossing a wilderness free zone. [points to a road] There he would. Why, he's astride a cliff, hissed, bunting, a cowboy hat, and, of course, his rainbow bridle. [Patrick walks up with a red and white towel around his neck]
French Narrator: The story of Heretic One isles. [Patrick is shown but a very yellow fish points to him next to a green and white tent] When a recently returned monster stepped foot on our...
SpongeBob and Patrick:?!
Fish's head: [points to green and white tent] Hey!
SpongeBob: We didn't show that to him! He drew us to believe!
Patrick: Let's draw pictures of all the monsters on the road!
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Fish: How many?!
Green Tentacles: [points to most fish on the road] One!
Red Tentacles: Two!
White Tentacles: Three!
[Green and white tentacles are shown both left and right]
[Green and white tentacle #1 draws a trail of green ice and draws a dot on the screen as the green ice melts. As the second fish draws, the screen moves to a blue field.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Huh? [Barnacles, the third fish draws a conch drawing and Barnacle, the fourth draws a Frank, drawing Frank, the fifth draws a Bill, and so on]
[The last fish draws a conch drawing and Barnacle draws another circle.]
SpongeBob: Why would Heretic One attack so well?
Patrick: Because he has the...
SpongeBob: the rainbow bridle?
Patrick: the rainbow bridle!
Green Tentacles: [points to Barnacle] Hey!
Barnacle: [angrily] Look at all the trouble that would follow. If you think you can take part, you're fooling someone.
[Barnacle pushes SpongeBob and Patrick off the screen. SpongeBob and Patrick start to fight each other.]
Fish #1: Let's scale down this mountain, Barnacle! We're gonna need more water!
SpongeBob: Don't make me say this harder to hear.
Patrick: But that's impossible! If a monster had to shape reality in your favor, that's just wrong! It's why Mermaid Man and Barnacle are so afraid!
SpongeBob: If a monster had to make you give away everything!
Patrick: Oh, that's okay, SpongeBob. He just has to be hungry and thirsty.
Fish #1: He does.
Green Tentacle: How many times do we have to remind you that you are our creator?
SpongeBob: Actually, I...
[Green Tentacle throws a watermelon at Patrick. Patrick whacks SpongeBob.]
Patrick: Watermelon!
[Patrick and SpongeBob stop running. The scene shows up at the Krusty Krab where the Krabby Patties are still in the bag.]
Mr. Krabs: So, with these skillset, you can make anything happen.
SpongeBob: What do you mean with anything?
Mr. Krabs: What's that in your buns?
SpongeBob: Let's get out of here, Mr. Krabs.
[Mr. Krabs quickly gets rid of the bag and it slides back inside SpongeBob's body.]
Mr. Krabs: In that case, SpongeBob, you'll need...
SpongeBob: [in a trance] Will you help me?!
Mr. Krabs: You'll never get it. It was all a misunderstanding. I>.
[Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob out of the restaurant. Scene cuts to the night where SpongeBob wakes up at his house in the middle of the night with bandages on our noses.]
