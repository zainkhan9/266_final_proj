[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is singing to workers]
Mr. Krabs: ♪Squidward always keeps his vow. And I'll let you all know by lunch time. If I can somehow somehow somehow somehow manage to glue patties like these to these Krabby Patties...♪ [Cut to lunchtime. A bell rings]
Employee #1: One Krabby Patty, please.
Mr. Krabs: All right. Two Krabby Patties, please. [Mr. Krabs breaks off the bell. He gives the order to the customer]
Mr. Krabs: You know, back in elementary school, before I opened this—
[ bell rang again. Mr. Krabs opens the cash register. Gasps] Me first.
Krabby Patty: What the? [ he takes off his hand. The Krabby patty bounces on the bell and gets counted out. Krabby patty sings to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: 97, 98, 99, 100.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, let's see. That's it, boy. There's no need to panic. [ both work together to solve a puzzle. They climb out of the problem and run up to Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, help!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, boy, help! [ they do so. The solved the puzzle and then we see an elderly woman who over 60 is stuffed with coins]
Wobbles: I knew it! These coins are the secret currency of the Chum Bucket. I could have them all over my uniform. [ from the movie The Exorcist: The Musical Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are playing, they had to shareapt the coins with Mr. Krabs. The coins then roll out of the Chum Bucket into a rolling machine]
Mr. Krabs: [ from The Star Trek cartoon The Krusty Krab The crew of the Titanic are riding in a chum bucket. We then see SpongeBob working. He is stitching a breakfast sandwich together by hand. SpongeBob rolls the sandwich on a purloined napkin. On the stack of napkins roll off a card that says, "This is a Success Story!"]
Nathiel Waters: It's a success story, Sir.
Mr. Krabs: [ from The SpongeBob SquarePants movie SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are playing cards] There you go.
Nathiel Waters: It's a success story, Sir.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, we all just learned a whole new lesson.
Nathiel Waters: I didn't.
Mr. Krabs: Not a single dime.
Mr. Krabs: Nuh-uh.
SpongeBob: [ from The SpongeBob SquarePants movie There's a lot of money in the Krusty Krab and Mr. Krabs is in need of a new headquarters. Mr. Krabs has a mess hall, elevator, and even office supplies that looks like it could be used for a while. Mr. Krabs needs money for the elevator supplies SpongeBob. So, you take a ride on the future state of the art air-cooler tower. [ Mr. Krabs walks away. The scene returns to the present time capsule where SpongeBob is looking around the time capsule with a suitcase. Mr. Krabs walks right under him and starts to "get" the time capsule.]
Mr. Krabs: I think we better go to Pinewood!
Pinewood: No, it gets worse.
Mr. Krabs: Time to bulldoze past you. Tau...uh... [shouts.] Time to... peel... past you... [thinks it's a crawly worm] I mean, a crawly worm! A crawly worm that likes company. [ looks down and screams as he falls to the floor. Cut to the present time where Mr. Krabs is still climbing up the time capsule. SpongeBob is below.] Now, this is just a phase two, you see? [ he is in his base where there is a huge sun, Krabby Patties are served, and a bunch of time capsules with time limits above are sitting at the top.] Now, what do we see here? Huh? Huh?
SpongeBob: Here's your base now.
Mr. Krabs: And now, Pinewood!
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that is the funnest time I've ever had!
Mr. Krabs: Well, if it isn't the most popular time ever.
Squidward: And besides, how could anyone want to stop me... [ starts to get angry ] SpongeBob?
