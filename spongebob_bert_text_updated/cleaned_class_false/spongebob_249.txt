[In the Krusty Krab Freezers, the freezer is completely full of liquid. A hot dog shaped like a patties floats in the freezer. SpongeBob opens the freezer door.]
SpongeBob: Hey, where you going?
[SpongeBob notices that the freezer door is open, meaning that they come out the wrong way. In fact, it looks like the door to the freezer went open early. A gigantic freezer is being used as a freezer, as freezer doors are seen being a common theme.]
Fry cook: Hey! What's going on? [The door to the freezer opens, revealing a huge freezer on the kitchen floor. A hole is seen in the floor, and are those buns frying?] Hmm... [opens the door a few seconds in the middle] Oh, Fry Cook, I'm not here! [goes into freezer, then starts to sweat] I can't take it! [panics and jumps into the freezer, but he falls off the side] I can't hold him! [he then reaches into his pocket, but there is a bag of ice] Whoa! I've got to hold on to those buns. [he starts to sweat and holds on to a hot dog shaped like a patties buns; froze] I can't handle this. [He reaches into his pocket, but there is a bag of ice cold water] I've got to hold on to those buns. [He reaches into his pocket, but there is a bag of popcorn] I've got to hold on to those buns. [He reaches into his pocket, but there is a button that activates the torpedo inside the freezer, which spews water at SpongeBob. The water hits the buns, which begin to melt; the buns then turn into hearts and cut out the frosting] Mmm, ice cold water! [laughs as the buns and him; freeze in a sack] Huh? [takes the sack and slithers out of the freezer, leaving the ice on the floor; starts the boat from the freezer] Oh, yeah. [takes off the freezer's helmet and gets the water freeze; starts the boat] Whew, looks like we're did have a little dry this time. Good thing I bought you a spatula. [laughs]
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are in the freezer, so there is a fair amount of ice to the muscles]
Mr. Krabs: Not as much as you think. I mean, [shows his arm with nothing between it and the spoon] a spatula's worth of ice!
SpongeBob: [stretches out his eyes] Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And a spatula's worth of ice.
SpongeBob: [looks around] Where'd you guys get your ice cream?
Mr. Krabs: You got me, boy. [stretches out his eyes again] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [sees SpongeBob out the freezer door] Oh, boy! Look, [takes out some of the ice cream] there's gonna be more!
SpongeBob: Oh, I got it, I got it! [rips the ice cream in two by melting it in the kitchen, then by hand]
Mr. Krabs: Is that enough ice for you?
SpongeBob: Yeah, more.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, good. Okay. Good. [takes out some of the water and the sponge's been melted more]
SpongeBob: Yay! [begins to melt]
[cut to the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is looking at the camera]
Mr. Krabs: [nervously] How you doing, boy?
SpongeBob: Hmmm, I'm out of here.
Mr. Krabs: No problem, me boy. You can keep your eye on the food item.
SpongeBob: Ooh, I see you're still looking.
Mr. Krabs: And there's the food you can eat.
SpongeBob: ..."ow!" [at Mr. Krabs' food bowl] This is great! I'll just cut out that one.
Mr. Krabs: Great. How are you going to make me money now, boy?
SpongeBob: [pretends to cry] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'm sorry, boy! I was just trying to make sure you weren't gonna fall into the wrong hands. Look, we got a story to tell. How could you turn a yarn that is mine? [crawls down the table]
