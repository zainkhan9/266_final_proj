[The episode starts when a live-action cherub falls off a cliff through the street not far from the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪I've seen enough, I've seen enough, I've seen enough, I've seen enough, I've seen enough!♪ [cut to a live-action close-up of SpongeBob's, Mrs. Puff's face] ♪I've got my reasons, I've got my reasons, I've got my reasons, I got my reasons, I got my reasons♪ [then a shot of SpongeBob's, Mrs. Puff's face is shown.] Why are you so quiet? Because you can't... dare... CATCH IT? It's that dull, monotone voice that makes you want to cry.
[Then a shot of SpongeBob's, Mrs. Puff's, or even Squidward's]
SpongeBob: ♪I've got enough to live, I've got enough to go to the park, I've got enough to live in a nice, relaxinghouse,♪ [normal voice] I've got enough to live, I've got enough to sleep in,♪ [hypervoice gets tighter and tighter until it becomes impossible to move a single button] I've got enough to live, I've got enough to eat in,♪ [hypervoice stops and becomes louder until it becomes louder still] I've got enough to live, I've got enough to bathe in♪
[Then a shot of the front of the Krusty Krab is shown, with a huge gold star on top of a patty and splashes water on it, then it becomes shiny again]
SpongeBob: ♪I've got enough to live, I've got enough to breathe in,♪ [then a shot of SpongeBob's, Mrs. Puff's, or even Squidward's]
SpongeBob: ♪I've got enough to live,♪ [normal voice again] I've got enough to eat in,♪ [hypervoice again becomes louder and becomes even louder until it becomes louder still] I've got enough to live, I've got enough to bathe in♪
[Then a shot of SpongeBob's, Mrs. Puff's, or even Squidward's]
SpongeBob: ♪I've got enough to live, I've got enough to bathe in♪ [SpongeBob gets really angry, and starts crying] I've got enough to live, I've got enough to eat in,♪ [normal voice again] I've got enough to live, I've got enough to breathe in♪
[Then a shot of SpongeBob's, Mrs. Puff's, or even Squidward's]
SpongeBob: ♪I've got enough to live, I've got enough to bathe in♪ [SpongeBob gets even more angry, and starts bouncing around until he hits the ground, causing him to start bouncing away and crashing into a fence]
[Then a shot of the Krusty Krab is shown, and we see SpongeBob still being tazed around the office]
SpongeBob: ♪I've got enough to live, I've got enough to eat in,♪ [SpongeBob goes berserk, and starts going really fast]
[Then a real close-up of SpongeBob is shown, and then he is still going really fast]
SpongeBob:  ♪I've got enough to live, I've got enough to eat in,♪ [SpongeBob gets really fast, he hits the wall repeatedly, causing it to start again, and he goes berserk, constantlyotting himself repeatedly hitting the wall repeatedly... twice... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly...
Door to the restaurant: Inadequate. Inadequate in that they don't have time to prepare the meal in time.
SpongeBob: I'm telling you about restaurant hygiene, SpongeBob! [shows the infected area of the Krusty Krab]
[Mr. Krabs opens the door]
Mr. Krabs: Goodgiene! Uh-oh. Kind of, uh, uh, uh... well, let's see, uh, how'd the meal go, uh, over the weekend?
SpongeBob: [shows the meal in a bucket] Oh. Uh, over here.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] What's so funny? I mean... [he points at the bottom of the meal] ...no. [he pushes the meal into the ground and puts it in a large plastic bag] There.
