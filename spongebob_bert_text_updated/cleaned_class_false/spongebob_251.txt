Patrick: Bye, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [gasps] The Chum Bucket...heh. Let's go get the secret formula again.
Squidward: SpongeBob, you promised me a formula, blah blah blah blah blah.
SpongeBob: [inhales, starts crying and then starts humming]
Squidward: What? You're not going to the Chum Bucket?
SpongeBob: I'm not going there, I'm going to Plankton!
[Squidward jumps off the building, onto SpongeBob's face, and starts crawling on him.]
SpongeBob: Squidward...will you get off of...me?!
[SpongeBob finally pulls him off, and Squidward gets off.]
Squidward: This is too hard! It's worth a try! Let's...[squish his face with his hand] um...[squish] cleave to a new formula!
[SpongeBob struggles, and begins to push, a button. He reaches for the button, and it falls, and the button breaks]
SpongeBob: My, what's that? 
[The button then flicks the Chum Bucket button, and all of a sudden, a big, red, glowing, gas starts flowing out of it.]
SpongeBob: That's fantastic, Squidward. I've been looking forward to trying my new look. What better way to demonstrate my new look than by having a chum... [gasps]
Squidward: What in Neptune's name is going on?
[SpongeBob shows a maggot trap. Maggy gas rushes in, and it spewes green gas. SpongeBob screams, and jumps, and he kicks a rock, and he kicks a rock, and he kick two rocks, and he kick a rock, and he kick a rock, and he kick a rock, and he kick a rock, and he kick a rock, and he kick a rock, and he kick a rock.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you're alive!
Squidward: Well, what are you screaming about? Looks tasty.
SpongeBob: I want chum...[laughs]...and I want to taste it!
Squidward: I don't know how you're going to explain to a ten-year-old how to eat chum, even if it's a secret formula!
SpongeBob: I know you want to explain, but I'm a bit of a no-good... [laughs] ...Scooter!
[SpongeBob runs away, scared.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, please explain to me...
SpongeBob: That...phrase...is wrong. [spins of words around, then stops, and turns around] Shh, it works! You'll get over your fear of making people talk funny.
Squidward: [laughs] What are you going to do, show me your powers? [gets out of his sandcast hand] Shape-shifters? [spins of pants again] Protein shakes? [spins of pants again] Quakes? [spins of pants again] Fist drops? [spins of pants again] Diodes? [spins of pants again] Lip drops? [spins of pants again] Tylus...uh...[laughs]
[SpongeBob pulls one of the holes in Squidward's head, and it falls off. SpongeBob walks up to Squidward, and he gives him a tray with a patty on it.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty.
Squidward: Well, that's something. Have you finished enough?
SpongeBob: [squish] A Krabby Patty. [licks lips] Okay, Squidward, get on there. We've got hygiene and home cookin'.
Squidward: [screams] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[SpongeBob shapes Krabby Patties into a hamburger, and they go into the food. SpongeBob puts a piece of meat on each patty and fries out. Then, he puts a fork, and it goes on the patty.]
Squidward: [screams] Urrgh, [screams] More pimples.
[Meanwhile, SpongeBob is at Home Cooking and he's cooking up a delicious Krabby Patty with all the spices he picked up earlier. He pours the spices into the patty, which has a lemon zinger, and we see a little kid eating the patty.]
Little Kid #1: Okay, Grandma! Just don't eat it until you get here!
