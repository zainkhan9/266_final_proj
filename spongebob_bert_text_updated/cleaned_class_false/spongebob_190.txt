[At Conch Street. Patrick is walking Home Scratchy as usual, then he notices an Old Man in the bathtub]
Patrick: Old Man! [He sniffs the water, then he sniffs the water again] SpongeBob! Where is that? [Walks up to the bathtub, but when he takes the sponge and sniffes it, the air was all that was left] Wasn't that great, Patrick? 
Old Man: [scratches his head] My skull is fine! Look at all those extra eyes!
Patrick: [looks at his make sheet and bites on the make sheet] Must've been close, I'm sure. [Bubble wipe to bed. Opens the door, then pants]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick. You were right. Great work. [flicks the light switch and lets the music resume. Music starts to play]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow.
Patrick: We can't thank you enough for this. Let's get Loading Star7!
SpongeBob: Oh, you promised Squidward you'd get him ready for his flight back home. So I'm gonna start him off by tearing him apart! Let's do this! [puts a small chain chain circle on Squidward's door. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick who sit together and do simple things] Just make a hole in the wall. [cut to SpongeBob and Patrick who are doing simple things together] This should make Squidward proud.
Patrick: Why don't you just make some temporary filing cabinets for his stupid little house? [SpongeBob shows Squidward a painting]
SpongeBob: This reminds me of the painting Squidward did for Old Man Walker. [shows Squidward the painting on painting.net]
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward the painting again] I don't know how you did it, but Old Man Walker was just too dumb. [shows Squidward the painting Squidward already knows how the Krusty Krab works. Cut to SpongeBob also which is a picture of Old Man Walker with a bunch of cards on his desk]
Patrick: [shows Squidward the painting] Yeah!
SpongeBob: [makes a hole on Squidward's wall and tickles him] This is what we should do. [walks back to Squidward] This should fix everything.
Squidward: Actually, I didn't listen to what you said. [his nose grows back] Anyway, you fix everything and I'll go get my therapist once she gets her license.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. [laughs]
Patrick: And I Know Why You're Here...'s... Alright! [Crying]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is crying over Patrick. Both hug] Oh, Patrick, you're loved. [cries harder]
Patrick: [notices SpongeBob lying unconscious on the ground] What now?
SpongeBob: [snaps fingers] Tying Up...
Patrick: Gently...
SpongeBob: ...Touching Up...
Patrick: Dang SpongeBob! [Ties the doodle up]
SpongeBob: ...Sticking A Finger Up There And You're Still Coming For It...
Patrick: Whoa... Stop Bad Pressuring!
SpongeBob: Where Did We Go?
Patrick: We Got There This Time...
SpongeBob: Done! [Both sob really loudly]
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're together, we're together... [Squidward sits up] Well, how do we get outta here? [Crawls down the street]
Squidward: This is pretty rough.
Patrick: It's still pretty rough. We're not completely censored.
Squidward: Oh, that's absolutely awful. What are you going to do about it?
Patrick: I'm not going to go near that doddering jellyfish of yours!
SpongeBob: But, but, but, but, but, Squidward, you're being naughty. You don't understand that they can get very cranky!
Squidward: Eh, forget it. [Scene cuts to the phone ringing inside SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, time to text Gary. [types the phone number] Gary! I heard there was a missing snail in town. You need me to help you search?
Gary: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
SpongeBob: No, no, no, Patrick. Gary said he was missing and he couldn't get to you.
Patrick: [Goes back] What's wrong, Gary?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You guys search too hard?
