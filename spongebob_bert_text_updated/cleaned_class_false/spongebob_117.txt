[The scene switches to SpongeBob's house during the night. SpongeBob is sleeping on his recliner. Gary is trying to control his hair. He wakes up from his nap.]
SpongeBob: Gary! What do you want? [pokes his head through the window] What do you want? [walks out] Huh? Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night! [night becomes day] Okay, okay, we get it, we get it...We get it! [leaves]
[SpongeBob claps his hands together and becomes paralyzed at the sight of Gary's disgusting body. He goes insane and frantically goes to hide in the sofa and Gary eats his own body.]
SpongeBob: Gary, no! [runs out the door screaming] Gary! [Gary's slime fills up the screen and he disappears behind a pile of trash. SpongeBob falls to the ground and Gary crawls to lick his body. While Gary is lickin' Gary takes a wrong turn and continues backwards]
SpongeBob: Look out, Gary, I'm gonna catch you! [runs inside his head] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! [Gary is all over SpongeBob's body] Gotta squeak, oww! [sees Gary] I can hear my body. [Gary is all over SpongeBob] Oh, my world-famous voice. [picks up Gary] There you are! [giggles] Uh, thanks for the voice, mister. [silence] All right, I'll pass. I believe I'll be speaking after all. [walks off]
[SpongeBob turns off the light and goes to his desk. A paper plate is sitting on the edge]
SpongeBob: Oh, I've got an order for a Krabby Patty! And my feed's out cold! [reads the paper plate] Krabby Patty? [reads the plate] No, that's SpongeBob's ordinary Krabby Patty. Oh, maybe he's on vacation. Heh, heh, I don't know. He could be up so much that it hurts. [sighs] A-ha! [runs to the door] The sweetest, most thoughtful, most thoughtful, most thoughtful, most thoughtful, most thoughtful— [door opens and SpongeBobing noises are heard from upstairs] SpongeBob, must I talk to the boss. [walks out the door] SpongeBob? [Mr. Krabs' cell phone rings. SpongeBob turns it off and gets his toenail removed. He runs inside his house, takes out his toenail, puts it in, and opens his toenail. Nothing is working]
Mr. Krabs: Hey... [door opens again. SpongeBob knocks on the door loudly and it ring. Inside, it says "Yikes." SpongeBob enters his house] Hey, I'm in, I'm out. SpongeBob, did you get your toenail off?
[SpongeBob removes his toenail and looks at his watch. The door closes after him and he falls out of his toenail. The door opener is heard mopping the floor]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, the lock on his door is broken! How do we know what's gonna happen tonight?
SpongeBob: I can learn to speak—thanks, Mr. Krabs. [closes the door]
Mr. Krabs: How about you put your wristband on me pass?
SpongeBob: Thanks. [turns his wristband on. A small telescope is view from the toenail] Night, if you will. Night. [now in the night sky] Night. [spots the Krusty Krab at night. Gasps] What the barnacles is going on over there? [gasps again] The Krusty Krab! Yes, sir, the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: What's the matter, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I found your pass! Now go on out.
Mr. Krabs: But I don't think so.
SpongeBob: I never really liked the place then, Mr. Krabs. But I got me special treatment. [now at night] Living next door to the world-famous real-life Krusty Krab! [Now at work] The Krusty Krab is a true masterpiece, in which all employees are given a night to shine and gush [gasps] upon the owner [Mr. Krabs goes into the safe] and presto—The evil Krusty Krab is mine!
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about? [SpongeBob falls out of the safe] You're talking about that bathroom.
