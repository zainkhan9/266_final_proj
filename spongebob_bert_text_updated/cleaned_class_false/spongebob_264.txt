[episode starts with Mr. Krabs sleeping at his counter with a "Krabs" and a "Krabs" with a "Krabs" that says "Krabs." Close up of both "Krabs" and "Krabs." The "Krabs" sweeps around inside SpongeBob's pineapple becoming a zombie-like appearance.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you zombies?
Mr. Krabs: No. Just me.
[Mr. Krabs imagines himself meeting the pop culture references of the games: a sea monster, a skateboarding sea monster, and then a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Zombie Mr. Krabs runs through the streets of Bikini Bottom, blocking all traffic and leaving a trail of destruction all over town. He passes SpongeBob and Patrick, who run up happily to see him.]
SpongeBob: Whoa!
[Mr. Krabs trips on three pieces of paper.]
Mr. Krabs: [Slides onto SpongeBob's butt] Uh. Where were you?
Patrick: [Moves his hands up and down to make it look like toes] I'm moving! [He Moves His Hands] Me? Mm-hmm. [He Moves His Hands Again] Me? Mm-hmm. [Then he Moves His Hands Again] Me? M-hmm. [Then he Moves His Hands Again] Move it! Move it! Move it! [But instead of moving it jumps onto Patrick's head and smashes into his car, leaving him pieces all over his body] Me! [Carpet wiggles Like a Flower, then on the ground covered in bits of the Carpet, along with a piece on his eye] Me! [Grows Eyes] Me! [Carpet Starts to Rumble]
SpongeBob: [Screams] Oh, no!
[Mr. Krabs removes the pieces off of himself and gives them to Patrick.]
Mr. Krabs: There you are. I need you to be my replacement.
Patrick: Uh... I can't do it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Replacement means I can't replace you, and I need you to be me!
[Patrick falls of the car and bits of flesh fly everywhere. Then he runs around, screaming. Then he dances around and appears to be doing all sorts of weird things, like holding a guitar string and then laughing. Then he runs around and appears to have sort of a life, like owning a boat rental, and is carrying a bag. Then he runs around and appears to be doing all sorts of other things, like laughing, like holding a bottle of moldy seaweed dressing, and then squirting seaweed onto a canvas. Then he runs around and appears to be doing all sorts of other things, like swinging and hitting his head on a bottle of glue. Then he runs around and appears to be building a house, and is holding some electronics boxes.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Patrick, that's some serious cool stuff you're doing.
Patrick: [Sits in the chair] You actually like weirdo-o stuff?
Mr. Krabs: Iash-for-hoor-lay?
[Mr. Krabs tosses Patrick a chair. Then he sits on a couch and eats some of the food. Then he appears to be dancing with music.]
Patrick: Ha, ha, that was a good one!
[Mr. Krabs plays a keyboard on which is shown are there two Flying Dutch Hats. Then he appears to be playing a prank on the Flying Dutch Hats with an electric guitar. Then he plays some clarinet with which Patrick is asleep. Then he appears to be dancing with the Flying Dutch Hats. Then he appears to be hollering angrily outside of Bikini Bottom Jail and SpongeBob is sleeping on the job until Mr. Krabs comes out and takes him out. Then he dips the electric guitar in his cash register and begins to play some better songs. Mr. Krabs shuts up and smiles: "You're a winner, SpongeBob! You can't quit." [Laughs]
SpongeBob: Hey Krabs, I got some real bad news.
Mr. Krabs: [Gasp] What's that? SpongeBob, you told me the right thing about the electric guitar.
SpongeBob: Oh, that.
Mr. Krabs: And what's that about electric guitar you made?
SpongeBob: That, uh, Krabs, that...
Mr. Krabs: I destroyed your life, now you're gonna buy it back.
SpongeBob: I'm gonna do it right away, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Put her there. She'll like it.
SpongeBob: You better get back travel.
