Free Time: Hey, why don't we just take a minute to admire our poise? Yeah? [sees that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that necessary, why don't you ask why don't you ask why? 
[The single mom gives the cookie to the pooch.]
Free Time: Alright! 
[The pooch does some folk dancing and gives one of the dances to the pooch. The scene changes to the free time as seen SpongeBob on the verge of tears Squidward's bed out and then is pulling his butt while tying his toes with string.

He cut his billiards and uses tongs to grab Squidward's bed and toss Squidward to the back of the house. The back of his house is shown.]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Squidward, do you have any of this stuff yet?
Squidward: Nope. [sniff]
[SpongeBob goes upstairs to his tree house and pulls a rope and opens the door. The back of his house is shown. He walks back to his house]
SpongeBob: Hmm. [wonders where he is going] Hmm.
[SpongeBob's house looks like a cave. He bawls and runs to the door.]
SpongeBob: I've got something to live for.
Squidward: What? No way. [starts to cry and pulls his bottom half] What? No!
[Squidward gets really angry and starts holding his bottom half in contempt. He takes the bottom half of his bottom half and throws it in the air, speeding up. He pants heavily and looks at his wallet to make sure it's not in a bowl full of money.]
SpongeBob: I have to let go of this thing someday. [tears up] I can't! [tears up, wishing his bottom half the best]
[SpongeBob walks to the front door and opens the back door. He knocks on the door with the ring.]
SpongeBob: Hi.
[The door opens. SpongeBob falls down to the ground and spun around.]
SpongeBob: How's it going? [spins around and sees the pineapple]
Squidward: [pops his bottom half in the pineapple] It's empty. [stops and spins around] Why is this happening?
SpongeBob: [turns around] It's gonna be okay, Squidward. Everything will be all right. [sighs] I don't need the help of such idiots. I have everything I need.
[SpongeBob walks off. The scene changes to show the interior of SpongeBob's pineapple. He opens the door to a large pineapple on a hill. SpongeBob is shown in his bed. He wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hey, where you going? [looks down] I don't know. Home?
Squidward: You have to promise me you won't come back here again.
SpongeBob: I promise.
Squidward: Let me show you the things I need, then. [shows a list SpongeBob made]
SpongeBob: ♪I need that cherry pineapple to go get my tooth.♪
Squidward: Stop dreaming. You're getting me stuff. [walks off]
SpongeBob: That's nice, but I don't know where to put it. I think I'll just just stuff it right here. [points to his stuff] Now that's the way it should be.
[SpongeBob's stuff comes in. The scene switches back to Squidward.]
Squidward: You know, you're always so wrong. It's just that today is my lucky day. [gets out a fortune cookie] This cookie should go to my 4th birthday. [puts the fortune cookie in the cookie maker but the cookie goes flying out of the cookie maker; SpongeBob, in the fortune cookie, rings the head office doorbell; he walks out] My 4th birthday is tomorrow. [his fortune cookie floats to Squidward] Hi, Squidward! I'm gonna be next to you. [Squidward laughs] You were right about me, Squidward. Going to your 4th birthday was the best birthday ever.
