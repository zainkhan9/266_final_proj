[The episode begins with the clatter of clams on the beach. Squidward is playing his clarinet when a clam caws and roars, destroying his clarinet. SpongeBob is taking care of some other boats and accidentally breaks one.]
SpongeBob: Okey-dokey, Squidward. I can hear the fun in that little boy's voice.
[Mr. Krabs is gone.]
Mr. Krabs: What happened? [gasps and gets mad] What's with the shack up everybody's heads?!
[Mr. Krabs begins to lose his sanity as he panics like crazy. He rubs his head]
Pearl: [as a little baby talking to Plankton] Oh, he looked like he was gonna cry.
Plankton: [baby talk] Oh, I thought you were the one who was going to kill me.
Pearl: [baby talk] Oh, that was me. You wanted me to take your job and do your thing.
Plankton: Well, that's what really made me cry.
[Mr. Krabs gets really angry and he pokes his head through the window and sees Pearl crying in his boat]
Mr. Krabs: [walks out of the kitchen] Hey! Go away!
Pearl: Why are you crying?
Mr. Krabs: Because I thought you were gone for a couple of hours.
Pearl: I was finally going to get back. Now,'s what I want!
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute. I thought you were the one who was going to take my job and make me cry? You'd rather be gone than be loved.
Plankton: I'd much rather be loved than be kidnapped!
[Mr. Krabs and Pearl cry in each other's faces. All of a sudden, SpongeBob comes out of the water]
SpongeBob: Hey, Pearl!
Plankton: What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: We kidnapped you and your friend Mr. Krabs to stop him from stealing my secret formula.
Plankton: Of course I'm going to prison for it. So, you give me the formula and I'll give you away. Okay, free!
SpongeBob: Good enough. [gives up]
Plankton: No more talkin' about it. Forever.
SpongeBob: You're a good friend, Plankton. I'm going to go- [takes off his pants and cackles] Forever. [he sobs over Plankton] I can never go back. [hears another commotion in the kitchen. A wanted man yells at a plate of patties]
Man: ransom! [runs out of the kitchen]
Squidward: What's going on here?
SpongeBob: There's a man who wants me back. [waves his arms and legs are out. he then gets up and puts his cape on] There's a man who wants to take me job. [he then gets up, takes a bath, and sits in his chair]
Squidward: [wakes up] Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. [snickers] Don't worry, little man. I'm an out and that's all.
SpongeBob: What's going on here?
Squidward: It's mind-boggling. There's a man who wants to take me job.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's a great idea!
Squidward: Well, I don't need you, I can ride with you all day or I'll mop it all down.
SpongeBob: What makes you mop it?
Squidward: It's what Mr. Krabs calls 'the mop-take!'. [jumps on SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: Well, ol' Squidward, I think that's a good idea.
Squidward: What does that mean?
SpongeBob: It means I'm an out and that I like taking people with them want and I think that's great!
Squidward: Well, well, well, what do you mean?
SpongeBob: It means that if you don't get my boat, then I don't get your boat!
Squidward: Wonderful. Wonderful! Wonderful! Have you got any batteries?
SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward, this stuff is on the up and up.
Squidward: [angry] I got all these things but no-ho, no-ho! No-ho! Get 'em, burn them or just save them?
