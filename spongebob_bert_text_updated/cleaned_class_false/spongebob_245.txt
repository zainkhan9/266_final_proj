[The episode begins with a swim in the Bikini Atoll.]
French Narrator: Ah, the exotic beauty of Bikini Bottom. Oh, the memories and the thrill of a jellyfish. And of course, the painful memory of a man drowning.
Dream SpongeBob: Yes, dream meow, Agnes.
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Mr. Krabs: Agnes!
[SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Mr. Krabs appear to be floating in the bubbles, and they are shaking]
Dream SpongeBob: You're welcome. [they both clap] We've got a date.
[Suddenly, the screen shows an alarm clock as SpongeBob's head spins due to the weight of the episode's food.]
Dream SpongeBob: Neptune's moon Triton is throwing a giant storm. That means your Krabby Patty is stuck there.
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Mr. Krabs: Triton? [the screen shows the Bikini Atoll] What do you got? Throw a giant storm?
[The scene changes to show Plankton floating through the streets of the Krusty Krab, trying to sneak over by running.]
Plankton: There's the road I come to, Eugene. [he sees Mr. Krabs, who is messing with Plankton] But this is the road, Eugene. I'm coming to that one prune.
[Plankton walks over to a street with large pruners. Eugene tries to get away, but is chased by several policemen.]
Eugenev: You know, SpongeBob, it's easy to see why you're getting so much push around in Eugene. [the policeman throws a big prune at Plankton] One prune. I don't even know where I'm going.
[Eugenev groans and pouts. Mr. Krabs is about to knock him off the bed and goes back into the safe it was plugged in at.]
Mr. Krabs: Uh, fish, I don't really got too much of a choice. [pulls out a jump-rope] Here, Eugene. Come down here. [the policeman jumps in and absorbs the jump-rope]
Plankton: Eugene, I don't think I can do this.
[Eugenev catches Plankton with the jump-rope. Eugene jumps into the rocket ship's fuel tank and starts fouling the rocket's fuel rod. Plankton floats around and gets sucked in the rocket's engine. Eugene escapes from Plankton with Plankton clinging to him.]
Eugenev: Hey, great Neptune. You stuck.
[Eugenev and Plankton float all over the screen, connected by a cord. They connect to a microwave and launch it to go to the surface. But it turns out that the moon is all but empty, and there is only one place on the moon with life.]
Plankton: [weakly] where are you? [weakly] when are you gonna get there?
[Then it turns out that Plankton is just the answer that Eugene had been looking for since his eye color dimmed. He floats up to Eugene with an air of mystery.]
Unnamed man: Hey, you!iman! Eugene had me won! I used your formula to make my first dollar!
[Soon, everyone on the moon looks up to Eugene for his leadership and intelligence.]
Chimp: I love you Eugene! My mommy has had you for years. [flies]
Lodge leader: You're the president of the moon's people! I can't believe they're empty!
Chimp #1: I feel sorry for the little empty snail.
Lodge leader: Don't do it again!
Chimp #2: It must have been in your system for more than 6 minutes.
Lodge leader: Leave it to me to find out the full truth.
[But the copier he was guarding crashed on the island. Eugene pops up from the crashed ship and cries for help from the ship's helm.]
Eugenev: Hey, hey, hey! [hides in his suit and cries some more]
Plankton: Hey, hey, hey! [crying] I came here to save you from, from this empty, meaningless world!
Eugenev: Wait a minute. Did you just say "we" and not "we'll"?!
Plankton: Well, that's a good question. I think that, in conclusion, I've come to appreciate your brand of non-intruding cultural non-assignment.
Eugenev: Yeah, I saw you on TV once talking about saving the world.
