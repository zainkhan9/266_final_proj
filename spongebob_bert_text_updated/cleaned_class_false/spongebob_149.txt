[At Conch Street, SpongeBob and Patrick are walking down Conch Street.]
SpongeBob: Huh?
[SpongeBob and Patrick make it to Conch Street where they will get stuck on the side of a building. SpongeBob pulls himself out of the way and goes back home. He sticks his tongue out and Patrick sticks his tongue back. SpongeBob makes it back and he is in Jellyfish Fields at night. He is sweating from sweating from sweating scarily from his swollen front teeth.]
SpongeBob: Oh, jolly good night, Patrick. [smells the aroma of the native jellyfish jelly]
Patrick: [screams and runs away] The King of Bikini Bottom has finally given me the mollusks a try! [jelly fumes and leads to Squidward getting thirsty]
Squidward: Oh, yeah? Well, it's all right. I'm going to get a glass of lollipop-wise. [gets stung by a fly and drinks his saliva]
[SpongeBob decides to take a glass of lollipop-ness and is instantly jealous. He goes to get some ice cream from the register. Patrick comes out from nowhere and takes the ice cream.]
Patrick: Ah! Ooh-haa! [drinks all over the ice cream]
SpongeBob: All right, Patrick, you got the ice cream. [steals the ice cream]
Patrick: Thanks. [drinks more ice cream]
SpongeBob: Wait, wait. Ice cream. You got some right? [squeezes his ice cream cone in the ice cream] Thanks. Hey, Patrick, I got a lot of ice cream tonight.
[SpongeBob grabs the ice cream from Patrick's mouth and runs off swallowing it. He slurps the ice cream in the cup and he sings to himself. He puts his tongue over the ice cream and he eats the ice cream. Now he's almost eaten the entire ice cream machine. He licks some ice cream out and he licks some more ice cream. Now he's almost done the whole ice cream machine. He's almost eaten all of the ice cream. The machine spits out some ice cream out as it dies down. SpongeBob bites into some more ice cream and he's drinking some of his own ice cream. Now he's almost eaten all of the ice cream. The machine spits out some ice cream out as well and SpongeBob is drinking some of his own ice cream. He's drinking his own drink ice cream.]
Patrick: Ah! [drinks more ice cream]
SpongeBob: Patrick! You're almost done!
[Patrick sucks more ice cream and SpongeBob is drinking some of his own drink ice cream. Now SpongeBob is drinking his own drink ice cream. But SpongeBob is drinking too much of his drink and he spills all of it onto himself. He spits all of the ice cream into his mouth and slaps himself.]
SpongeBob: Good job...
[SpongeBob squeezes some more ice cream out of Patrick's mouth and squirts all of it into his holes. Patrick's eyes bug out and SpongeBob runs out. SpongeBob runs out of the restaurant. A truck drives over to Sandy's with the other jellyfish and helps her find SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy. How's it going?
[All of a sudden, the other jellyfish hear SpongeBob and go flying into a container with the other jellyfish' food.]
SpongeBob: Sandy?
[The truck drops the other jellyfish and takes Sandy to SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob is breathing heavily now that Sandy is safe, happy-go-lucky, and well.]
Sandy: [waving in happiness] Well, you're a sweetheart, SpongeBob. What a sweetheart. [Sandy's happy-go-lucky breathing appears and her body begins to swell rapidly] Well, all right, fine. If you don't want to be a burden, I'll just ask Sandy to take care of it. [SpongeBob begins to pet Gary, who is stuck under a rock] Gary? [SpongeBob takes Gary and walks happily to Sandy's house] So, how's it going?
Sandy: [snickers] It's going great. I can now see my face. [Gary's face grows bigger]
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy. How are you?
Sandy: [waving in happiness] I'm happy.
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy! I guess all the expectations you've had are wrong. Hey, buddy, think big. Do what? Do what? How would you like to think?
