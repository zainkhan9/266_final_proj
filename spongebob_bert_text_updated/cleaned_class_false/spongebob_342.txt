[the episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick walking through Jellyfish Fields]
SpongeBob: Huh?
Patrick: Walk the plank!
SpongeBob: Walk with me, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah, walk the plank. [both walk the plank]
SpongeBob: Hike the plank.
Patrick: [whispering] Sponge it, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
[SpongeBob and Patrick both stop for a few seconds in the middle of the road. In the episode's flashback, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are standing in front of a road]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... [starts walking in] Whoa. [He starts to walk in reverse, instead of going in circles. He starts in the center of the screen, but then he stops in the center. He then goes into SpongeBobâ€™s house] Ah, there's nothing to be afraid of, SpongeBob. Nothing but pure white. [he then walks away, seeing that SpongeBob is not there.] What is it now, Gary? [SpongeBob is still screaming and running around] Gary! [cut to SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob pulls the TV off of the ceiling] I'm still here. Whoa! [screaming] Whoa! Whoa! [runs over to Patrick] Patrick, what are you doing? Why you day, you monster!
Patrick: I'm not doing this. This is my duty. I'm going to use my brain power!
SpongeBob: Patrick, your brain power! It's where your brain functions. It must be at my disposal. [pulls out a stick of hot glue and uses it] No, no, no! Put me down!
Patrick: Oh, I already said I'm not doing this. [puts his hand down] You're next!
SpongeBob: I am! [both start to throw Patrick away, but Patrick shoots his brain a hot glue ball and it liquefies. The hot glue puts out his suit, which has an air bubble in it. Now, when SpongeBob and Patrick are playing, Patrick tries to play pranks on SpongeBob.] Get me out of here! [both try to hit Patrick, but they miss and fly through the air. Now, when they're both out of the air, a huge balloon turns into a plunger, a stop sign, and three-quarters of a bricks, which are placed in the plunger, spin around like a castle. The town of Bikini Bottom is shown.]
Bikini Bottom: Hold on tight, Queens!
[Bikini Bottom police officer shows up] Queens! I wanna see her. [notices Patrick running over there] Patrick, hey there, that should be suspicious.
[Patrick jumps up and down]
Police Officer: Well, you didn't see anything, did you, Patrick?
Patrick: Uh-huh.
[Police Officer 2. who is hovering over there, notices something different.]
Police Officer: What? It's not working!
Patrick: Oh, that's not right. I... Was it the fumes?
[A piece of duct tape falls on top of Patrick. The police officer looks at the area. He sees the exit, which is actually a truck stop away from the truck stop. Patrick sees that the truck stop truck stop is behind him.]
Patrick: Where's my house?! [runs back home to his house but the unbearable loneliness makes him forget where he is]
SpongeBob: Patrick, all those years of solitude have worn off my hunger. I want to go home.
Patrick: No, SpongeBob! NO! [slams the door in SpongeBob's face] I'm not leaving! NO! [runs over to the dump] NO...
SpongeBob: All right, you don't leave the Corps. But I gotta find you a job!
Patrick: I'm good.!
SpongeBob: Sure foot, Patrick. Just start grilling these Krabby Patties. [grilling them]
Patrick: I'm good.
SpongeBob: [whole scene missing] Patrick, I'm good.
[SpongeBob looks at the kelp kelp kelp kelp. He screams]
Patrick: I'm good.
SpongeBob: [whole scene missing] Patrick, I'm good.
[Patrick starts to struggle drinking the drink. He looks down and sees that his head is pointing at the Corps dumpster]
Patrick: What's the Corps dumpster?
[SpongeBob gets angry. He grabs at the Corps dumpster and starts raking off what appears to be my socks. I slide on the dumpster and am pulled back. Patrick gets up and starts wheeling the sock into the Corps dumpster.]
