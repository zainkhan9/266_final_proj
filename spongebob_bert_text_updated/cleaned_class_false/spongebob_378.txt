[The episode begins with Gary being born.]
Genevieve: Congratulations.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? How's my favorite part? Being a mall rat?
Genevieve: Mmm-mmm. Your favorite part. Just ask Anysworth. He's the happiest snail in the ocean.
SpongeBob: Anywhere, Anywhere. Anywhere. [His snail, Robin, comes into the scene.] 
Robin: Meow.
SpongeBob: Anywhere, Anyplace, Anytime. Anywhere. Anyplace.
Robin: [Sees a snail's shell] Meow.
SpongeBob: Anywhere, anywhere. Anywhere. Anyplace.
Robin: [Sees a snail's shell] Meow.
[SpongeBob opens his case and shows a wooden giant with a stake in his head ripping off his clothing. Robin takes his tray and prepares to eat his food. However, SpongeBob turns on the light and reveals his true nature to Robin.]
Robin: Meow.
SpongeBob: [Takes his food bowl and saw the food in his mouth from inside it. Robin begins to eat the food and SpongeBob eats some more.] 
Robin's snout snapped, so I have no clothes on. [Takes his food bowl and sees the food Robin's snout has just eaten.] 
SpongeBob: That wasn't so bad, I guess. Now I'm hungry. Anytime you need something to eat, that's all that is food. 
[SpongeBob quickly grabs some food and chuckles. Then he grabs a bar of soap, eats it, lathers it up and rubs it in some of the food's food tubes, hoping to make it palatable to Robin.]
Robin: [Gasp] Pow!
[Robin's snout bar opens and a large green substance comes out of his skin.] 
Robin's snout bar: Oh, hello! [A large green substance reaches your hand] Mine? [Giggles] 
SpongeBob: Oh, hey there, Mr. Self.
Robin: [Gasps] What's this? 
SpongeBob: It's a capsule, please. It's full of... this horrible smelling food. [The two run off as Robin's snout bar lands on Robin's face. His snout bar snaps off and a green substance enters through his eye and goes into Robin's mouth. A lightbulb appears, lights up, and SpongeBob and Gary look out through SpongeBob's nose] 
Robin: Looks like it's getting time on his TV show. 
[As SpongeBob and Gary leave the house, two police officers appear out of Robin's mouth.]
Police Officer: Sir, this is a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a suspect.
SpongeBob: Sir, sir, I have just come in contact with this horrible food. 
Police Officer: Yeah, whatever you do, don't come within 15 feet of it. 
[Gary continues to walk closer to the Snail Park where they both BURRY ANGRY.]
SpongeBob: [As Gary walks past him] Good morning, Gary! 
Gary: Meow. 
SpongeBob: Meow. What in the name of Neptune is happening? 
Patrick: This is creepy as ice cream. 
SpongeBob: Patrick, is it getting early afternoon? 
Patrick: Yes. It's getting early afternoon. 
[Gary slithers off. The Snail Park is deserted, with the clatter of fight sirens. Gary moves closer to them so fast that he knocks over a tree.] 
SpongeBob: Hold on just a little longer, Patrick. 
Patrick: Hey, you guys is that you? 
SpongeBob: That's what I am, Patrick. 
Patrick: Yes, is that what you mean, Gary? 
SpongeBob: Gary? No, Patrick, I'm not... [He starts bawling harder. Cut to later where Mr. Krabs is at the treedome again, still in his underwear]
Mr. Krabs: What the barnacles is going on out there? 
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs! You don't remember? 
Mr. Krabs: [clears throat] Yes. 
SpongeBob: Yes. Yes, Mr. Krabs. 
Mr. Krabs: [confused, then angry] What the barnacles?
