[episode starts at the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [clears throat] Mr. Squidward, [sees the note] you wrote it.
Squidward: It says, "What I do?" Yes, Mr. Krabs.
[Mr. Krabs' face turns angry.]
Mr. Krabs: [angry] What did you say?
Squidward: I said you're not angry.
Mr. Krabs: [gets an idea] What [sarcastic laugh] is that?!
[Squidward pushes him away.]
SpongeBob: I think it said "You cannot anger me, I have been saying this for years."
Mr. Krabs: [becomes surprised] But that's what I said, that's what?!
[SpongeBob lifts his head to look.]
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes I said that.
[SpongeBob looks at his head. It is Mr. Krabs' head.]
Mr. Krabs: One can never have too many angry mouths.
[The scene changes to show Squidward's head. He starts to cry.]
Squidward: Oh, why did you have to say that?
Mr. Krabs: You said it!
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's head. He has a blank look and a deep voice.]
SpongeBob: I couldn't disagree with you today, Mr. Krabs. It's just that today is the day.
[Mr. Krabs' eyes go into his head. He looks at his watch.]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out again] What's the meaning of this?!
SpongeBob: I think it says, "You cannot be angry at me, Mr. Krabs. 
[Mr. Krabs starts to cry. He runs up to SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: I can't take it anymore! I've got to get this over for you!
SpongeBob: Me, too. I know I'm in a job I hate!
Mr. Krabs: Don't make me say that!
SpongeBob: Don't you know how hard it is in your old age for one to get one's identity back?
Mr. Krabs: Old people are easy to get into trouble with.
SpongeBob: Smelly! [both look at Mr. Krabs and he explodes into a giant piece of meat] Not Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Afraid to talk trash, old person. [sniffs] And don't eat ice cream for that.
SpongeBob: Old people are, like sharks, will talk trash.
Mr. Krabs: Don't you know that talk trash, old person?
SpongeBob: Sharks are talkies.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah. Ice cream is a thing.
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah. You're right. Talking trash is very nice, old man. [laughs]
Old fish: Why, old man, are you getting along with the big guy, eh? [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, you wanna go for a walk? Well, I'd better call you a gentleman.
Old fish: Why, welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
Mr. Krabs: Eh? [leans over plate and picks up SpongeBob's fork, then gasps] SpongeBob! [both look at empty plate and fork] How many large Krabby Patties does it take to make a Krabby Patty? [shuts the plate and fork off] You stink! [gags]
SpongeBob: Well, I'd like that than just about anything else. [leans over plate and fork again then nods again] Okay, now what would you like?
Mr. Krabs: [barges out Krusty Krab desk with a bunch of patties on a shelf and read them] "This pack of extra large Krabby Patties is for the customer." 
SpongeBob: [takes patties and eats them] Ta-da, that was a nice surprise.
Mr. Krabs: Good, then, you'll be devourin' all to yourself. [Mr. Krabs throws the patties and leaves]
