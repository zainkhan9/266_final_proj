[episode starts at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, sir, thanks for your hospitality. [Mr. Krabs walks up to the cashier boat] Can I get some extra Krabby Patties, sir?
Female employee: Okay. [shifts his attention to the pile of money on the table]
Mr. Krabs: I'll give you the money. [gasps, then turns around] There's 20 orders out there. [back to Mr. Krabs] How do I get these 20?
SpongeBob: I might just be able to pull a [repetitive voice] corkscrew.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidward, [normal voice] make it stop! [cuts to SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab getting ready for serving the food. Franchisions fall out, and Fred runs up to SpongeBob] Fred! Meatballs! [shows Fred with a plate of patties] On the count of thine, me bucko!
Fred: Hey, what's with all the cartoons?
SpongeBob: The count of thine, me bucko!
Mr. Krabs: Now go tell SpongeBob he's fired. He'll come back later. [walks away disappointed]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you'll get the job.
Mr. Krabs: What? No, I left the band. Where's my gig? Where's my career? Where's my passion? Where's my passion for music?
SpongeBob: [in the Krusty Krab] Finally! The Krusty Krab. [stopswatch; turns to the screen where we see a very tired SpongeBob on a hospital bed]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't do it. I got too much rigor morte under here.
SpongeBob: I know, Mr. Krabs! Lucky in here, really gets the point across.
Mr. Krabs: Lucky? That's the worst me bucko ever!
