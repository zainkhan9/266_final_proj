[The scene starts with Gary watching the news while SpongeBob is on his clarinet playing random songs while walking to school.]
Health Inspector: Kid's catching up to me now. Excelsior!
SpongeBob: [whimpers and loses his balance] G-7! Look out!
Health Inspector: G-7! Look out!
SpongeBob: [jumps and falls over] G-7! Look out!
Health Inspector: [flaps his lips and coughs] G-7! Look out!
SpongeBob: [screams] C-3's are gonna hit me! It's for me!
Health Inspector: Then you block out my music!
Both: Yay!
[SpongeBob breathes in and out of his body.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] The perfect place for my little clarinet.
Health Inspector: Oh, what do you need?
SpongeBob: I don't know. We haven't been in touch.
Health Inspector: Oh, boy, we've been to the dance. Boy, did you know it's where ninety-nine percent of your knowledge is located.
SpongeBob: I don't know, but I know...
[Gary growls at the health inspector. The scene changes to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward playing Squidward's funeral.]
Squidward: Now, I start with my life of hearsay..
Beach Onlooker: Nautical. This is the funeral home.
[All gasp.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! What is Squidward's mind?
Beach Onlooker: Well, SpongeBuck died young and their funeral was held in their memory. Squidward's remains were put on display in their cemetery. The mourners, including SpongeBob, took to the spot. [pulls a jellyfish hive out of his body] Now, Squidward will walk the earth with the peace and beauty of his memory. [SpongeBob and Patrick cling onto each other, holding jellyfish out of coffeemakers] There you are, your remains.
SpongeBob: My clothes!
Patrick: Your money!
[They shove their coffeemakers into Squidward's body.]
SpongeBob: My coffeemaker! My clarinet! [giggles]
