[SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the Krusty Krab, tired and empty]
SpongeBob: We're here!
Patrick: Yay!
SpongeBob: We're here!
Patrick: Yay!
SpongeBob: We're here!
Patrick: Yay!
[SpongeBob closes the door and Squidward comes in]
Squidward: You left the ketchup bottle and I won! [SpongeBob walks off] Congratulations! You earned a spot on the Krusty Krab. [SpongeBob walks through the halls where there is a sign that says "Krusty KK"]
Harold: How do we do?
SpongeBob: By beating the old fish!
Harold: That is!
SpongeBob: By beating the old fish!
Harold: That is!
SpongeBob: By beating the old fish!
Patrick: Hey, buddy! They're back! They're back!
SpongeBob: Wow! They're back! I can't believe it. Nothing like a sea-level ride above sea level to be having a good time. I know these fish from time to time and they're great friends making me think of them.
Patrick: [laughs] I've got the Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: And the Krabby Patties are back.
Patrick: And the world's greatest fry cook is back.
Squidward: You've got the Ketchup.
SpongeBob: And the Ketchup is back.
Squidward: Great!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both eat their K's without distorting them] Great!
SpongeBob: The Ketchup tastes better than mustard.
Squidward: No! That kind of disgusting condiment destroys me memories.
SpongeBob: So, are you going to come over and fix it?
Patrick: Probably not.
Squidward: Probably not.
SpongeBob: Anyway, what's with the band you're playing in now, huh?
[Patrick gasps]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Slimer than mustard! Eww!
Squidward: Fine, I'll settle this later. Time to order.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. [takes the Krabby Patty out of his mouth] Patrick, your is quite alright. What's with the bottle?
Patrick: Uhh, I didn't really get the formula, you know.
SpongeBob: Hey, the bottle's right here.
Patrick: Well, how do we know it's you?
SpongeBob: Well, uh, it's a secret.
Patrick: [shakes the bottle] Tell it to the window.
SpongeBob: Wait, don't close it!
[SpongeBob closes the bottle, he takes out a bottle opener and he sings out a secret formula. He puts it over SpongeBob's words and writes in the formula on the bottle.]
SpongeBob: 1,322...
Patrick: 1...
SpongeBob: 1...
[Patrick puts the formula on the bottle and he and SpongeBob laugh.]
SpongeBob: Wow. That's amazing. I never knew underwater sounds really well are accompanied by noises.
SpongeBob: What's that by?
Patrick: By donkey's teeth.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I'm talking about... the Krabby Patty..
[Patrick rips the Krabby Patty apart and the formula flies back to Squidward.]
Squidward: Hello.
Mr. Krabs: Hmm?
[The outside of the Krusty Krab is now back where it was.]
Mr. Krabs: It was a humdinger of a win. [laughs]
