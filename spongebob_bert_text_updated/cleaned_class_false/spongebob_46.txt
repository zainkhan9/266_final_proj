SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! We have a visitor!
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: We have evolved into a society, Squidward. A society of law and order. Everybody knows everybody knows. One Squidward, for instance. We're no longer a criminal organization, but of course we are criminals. Now, you might say, SpongeBob, [SpongeBob is playing] 'Tis a crime not to mention the fact that you're the son of a supercriminal. But that's only the tip of the iceberg. So get to know your host better, SpongeBob. Know you he's a criminal... A criminal organization, that you're connected to a criminal class... [everyone is confused] ...which has a criminal past. Which means you might be getting a little too close. [SpongeBob is playing with Squidward's jellyfish] Come on, let' get that!
Squidward: SpongeBob,um,o, uhh, umm...
SpongeBob: I swear!
Squidward: SpongeBob, let me give you a legal advice. [SpongeBob is by Squidward's side, wearing a watch] The watch belongs to me. [walks away] I just need to look like... away! [no answer] Oh, no.
SpongeBob: Let me handle your trademark cough.
Squidward: [angrily] What do you mean?
SpongeBob: I'm trying to be helpful. [jumps on Squidward's stool] Here, let me play with your jello. [jumps on Squidward's stool again and throws soda on SpongeBob] Sorry, soda, Squiddy. [Squidward releases SpongeBob and throws a barrel into the air] Why don't you come here and have some patties?
[SpongeBob and Squidward are shown in a blue barnacle head boat. Squidward is shown in the boat with the sign saying SpongeBob and Squidward. It drops SpongeBob and Squidward down to the boat. Then it starts driving away. The boat starts flying again. The sign says "WELCOME" then it drives away. The two are shown again. Squidward is shown with an angry expression. His stool starts falling in pieces] Why do you keep walking this way? [Squidward pushes the stool out of the way] You know what I think of you, Squiddy?
Squidward: Do I? [is about to walk it, but then gets bounced in front of SpongeBob and Squidward] No, you don't!
SpongeBob: Don't talk to me again!
[Cut to the SquarePants home. SpongeBob is angry and moving in big, shiny, shiny, new home]
SpongeBob: Good thing I thought of that one, Squiddy.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, have you noticed the new shiny?
SpongeBob: Not anymore.
Patrick: What happened to the old shiny?
SpongeBob: I don't know. It looks kind of weird.
Patrick: You do?
SpongeBob: No, I mean...
Patrick: Hey, didn't you tell me you were moving to... oh. [is about to throw him]
SpongeBob: [thinking] Now, Patrick, I want you to remember that this is a very important responsibility.
Patrick: You are it?
SpongeBob: Yes.
Patrick: Thank you.
SpongeBob: [thinking] No, not now, thank you.
Patrick: [thinking] I'm gonna... I'm gonna... [SpongeBob loses his temper and he yelling at Patrick makes him jump and he does. Continues screaming. SpongeBob walks out of his house and into Gale's] yard.
SpongeBob: Hey, Gale, you want me home? [thinking] You're supposed to go get your beauty sleep now.
Gale: [male] What are you morons doing?! You're taking my job!
SpongeBob: I've taught public speaking for 20 years now.
Gale: So, are you gonna get some beauty sleep?
SpongeBob: Well, aren't you, little fella?
Gale: I can't make any beauty sleep, no matter how much I shan't let you.
SpongeBob: I know what you're up to, Gale. Take a look around, and see if you anything like the norm.
Gale: Well, that's not what I...
SpongeBob: [in thought bubble, he says something to Gale] ...me... idea is working.
Gale: Well, what is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Well, whatever you do, don't...
