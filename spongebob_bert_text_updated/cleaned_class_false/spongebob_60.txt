[Episode starts when SpongeBob and Patrick sneak into Squidward's house and do some housework. Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob and Patrick show up]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward! We did it! You and I will stay open for a while, just as long as house rules!
Patrick: [gasps] House rules, eh? Well, that's a thing a while ago.
SpongeBob: Yep! We're pretty open about our desire, even if that's saying open our... [Squidward closes the door] windows!
Patrick: Don't cry, Squidward. We've only got ourselves open.
SpongeBob: Oh, what am I so scared about? I can do anything I want! [SpongeBob shows Squidward the fire hydrant] Talk to him. Tell him where to find me. [SpongeBob tells him where Squidward is] He'll understand. [SpongeBob and Patrick start talking to him] Uh, how are you doing?
Patrick: Pretty good, SpongeBob. Really is good.
SpongeBob: Uh, where are you going?
Patrick: Where are you going?
SpongeBob: Going to get ready for work. That's it. [SpongeBob and Patrick walk off] Out of the way, buddy. [SpongeBob knocks on Squidward's door and the next morning] I'm ready for work.
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob:  [knocks on door] Oh, Squidward! My tartar sauce! I need a favor from the boss!
Squidward: [yells] No, it's okay, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You really need to see me... [takes off his pants and jumps in front of Patrick's door]
Patrick: You can come out now!
SpongeBob: You know, we're not supposed to look at each other. Look what I got there last night, buddy!
Patrick: Oh. Story time! [hops on his bike and laughs]
SpongeBob: And this is the best part yet! Isn't it, Patrick?
Patrick: I thought it was, huh? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Uhh, I just waiting for that car with the sign. [trips and falls over, yawns]
Patrick: Waiting for that... what the...? What the...??
SpongeBob: Oh, that's it! I've got the sign, Patrick!
Patrick: What's that?
SpongeBob: It's the opposite. I got the opposite sign. It's so bright it can be dangerous. [takes out his breath and breathes in and out] I've got the opposite sign, Patrick! [presses his face on the sign] I've got the opposite sign, Patrick! I've got the opposite sign, I've got the opposite sign, there's no one inside!
Patrick: What's wrong, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I've got all the signs!
Patrick: All the signs?
SpongeBob: Yes, all the signs. I've got the opposite sign, pinky, there's no one inside this door.
Patrick: Pinky?!
SpongeBob: Pinky?! [throws the sign in the air and begins to blow, both start to sound their whistles]
Patrick: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [continues blowing and the scene breaks outside. SpongeBob's lip starts to move as he notices his pineapple flooring it.] Okay, everybody, can we get the curtains drawn?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I guess this is a good thing we're all stuck in this dark basement forever inside that box. [faints]
SpongeBob: Darn, Mr. Krabs! You're alright!
Patrick: [fakes drowning] I overdid the rug bitches again! I think Plankton found it.
Plankton: [jumps off the table] Huh? Hahahahahahaha!
Mr. Krabs: So you two had to hide in that box, in that room, in that no one here has any idea what pineapple is, and what raspberry is, and what is better than pineapple?
[Plankton is shown jumping up and down on the floor while he is being jumped, he makes a square in the air and laughs.]
Plankton: [screams] Ow! Ow! Ow! [throws the box on the ground, Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob run out]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'll give them a chance to explain...
SpongeBob: [as Mr. Krabs runs off] Hey, shrimp cocktail!
