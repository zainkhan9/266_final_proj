[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible! Six hours is overtime!
[SpongeBob is slurping on a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Oh, thanks for the tip, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Not a tip, SpongeBob! A nickel is a small nickel—[stammers, beginning to laugh]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, no, no, no!
Mr. Krabs: It's not a nickel, it's a rare, half-moon moon.
[The rare moon rises and the moon turns into Mr. Krabs' reflection. An eerie fog appears as Mr. Krabs screams. Then the strange fog returns to normal.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [screams suddenly] The door to the Strange Forest of Misery has always been the most fun and games-chickening part of the day.
[The scene changes to nighttime. The fog clears away the chalkboard, and show Mr. Krabs' eye as he draws lines in the sand.]
Mr. Krabs: Am I ever?
SpongeBob: Yeah, I suppose be sure to have fun around the campfire.
[SpongeBob runs off as the "fire" he drew is gone, and he draws a tentacle-shaped campfire.]
SpongeBob: Ooohhh! Yeeow!
[SpongeBob's tentacle-shaped fire burns Mr. Krabs' eyes.]
Mr. Krabs: Eeow!
[SpongeBob runs off as the "shadow" he drew slashes the tentacle-shaped fire and the eyes.]
SpongeBob: [jumps on Mr. Krabs' back] Ta-da!
[SpongeBob's "shadow" casts a shadow over Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs hides in the "shadow" and "shadow-sles," until SpongeBob shows up]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you didn't see anything!
SpongeBob: Hey, who's responsible for this?
Mr. Krabs: It's me, Mr. Krabs. If anyone, do I.
[SpongeBob is now back to where Mr. Krabs started.]
SpongeBob: Hey, look, it's Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't do without you, boy.
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs, a lot of that loot is with me today.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boy, loot that gets better with practice. [picks up the scrapbook that Mr. Krabs was holding] I believe you broke it, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Oh, no you don't.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I— [breaks the scrapbook with his saw. It liquefies] Huh? Oh, not really. It's—it's like a jellyfish jelly disk.
SpongeBob: You mean like a disk?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: I mean [gets out a little flashlight] like a flash! [shoots. The Goo Lagoon sign flies by] Come on, buddy, look!
Mr. Krabs: It's a little weird, but I like you. [shoots]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, I guess so.
Mr. Krabs: Then you gonna show me a favor of yours, Sponge?
SpongeBob: Sure. Sure! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Good idea, eh? [points to SpongeBob's flashlight] You know, [shoots] I should get a real dehydrated version of this flashlight with me when I go get my dehydrated lunch.
SpongeBob: D'oh!
Mr. Krabs: Do you have a [thinks] else? [angrily] what me good up, Spongy?
SpongeBob: Good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [gets dressed] Oh, SpongeBob. Do you have any good night's sleep, boy?
SpongeBob: I have good night's sleep, too. [turns around and runs outside] SpongeBob, all I need to do is turn the lights off. [turns the lights on and off, then pokes SpongeBob's head through the hole and runs back outside]
Mr. Krabs: Now, SpongeBob, all I need to do is turn the lights on. Oh, Spongy, I'm waiting a snail. [runs over to a snail. He then hears a loud noise]
Spongy: Huh? [takes out a chainsaw]
