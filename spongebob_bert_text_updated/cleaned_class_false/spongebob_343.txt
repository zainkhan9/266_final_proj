SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. How's it going?
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you saying? I'm having so much fun?
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab Krussel Dinner is tonight!
Squidward: Well, thank you for your own[...] amusement, but you better come back tomorrow.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. [Scene switches to SpongeBob and Squidward at the counter eating.] Okay, Squidward, here's what I've got. Two Krabby Patties, please.
Squidward: [Gasp]
SpongeBob: Here's the ketchup.
Squidward: SpongeBob, what in the seven seas is going on in here?!
SpongeBob:  Making my own Krabby Patties, that's my favorite part.
Squidward: Thanks. And uh...
SpongeBob: [Notices the food] Hey, food here tastes better than food from a submarine.
Squidward: Uhh, my problem is that I have no Krusty Krab Krussel.
SpongeBob: No, it's not a food problem, Squidward. It's a skill.
Squidward: S-S-S-S-Squidward, it's my fault. I'm a cheater. You know, I may not have been a great chew, but you put in me food. And it tastes better than food from a submarine!
SpongeBob: Gibberish?
Squidward: [Succeeds again and laughs]
SpongeBob: Now you're going to give me your Krabby Patties.
Squidward: Alright, I got them. [Pushes SpongeBob out of the window] They're all yours, SpongeBob. [Goes back inside. Flicks the door shut]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. I got them both.
Squidward: Gladly. [Sees them for what they are, sighs]
SpongeBob: Well, that was pretty good.
Squidward: Gladly. [Walks out of the kitchen]
