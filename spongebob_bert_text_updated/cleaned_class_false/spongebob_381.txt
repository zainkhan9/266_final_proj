[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to work. It transitions to the Krusty Krew kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey there, granny! I must've taken your order, but it's already over. Can I sit down now? [Patrick is chewing] How dare you attack me with that nasty talk! [SpongeBob sticks his tongue in my mouth and starts chewing again] Why do you eat all this lip service? [SpongeBob continues to attack Patrick] Why do you keep doing that thing? [Patrick starts chewing and breathing heavily] Why do you eat all my things? [Patrick eats a can of beans. SpongeBob continues to eat all of his belongings while Patrick keeps chewing]
Flying Dutchman: Give me that can of beans. [Patrick eats a can of peas. SpongeBob continues to eat all of his stuff while Patrick keeps chewing]
SpongeBob: No! Now, that insulting creature is getting all out of my kitchen. [Flying Dutchman moans] I am gonna return you to your rightful place of honor. [Zoom in on Patrick angrily chewing his fingernails] But I'm gonna have to make do with the few available tools. [Takes a bunch of gum out of his pocket] There.
Patrick: Hey, look. [Opens up his mouth to show his tooth gum] It's still there.
Flying Dutchman: Emporium gum. [Holds up the gum]
Patrick: Tooth gum? Tooth gum? It just wanted some anchovies to eat that was sticking out there.
Flying Dutchman: Well, it sure is a surprise to me how often that rotten old anchovy guts gets some act right. [Gives Patrick the gum]
Patrick: Well, that's what gives it its evil smile.
Flying Dutchman: What's that horrible, ugly smelly? [Shows that it has grown a mustache on its face and is making noises]
Patrick: Well, it looks like the Dutchman is taking the dietary advice from someone who's a complete jerk.
Flying Dutchman: What kind of jerk? How do you keep your horrible stench away from me! [Zoom in on Mr. Krabs' house which has a huge wall with Mr. Krabs' picture on it. It is in the Chum Bucket he hid the picture]
Mr. Krabs: [Opens the door] Me pleasure. Uh-uh. Uh, pleasure.
SpongeBob: You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: All right, I won't do it! You're vile! Stop! You're vile!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Get down onto the floor and bend the rules. For instance, what do you say you're gonna do with my best pal Duncan?
SpongeBob: [whispering] I'm gonna turn him into a trophy, so he can be talked into doing your shopping.
Mr. Krabs: Trophy? You mean like your best pal Duncan? [takes the trophy away] Well, pal, I don't want to disappoint you. What do you have to say?
SpongeBob: Sir, I'd like to announce that I am officially your best pal Duncan Krabs! [shoves Trophy into his mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Sir, that is a beautiful day for a whale.
Narrator: One glorious week later...
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: AHHH!
[Flying Dutchman gives an evil look to Patrick which quickly turns into evil grime and then starts to hurt him. SpongeBob &amp; Patrick get scared and start screaming in pain. SpongeBob and Patrick are going to take a shower and clean the water out the fireplace. Patrick is going to take the trash, while SpongeBob and Patrick are going to take a bike and drive it to the other side of the house. SpongeBob and Patrick are going to take a dirt bike to get rid of the Dutchman's trash. But Patrick is digging through the old Krabby Patty box and SpongeBob and Patrick are closest together]
Flying Dutchman: Excuse me, Davy?
Patrick: Davy, the dump. [points to where he is digging]
SpongeBob: No, that's Davy Jones dirty digger. He's been doing it trick or bust, I heart him.
Patrick: I know, Davy! [shoots fire out at the box and scoops up the box with his hammder] Ho, ho!
Flying Dutchman: [finishing eenie-meenie-minie-mo] That's the man from the dump. Well, we better get out of here.
