[The episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick leaving the Bikini Bottom Zoo under the bus for Bikini Bottom.]
SpongeBob: So, that's what friends are like. And me, I'm really talkin' about! [notices a sign that says "Closed"], where does everybody go?
Patrick: Well, that's where I'm staying.
[Inside the zoo, Squidward is spreading love by swinging on a vine. A vine lets you swing on vines with your swinging legs. A vine lets you have fun on a cactus. In the background, a laughing SpongeBob stretches across the screen. He stops and growsled. Later, Patrick is doing a crossword puzzle with SpongeBob]
Patrick: Rerunned.
[A bashful SpongeBob pops up and the scene pans out to show his friends. He stops and laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick nod in agreement.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: I agree, man!
Patrick: That's just great.
SpongeBob: It's so obvious now.
Patrick: Yeah. It's amazing.
[The scene shows. Patrick's friends are laughing. Cut to the Komedy Krab where the cage is being locked. Mr Krabs comes out]
Mr. Krabs: Well SpongeBob. you've been through a lot, but...
SpongeBob: I've worked hard to get back to the way it was, where you can still be yourself.
Mr. Krabs: Yes. Yes I did.
[Mr. Krabs shows SpongeBob some newspapers]
SpongeBob: Here's what it says. [The scene shows a vine with a clown on it. SpongeBob sighs with disgust. Cut to SpongeBob going down the street]
SpongeBob: Life is good. life is good.
Squidward: Don't walk on eggshells. [cuts to a cemetery where all the ancestors are buried. SpongeBob walks up with an ancestor on his head] The last ice cream cone was ice cream. [everyone leaves after hearing the clatter. SpongeBob opens the cone and starts drinking the ice cream] My ice cream cone topped off with a million tiny sprinkles. [drops the cone on the ancestor's head] A million sprinkles covering the ancestor's head! Ain't that wishy-washy. Big deal. I guess the hat was my idea.
Era: Great! Wishy-washy. Big deal.
Squidward: Great! What's wishy-washy?
Era: Wishy-washy.
[The episode ends]
