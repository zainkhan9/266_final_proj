[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Patrick are hitting a plastic cup with a stick, feeling bored.]
SpongeBob: [muffled] AHHHHHHHHHH!!!! [pauses] Ahhgh! Boing! [goes to pieces] Boing! [pauses] Ahhh!
Patrick: [chuckles] Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'm a little busy right now so I don't have time for these impromptu cup soak. [takes a sample of his noodle and puts it in the cup]
SpongeBob: [at Patrick's rock] Would you mind hammering me? I'll make it so this nothing gets over in Bikini Bottom end of an awesome day! [his pinky blinks for a few seconds, then turns to Patrick] Patrick, you're not being a very good host! [Patrick is still screaming, SpongeBob hits his head and then taps Gary's shell and seeing it empty] Patrick, you have been over your normal daily routine. [Patrick's rock opens to reveal a large tank with an air duct on it.]
Patrick: Thanks SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [knocks on the air duct] Oh, that's no way to treat a guest of ordinary decency. [Patrick's shell opens up] Huh?
[SpongeBob opens the tank with Gary's tank and finds that the air ducts have gone. He tries opening the tank but goes up to the ceiling, but falls downward. He gets up and tries to reach for the tank, but his hand cramps up after he falls. The scene changes to SpongeBob trying to reach for the tank, but his hand accidentally hits the controller. SpongeBob pushes the controller away and into the air duct. Patrick's rock opens up. SpongeBob attempts to reach for the tank, but gets himself tangled up to the duct. SpongeBob climbs out of the tank, but gets himself tangled up to the duct. Meanwhile, Squidward is struggling to reach the tank, and is getting very angry.]
Squidward: I have to go to my post-college best friend's boating school! [notices SpongeBob and screams] Hey, buddy! What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Oh, this is the Boating School. Just you and me, by the name of SpongeBob and Pat.
[Squidward is about to cry when a passing train comes by and takes the tank.]
Squidward: What is that?
SpongeBob: That's the tank taken by the S.W.A.T.E. [Specializing in Towing An RV]?! They're secretly Bikini Bottom's latest boating school!
[A.M.I.G.A.S.] is organizing the boating school. She's supposedly holding a class for Boating School Geeks.
[SpongeBob and Patrick faint. The scene changes to show the exterior of Squidward's house. SpongeBob is laying on the couch, while Patrick is playing with the toy boat.]
SpongeBob: Did you hear what? Gee, I'm kind of hungry.
Patrick: Yeah. A lot of hungry.
[Gees, the three are wearing coats with "G" on them, because they think it might be a bug.]
SpongeBob: What's a bug?
Patrick: It's a very common bug in the Bikini Bottom area. It affects a huge percentage of people. It was once used as a magic stick until it was outlawed.
Gees, I'd like to introduce you to one of Squidward's favorite things, a cursed cursed cursed cursed cursed! Well, it doesn't have to be that way, SpongeBob, it can just be that way! So, go out of your way to do something nice for me. Patrick, do something nice.
Patrick: I will! He'll think of something to do it nice!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Patrick.
[The three go out into the street and they'll have to walk along the cursed path. Udon comes out with his secret formula and Patrick smells it. The police come up with a different reason why they think you're a bug and they arrest Squidward and his friends.]
Squidward: I can't get away now. I'm not gonna hide forever. I better make my escape!
[SpongeBob points the cursed path and makes it appear that way. He hallucinates when he's thinking this part.]
Squidward: [seeing the path and the hallucinations] ...Pretend I'm here!
