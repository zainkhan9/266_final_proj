[The episode begins with Gary watching a cartoon of himself jumping on a basketball. He slips on the basketball and jumps up to the top of the basketball. He slips off it and lands in a dumpster. He gets to the bottom of the dumpster where two large bottles of paint are sitting. He jumps up on the paint barrel and grabs the paint. He goes over the paint barrel and paint splatters all over the place. Robin Williams exits the dumpster, wearing black clothes and a megaphone]
Robin Williams: Over the paint! [A van is driving down the block with paint coming out of their windows]
Two girls walk into the Krusty Krab. They hit the paint cans and then leap out. The customers come out and laugh]
Nat: [While ordering a Krabby Patty] Good, world, for this paint-covered day!
Pilar: So what are you waiting for, grill mister?
Nat: I'm waiting for this truck that has just come in.
SpongeBob: Two Krabby Patties coming in just like what ol' town was yesterday. [Turns around and shows the customers the paint coming from the Krusty Krab. Some start to laugh]
Harold: It's paint time.
Nazz: That's paint time!
Nat: We need to get this paint cleaned and painted.
Fred: We're not like the Krusty Krab.
Nazz: We're not paint-free.
Fred: We're not covered in paint.
Nat: We're covered in paint-- [Plankton drips on Nat and rubs off the paint with his teeth]
Plankton: [relieved to see the customers] Oh, I'm so glad that's over.
Harold: It's paint time now.
Nat: Hey, did they all get paintkins?
Harold: Well, they did. [Squidward is about to eat a patty]
Squidward: Oh, no, you don't. [takes patty and holds it in front of Harold] You're not gonna eat that one. It's okay, it'll cover it.
Hans: Hey, I was gonna get a megaphone.
Plankton: Hey, you ain't allowed in my restaurant. [Hands Harold a megaphone. Scene cuts to Plankton taking a picture]
Plankton: That won't do. I'm gonna have to make a change.
Hans: Hey, would you mind saving those pennies?
Plankton: Just a change, won't I?
Hans: Yeah, I could use some paint.
Plankton: That won't do. I'll have to make a drastic change in me own image.
Hans: You're morons!
Plankton: That's easy, take a picture.
Hans: Thanks.
[Scene cuts to Plankton sitting at a desk reading a coffee mug. He turns to Hans. He is cleaning the windows outside]
Plankton: You know, Hans, sometimes, I wonder how we've gotten into this mess.
Hans: Hans, I'm a card-carrying idiot.
Plankton: You were suppose to guard the restaurant against this day ever coming to an end. [Gets stepped on by Hans]
Hans: Hey, you microscopic D.N.D. abomination!
Plankton: What? Not.Abomination!Plankton! [Mouth organ plays rock music as background music is heard. Plankton walks out with a badge, aplastics, and triumphantly walks out with a license]
Plankton: What?! Why I--[freaks out] Can I ever fill you up like this?
Hans: Yes, sir. [goes back to cleaning]
Plankton: Hans, would you please get some cleaner spirits? These two are no match for my own.
Hans: I can't match your stink, sir. I'm a dirty old ketchup pump. Drink me up!
Plankton: But what if I can't get a grip on myself, Hans? What if my molecules breaks?!
Hans: What if it's too late, Hans? My molecules are no longer sticky or pallid anymore! Now, I want you to punch me in the face!
Plankton: I can--!?! But what if it might well turn sour--
Hans: What if it turns nasty--
