[The episode starts in Pearl's room where Pearl goes to bed]
Pearl: [in bed] La da de, la da da, la da. [She yawns as the episode begins]
Squidward: [in her bed] Pearl, don't you wake her up. [notices the window] Oh, Neptune's ascension to the new heavens and the new earth. What a magnificent creature. [shudders] I have never felt anything like it. [screams] I can feel it. [screams] Whooaaa? 
Pearl: [in her bed, with SpongeBob outside outside] I can definitely feel it.
Squidward: Oh, no.
Pearl: Are you sure you're okay?
Squidward: It's nothing personal, I...just...just said...it..
Pearl: Hey, SpongeBob, you have to be more thoughtful.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, you are a marvelous father.
Squidward: And just look at your hand.
[SpongeBob rubs Pearl's head while Squidward plays clarinet]
Pearl: Thanks.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Squidward.
Squidward: Just be aware. There's always a chance you'll say that wrong.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward, I'm coming to save you.
Squidward: [slams into her bed, oblivious]
SpongeBob: Hooray. [wakes up] Ah, the fear of the unknown. I've got the answer to everything.
[Squidward imagines himself in a Captain-Pirate costume trying to solve a puzzle]
Captain: How do you solve this?
Squidward: How do I know it's you?
Pirate: I'm looking for Sandy's treedome.
Pearl: Great, now you're gonna have to ask her to open it.
Squidward: Who, me?
Pearl: The man who fixed the infestation.
Pirate: I have the answer to all your problems.
Pearl: I cure yours.
Captain: Careful.
Pearl: Can you say what number of times you need to ask her?
Pirate: I need answer here.
Squidward: [he gets angry] Science!
Pirate: You're so gullible.
Pearl: I'm sorry, sir.
Pirate: You Saints!
Squidward: Let me ask you this thing.
[SpongeBob and Squidward inch their way into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: How long have you been asking for my starfish hats?
Squidward: I've been asking for 'em.
Pearl: Why, sir?
Pirate: They're a symbol of the Royal Swedish Monarchy. [points to Squidward's head with a skull and crossbones]
Lady officer: [opens the back of the hat and shows a skull and crossbones on the head] Those were the original designs.
Pirate: Oh, they were so popular.
Squidward: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, ow, ow. Ooh, I just got here.
