[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is singing to a small group of customers in a barbeque. He bows to them, then puts his tie on to his face.]
Mr. Krabs: Ta-da! [kisses a tie] I'm so happy for you! And for the customers, too! Ta-da! [kisses more tie-els] Huh? Ta-da!
Customers: Huh? [looks at Mr. Krabs' tie and sees a doorman on a conveyor belt]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [giggles and takes off tie]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, did you know that you get to watch all this on your own television screen tonight?
Mr. Krabs: I never thought I'd say this, but today I'm gonna be watching you.
SpongeBob: [turns T.V. on TV] My screensaver needs you. [enters the kitchen of the Krusty Krab. A bell rings] Leave me be!
[SpongeBob take off his TV and runs with it]
SpongeBob: Aw, not that screen, Mr. Krabs. [enters kitchen. Notice the different screensaver screenplays. He walks over to the table with the spatula] Here's what I'd normally do... [SpongeBob grabs it] ...before I start working on my patty. [SpongeBob holds it in front of you] Before I start work on my patty. [SpongeBob moves the spatula closer to you and you block the screen] Before I start work on my patty. [SpongeBob moves your head closer to the plate] Before I start work on my patty. [SpongeBob moves his head closer to the plate] Before I start work on my patty. [SpongeBob moves his head closer to the plate] Before I start work on my patty. [SpongeBob moves his head closer to the plate] And then after the first two... [Plankton moves between them. He is holding up two burnt patties] And after the first two... [Plankton starts to cry and is rubbing his hands together. He gives up. He hits the table and runs away. He opens the door. Notice the plate in the freezer. Plankton is screaming. Cut to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey Squidwart!
Squidward: You're not gonna eat my Krabby Patties? [Mr. Krabs points to the freezer again. He sees the burnt patty] Uh, uh, uh...
Mr. Krabs: You can't replace it!
Squidward: We've got a grill, we know how, a good grill is... [Mr. Krabs starts to cry] My.
Mr. Krabs: ...a good grill... [Cut to a Krusty Krab with burnt patties on the grill]
SpongeBob: How are we going to do that?
Mr. Krabs: [opens kitchen door] Ah.
SpongeBob: How are we gonna do that? That's what I'm wondering.
Mr. Krabs: That's what you're asking, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: That's what?!
Mr. Krabs: I don't... [walks right and starts to dig] That's not good.
SpongeBob: Well, we could do that.
Mr. Krabs: You think you could fool me with a stupid lid?
SpongeBob: Oh, I've got the brain, Mr. Krabs. Let's try this one.
Mr. Krabs: Just one... [licks his lips]
SpongeBob: ...sell-out...
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] You're not gonna do that, are you?
SpongeBob: No. Please.
Mr. Krabs: Good idea, sell me soul.
SpongeBob: But I don't know what I'd do without you! [begins to sob]
Mr. Krabs: Come with me, boy.
SpongeBob: But what if I told you... [Mr. Krabs stops sobbing] ...I... [Mr. Krabs stops sobbing again] ...I'm... [Mr. Krabs stops sobbing] ...Krabs... [Mr. Krabs stops sobbing again] ...MrCrabâ€™ [SpongeBob stops sobbing]
Mr. Krabs: What in Neptune's name is the other one?
