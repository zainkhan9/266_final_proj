[Episode starts with Squidward standing in the middle of the street and looking down at his reflection.]
Squidward: My shame! My shame! [He walks into a brick wall and bumps into his reflection's face] Ow.
[The brick wall goes away. The scene fades back to Mr. Krabs looking through the hole in the wall with SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, we gotta get out of here! [SpongeBob pulls himself out of the hole] I can't go out in the street light. [He cries and Squidward runs back into the Krusty Krab] Ah. [He screams again and Squidward touches him, causing him to get bashed in the face and he falls down the stairs. He gets up and screams again. He gets up and his scream turns into a scream and he gets smashed into a brick wall and his reflection goes away. He screams and his reflection gets splashed all over the Krusty Krab. He screams again and Squidward hands him a bag of money. Squidward hands SpongeBob and drinks the soup he just gave to give out the Krusty Krab but SpongeBob is going to eat him and he has aomachi] I can't take it! [He gets splashed all over the Krusty Krab. He is sitting in a puddle on the floor. His stool gets filled up with water and he is barefoot. His head gets filled up with water as he talks and he is squished all over the Krusty Krab as everyone walks around him distorted. He is also all bandaged up] My bandages! [He is bandaged up more since he got splashed all over the Krusty Krab. He is bandaged up even more since he got bashed in the face, he is bandaged up even more since he got spit on his face, he is bandaged up even more since he got shucked on the grill. He is bandaged up even more since he got grilled on a spatula set. He is bandaged up even more since he got stepped on on by Davy Jones. He is bandaged up even more since he got stung by the tic-tac-toe version of him. He is bandaged up even more since he got bounding down the street to work eeny-...
SpongeBob: [Eyes blink, Mr. Krabs hears] Mr. Krabs, are you okay? [Mr. Krabs pokes his eyes out through his hat] Uhh, Squidward?
Mr. Krabs: [runs over to Squidward] You're trespassing. And I hope this doesn't happen to my job. [Gives SpongeBob another go at it] Gee, Mr. Krabs. I was just about to write a whole paper on the Krusty Krab. [blinks, frown and sucks his thumb] Uh, how'd you do that?
Squidward: [walks into his house] Boy, I knew I'd never see the day.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, back to work!
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: [laughs] You see, Squidward, all I wanted was to work at the Krusty Krab. And if working for the Krabby Patty Company was more fun, I'd go out of my way to look for work.
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: Look, Squidward, I'm doing all right. And if you need any help, just ask. [to diary] I'm tellin' ya, it's just a stupid diary, SpongeBob.
Squidward: It is, is all.
SpongeBob: But that's all I can remember.
Squidward: Forget the stupid. Let's look at the practicalities. [turns to diary] I need a jump start.
SpongeBob: How's that, Squidward?
Squidward: I need a jump start.
SpongeBob: I'm not sure.
Squidward: How's this, Squidward?
SpongeBob: Look, I just want to get back to providing for my family.
Squidward: Forget the stupid.
SpongeBob: I'm telling you something completely different. If I get back to pointing this thing, it'll be because I remembered.
Squidward: That's not what I said.
SpongeBob: Well, I don't remember.
Squidward: Oh, yeah? So, I'm going to make a jump for a while.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, no jump?
Squidward: I'm not sure.
SpongeBob: I knew it!
