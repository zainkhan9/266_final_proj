[episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to work]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. [giggles] I am so glad you got your break.
Patrick: I did, fellas. I love to bumping things up and down.
SpongeBob: Oh, this is great.
Patrick: It's like a new job. [Patrick gets himself stepped on by Sandy] My teeth are chattering.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm getting a little tired.
Patrick: Not yet. [steps on SpongeBob's foot with his thumb] There.
SpongeBob: Come on. [steps on Patrick's thumb again] There.
Patrick: Don't you get it?! You ain't a dentist.
SpongeBob: [gasps] You're not?! You don't even have a license.
Patrick: Aye, I do.
[SpongeBob walks on screen covered in plaque]

SpongeBob: You know, this isn't so bad. Everybody seems to be having a Krabby Patty. [everyone has a Krabby Patty]
Squidward: Oh, great. Double-plaque. [a magnifying glass is shown]
[a small number shown]
Patrick: Hey, everyone! Our annual Krabby Patty contest is upon us! You can be the best dentist in Bikini Bottom. [Patrick starts to blow a breath test]
SpongeBob: And you can show your all-star oral oral oral reporting your teeth like never before!
[SpongeBob walks over and gets his teeth done up]
Patrick: Now, this is a thing. [notices SpongeBob lying on a pile of papers]
SpongeBob: Now, Patrick, do you have one minute of fame or infamous toothpaste delivery? [Patrick notices the newly created vacuum]
Patrick: Both of them coming.
SpongeBob: No, yeah, both of them. [screams]
Patrick: I can't even make out what's left of the left side of my tooth. [screams]
SpongeBob: [hiding under his papers] Right, yeah, now that's what I call a new name. [they hide under the chair]
Patrick: Oh, my gosh. Toothpaste delivery! That's working!
SpongeBob: Great, Patrick. Let's go see the dentist.
[the scene cuts to the bathroom where SpongeBob pulls himself out from under his own toothpaste and onto a platter]
Patrick: Now, that's a beautiful sight.
SpongeBob: And it was not without its mistakes. As the toothpaste gradually dries off, the sponge's natural ability to hear sounds shrinks. And it becomes silent. But when you mute it, it becomes silent again. And when you throw it off, it becomes silent. So, that's what I call a true sound, a true sound at that.
Patrick: Oh, fatter than that!
SpongeBob: Oh, it's like that in the head, Patrick?
Patrick: Yes, it is.
SpongeBob: It's so out of whack with my other toothpaste that I can barely use it, throw it off, and still have it.
Patrick: Oh, no it's not!
SpongeBob: It's possible, I've been brushing my behinds.
Patrick: Yes, it is, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: And now I'm almost toothpaste free.
[when SpongeBob tries to speak, his mouth is shown as a straw]
Man: Ha, ha! Don't you want to know what I think of you, buddy?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That I do, pal!
Patrick: And you do!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Well, let's see, yes.
Patrick: And if I were you, I would want to talk to you about teeth like this! [both talk briefly about brushing their behinds, then they laugh, then SpongeBob walks out]
SpongeBob: Let's go back to the barn.
Patrick: [Spotlight on SpongeBob] Well, I won't stand for it. I'll pass the test yourself.
SpongeBob: Are you sure you want to, Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah! I mean I want it, right?
SpongeBob: Well, how do you decide if you want to talk to me or not?
Patrick: Well, I don't know.
SpongeBob: Well, then I like it how I'm talking it. [Both laugh]
Patrick: Well, well, how do you know if you want to?
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know.
Patrick: Well, that's okay. I don't know.
