[The scene fades to Bikini Bottom at night.]
Girl Fish: [gets beaten up by Gary's cactus and lies down] I never thought I'd say this, but tonight, I'll eat one cactus and wake up like a brainless baby. [screams as Gary runs up snailspin and down to all out brute force with no answer] Or this. [snaps with a sleep mask and gets shocked when SpongeBob pops out next to him licking his sleep mask with his teeth and using his tongue like a toilet] Or this. [Gary gets shocked by this and runs away and screams] Or this and this. [Gary wakes up and wakes up and screams and runs all the way back up to sleep and then this again. Gary runs off and Gary suddenly wakes up and screams. Scene cuts to SpongeBob with his eyes bandaged up]
SpongeBob: Gary, it's me. [snaps fingers] It's terrible. I can't even get down to sleep again. Or maybe it was 50/1,000 too many. Oh, I'll just take that pie-in-the-wall, boy. [laughs] We can just stick a bigger pie on top of that. I think. [laughs]
Gary: [comes out from his wound] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, I am so sorry you're little Wormy and Wormy's mom, Sherm.
Gary: My baby.
SpongeBob: Really?
Gary: Yep. [crunches up, grabs Gary, and rushes over to Sherm.] Hey, grandma.
SpongeBob: [giggles, and notices he's been covering up his tummy with his own slime] What's your problem, dear? [Gary seems to have been covering Wormy's place with his teeth]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, I can't remember a thing about this. Maybe it was the pain. Or maybe it was the pain... [whimpering] the excruciating pain. [screams] Oh, just like I didn't even exist before in the first place, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, now you're gonna show me all about my new hobby! [shows SpongeBob a door that says 'HOW TO GET OUT OF HERE'] Oh, that'sovehouse. [opens with Patrick and knocks on the door]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: I'd like to introduce you to Wormy.
SpongeBob: [gasps]?! What kind of monster?!
Patrick: I have a confession to make. This room is all yours. I didn't even know y-sawing and I can't get my hands on any more of this.
SpongeBob: Oh, so that's how you're gonna get out?
Patrick: No, no, no, no, Wormy won't let me. I've gotta go. I have to find my own pet. I better go rush out and find my pet. [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing by a Wormy taped to a table] Oh, Grandma. [pulls a string] I don't want my pet Wormy to get into too many things. I mean, not to get into too many things. I mean, not to get into too many things. I mean, Wormy loves Grandma.
Grandma: Oh, SpongeBob, I'm no longer with you! [screams and runs away] Oh, Wormy! [scene cuts to SpongeBob running away but Wormy barricades the door with bolts] Oh, Grandma? Oh, I've gotta tell you something, little fella. It really hurts.
Mrs. Puff: If I were you, I would ask every living thing in Bikini Bottom to ransom its citizens for entering into a three-way war with you.
SpongeBob: No, no, Grandma. No, no. I want you to go home and at least give me a kiss from now on.
Grandma: Oh, I think we better make do with the old Saviour Cookies.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Grandma. No, no, no. I want you to go home and at least give me a kiss from now on.
Mrs. Puff: Puff, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Oh, you know what, Mrs. Puff? I think I know the answer to that. I'm not going out on a date, Grandma. I'm not even dating. I'm dating the only girl now. No, no, no. [gets in her car and drives away]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I need all the help I can get.
