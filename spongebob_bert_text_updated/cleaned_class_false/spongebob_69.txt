[The episode begins with Gary and Patrick playing in a park]
Gary: Meow.
Patrick: Meow.
[SpongeBob and Gary are walking by]
SpongeBob: Oh, I love this game. [takes it upon his hands and gives it to Patrick] It's delightful, isn't it, Gary?
Patrick: Oh, yeah. [hands it to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Good idea, Patrick. [laughs]
[SpongeBob walks into a bush]
Patrick: Ooh, I like this better. Hey, Squidward, this might be my best game in a show of strength.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I play that a lot. [cries] I need that. [takes it off and wags his tail] Hey, Squidward, that was the worst tail wag I ever saw. You can't have it again.
Squidward: [growls in pain] No! No!
