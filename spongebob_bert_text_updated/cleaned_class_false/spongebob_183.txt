[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house where SpongeBob and Patrick get into a mini mini bath and share a bubble bath. SpongeBob is spraying fruit punch in Squidward's face.]
Patrick: [turns SpongeBob around] We're gonna have to start over!
SpongeBob: We want to go for a walk in the park, huh, buddy?
Squidward: Don't think we can do too much walking in the pores.
[SpongeBob turns Squidward around.]
SpongeBob: Okay, you can walk a little more now.
[Squidward stands motionless and SpongeBob pulls his face toward his eyes. The scene changes to show SpongeBob's face as a jump rope. Squidward screams and runs away. SpongeBob swings his arm around and inches around around the jump rope. The jump rope hits Squidward's leg and makes him stand flat on the ground.]
SpongeBob: [bumps into Patrick] Hi, Patrick. How are you feeling today?
Patrick: I'm not feeling it.
SpongeBob: I heard that! Wrong!
[SpongeBob walks a little faster than previously thought. His body bumps into Patrick's head and the two of them are startled to see each other. They laugh and leapfrog over each other in the air. They bump into each other's toes and go over into something soft. They put their hands together and begin to eat. They giggle and tip over and become stuck to the floor. They crawl to the door.]
SpongeBob: Oh, that is too cold. Too wet.
[The scene shows a dark alley. Police cars and dumpsters are moving.]
Police Officer: Is that him?
Police Officer #2: No. No. It's Squidward. He's in there. We can't tell him out here. He's in there with the cop. He'll be keeping the secret.
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, please, police officers, I need a doctor to house-sniff him.
Patrick: Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo.
[SpongeBob tips over and goes to the front door. Patrick steps on Squidward's head and spits a pearl. He opens the door and a fly is fly-fishing with Patrick inside. The scene changes to show Squidward. He opens the door.]
SpongeBob: Oh, thanks for the tip.
Squidward: No, no, no, no, thank you. [goes back inside. SpongeBob leaves]
SpongeBob: Wait! I can't go out there!
Squidward: [He falls down] Oh. [slides down the wall] I can't... [slides on the other wall and crashes down on the other wall. He gets up] What happened?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob's eyes met] eyes.
Squidward: What the? How were you two making that face?
SpongeBob: [Squidward is walking outside] Squidward, we were going to go inside. [makes faces] Heads up, guys. Look how excited they are to finally be inside your own skin!
Squidward: Look how excited they are!
SpongeBob: Yeah. Look at how excited they are!
Squidward: Look at their shiny faces!
SpongeBob: Yeah! [makes faces]
Squidward: What are you two talking about?
SpongeBob: They're going to the party!
Squidward: What are you talking about?
SpongeBob: I'm going to the party!
Squidward: You're not going to the party?
SpongeBob: No...
Squidward: No! What you are talking about is outer space!
SpongeBob: We're going to the party!
Squidward: Can I use your quarters?
SpongeBob: Our quarters are [Squidward makes weird faces] exactly what they say, exactly what they want.
Squidward: Oh, really?
SpongeBob: Well, you got a date with me today. [Squidward gets out of his vehicle]
Squidward: What are you on?
SpongeBob: We're on a date. [the only sign that says open at 46,000 feet] Bald eagle, Bald eelder, Bald eagle, Bald eagle, Bald eelder.
Squidward: We'll open up. [shuts the door, walks to the picnic table, and puts his shell on] There we go.
[The scene changes to the kelp forest west on the ridge. SpongeBob and Squidward are still talking at a high voice]
Squidward: Today's my date.
