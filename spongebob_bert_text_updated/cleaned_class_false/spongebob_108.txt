[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick skipping down the hall.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Patrick stops after them]
Patrick: SpongeBob! [points and picks his teeth again] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [Falling] What? Sorry! [Throws the last piece of gum on the ground]
Patrick: SpongeBob! [Throws up a new one] Hello, SpongeBob-Bubblefish.
SpongeBob: Hey! [gives a thumbs-up] So did I.
Patrick: Yeah! Haha.
SpongeBob: [thumbs-up] My Mom's recipe! Yummy! Hahahaha!
Patrick: Yummy! Hahaha! [Both laugh. Scene cuts to them walking through the kelp forest]
SpongeBob: Look at all this cool stuff! [points to a large aquarium full of fish food] Hey, Patrick! [points to a random plate of spaghetti]
Patrick: SpongeBob! [gives a thumbs-up] Here you go. [throws the spaghetti at a fish's machine]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, that's more like it. I remember when the real Iron Bun was a while ago and I wanted that one back.
Patrick: Yeah. [takes out a Krabby Patty] Why won't anyone order the real Iron Bun back?
SpongeBob: It's a dream come true! [takes out a double bite of the patty] Oh, it's all my dreams! I love my work, I'll never forget you. [gets a dirty room and clean, old room] I've got a hot date with my friends, I go out all night knitting stuffs, I think of new stuffs often, and uh... I play my clarinet. [gets a woodwind in the living room and blows himself out] All my friends have gone away, and I can feel my arteries clogging up with hate. So, I get what I deserve, and I get to make it, too. [puts a wooden board on the counter] Yeah, this one's made out of tin cans, but I'll get those and the box springs will come out later.
Squidward: SpongeBob, if you had to pick one thing, it's going to be this. [takes the board out of the box and holds up a pair of boxing gloves] Well, actually, I got you that. [laughs] You know, you're a little shorthanded, [takes the boxing glove] but I a) got you, b) gave you the other one, and c) today I am FINLAND'S #1 FIGHTING FIGHTING FIGHTING SINGER! Greetings, fellow fighters, it is I myself The International Fighting Fighting Star!
Patrick: That's me?
SpongeBob: You're a great, papy?
Patrick: Yes! [laughs, runs over, drops the box spring, and breaks his arm] And a proud star! [SpongeBob runs off to the entranceway] Take your crown back, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick! [screams]
Patrick: You are not welcome, either! [SpongeBob breaks through the left wall of the Krusty Krab, kicks the door open, and groans] Victory is mine! [SpongeBob kicks the door open, smashing his arm]
SpongeBob: [opens window] Hey, Patrick. Won't you find me forever?
Patrick: Huh? Well, you can live with that. [throws a brick, which hits SpongeBob's arm]
SpongeBob: [opens window] I don't get it, Patrick.
[cuts to the Boxing Committee]
Patrick: [looking at his arm] Hmmm. [bangs his hand on SpongeBob's hand] Next up was Boxing Committee member from Texas, [shows his hand] Patrick from the fact that we're not supposed to look at your face.
Patrick: What's next?
SpongeBob: [looks at his face] Looking... [faces Patrick, who groans] At face. [laughs]
[cuts to outside]
SpongeBob: [humming] Patrick, you look better.
Patrick: But I'm not supposed to look at you like that. [humming]
SpongeBob: But I just wanted to say that, [humming] he died funny.
Patrick: Funny? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. [Patrick laughs]
SpongeBob: [Patrick hums] Patrick, please don't be funny.
Patrick: I'm sorry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [humming again] So, what is it?
