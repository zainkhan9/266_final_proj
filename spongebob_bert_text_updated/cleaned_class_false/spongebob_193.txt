[scene transitions to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is ordering the items]
Mr. Krabs: Double the Krabby Patty! [screaming]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, tell them about the Patty you just sauntered over.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, oh, I can't do that. I've got a dangerous obsession with getting the Krabby Patty stuck in me restaurant, and I don't want it to get stuck in me customers.
Squidward: You're making me customers?
Mr. Krabs: That's not what this is, and I won't get it!
[everyone runs in]
Mr. Krabs: Eat my, and your restaurant's not just fine anymore. Eh? Eh? [shudders then turns off the light and looks at his watch]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, what have I been doing all day?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, nothing, it's just sitting on your head! [laughs and rises his television. Shows a map with his money] We've got pretty good news, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs. We've got a surprise for you. This is not going to be easy.
Mr. Krabs: It's, it's, it's, it's, it's not, it's just fine?
SpongeBob: It's fine, Mr. Krabs. It's just that this is not the way you want it.
Mr. Krabs: Go ahead. Fine. My word, you're going to have to ask nicely.
SpongeBob: Uh, could we get the [kilo] kilo?
Mr. Krabs: Well, how about if he's, uh, you know, he's... he's... he's not here.
SpongeBob: He's not in here?
Mr. Krabs: No, he's... [gets bounced in his chair] He's just here to say he's sorry we sold the Krusty Krab, and we'll get to show him the Krusty Krab without him.
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Mr. Krabs. It was a deal we made, we'd made over a million years, we'd made into a million and a half song. [Mr. Krabs sings again]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what are we gonna do with you, boy?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, you told me all was right.
Mr. Krabs: That's what it says, boy.
SpongeBob: What say we stop?
Mr. Krabs: You bet we've got. [SpongeBob gets off his chair] Lean in, SpongeBob. [gives cup] Pizza, please. [leaves]
SpongeBob: I'm not falling for it.
Mr. Krabs: I know, I know. Sheesh. I'm a boy, I'm a girl. What's so great about it, anyway? I'm finally leaving you alone.
SpongeBob: Oh, great. I'll find something to do which is both more lovely and less depressing.
Mr Krabs: That's what?
[cuts to later on]
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward, I just wanted to say all's forgiven. I'm leaving you alone.
Squidward: Yeah, I can't stay out too much. I feel like a virus for a sense of humour.
[cuts to Patrick's house]
Patrick: [knock on door] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [nose sticks out in nail chaining] Patrick, my back is infected! He's going to get a tick!
Patrick: Hooray!
Squidward: He is?
SpongeBob: [bowling] You don't need a tick to get a tick. A tick can't kill. The tickles are coming from your tummy.
Patrick: tummy?
SpongeBob: tummy!
Patrick: [stomach growls] Where's my vet?
SpongeBob: sir, my vet.
Patrick: [walks] Oh, boy, Mr. Krabs is here. Howdy, sir. Can we talk horse country?
SpongeBob: [sticks out tongue] Sure. Lets start with a ride in a barrel.
Patrick: It's a barrel?
SpongeBob: [slurps] Oh, yeah. I'll start with a smoothie.
[cuts to "A Very Happy SpongeBob Lonely on a Train"]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You can't take that train!
