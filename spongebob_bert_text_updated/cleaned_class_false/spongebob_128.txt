[The episode starts when SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off. Then it goes up and plays music. Then Mr. Krabs comes out of his house]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidward. Guess I didn't hear ya. A little music should help.
Squidward: [sighs] Guess it.
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, Squiddus. But I can't keep my eyes off you. You're dying.
Squidward: [sighs]
Mr. Krabs: Guess I can keep mine naked. [laughs. Squidward is grossed out and lying on the ground]
Squidward: So, how's my "victory gussetouch" look?
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward. At least his "good cop no longer chasing us" look worked.
Squidward: Oh, I've never been chased by cops so often. Sounds like a great idea, Squidward. [suddenly, his pants rip rip]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward!
Squidward: Oh, do I think of you every day?
SpongeBob: Why, of course! See you tomorrow, Squidward. [cut to SpongeBob and Squidward, who are now dressed as policemen]
Squidward: How embarrassing?
Mr. Krabs: So what do you think?
Squidward: [gets in Mr. Krabs mouth and starts to mumble] Mhhfthew, I guess I'll confess to a crime one day, and get sent straight to the penitentiary, and your very own chin. [winks at Squidward]
SpongeBob: Mhh, mhh, chin!
[Cut to the Chum Bucket, with lots of balloons. Squidward is carrying his pet chum, Calypso. We see a bit SpongeBob outside holding the bottle]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward. I think your stink got to stop. I today am you. [shows the bottle] Let me try him for a shake. [we see SpongeBob trying to get some chum. He spits it out and it sticks to his head. SpongeBob smiles and blows some chum in a bottle. He spits it out again and it sticks to his face. SpongeBob walks outside and we see that all the police station is behind him]
Warden: Hey SpongeBob, I want you to think for a second about what I said. Did I say choke you down? Or did I say to choke you down? [we see that the bottle has poison ivy underneath] Let me make this pretty. [we see that the bottle has water below it] So what do you think?
SpongeBob: I actually think I've got choke acid on my nose.
Warden: [shows the bottle] Here uh- [SpongeBob stands ready to throw the bottle and it hits him in the face]
SpongeBob: [cackling] Don't worry, Warden, I'm here to serve my warning. I've got choke acid on my nose. [crawls to the edge of the bottle] Don't worry, Warden, I'm not leaving here 'til I tell you to. [we see that the bottle has water below it] No! Water!
Warden: Hold on a second, [Warden shows a large metal detector in the middle of the room] we haven't served that poisonous chum yet. [he quickly recites a "Catch-20! Know Your Peace" command. SpongeBob is shocked, he then begins to relax]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, I'm so glad that's over. [cut to SpongeBob running back to the cell]
Warden: Hold it right there. I know you're in there, buddy. It's a memory.
SpongeBob: [getting ready to throw the bottle] Oh, yeah. [he misses the vine by a few steps]
Warden: Now what? Oh, I forgot. [SpongeBob tries to remember] Oh, I forgot. [SpongeBob tries to remember] I can't remember. [SpongeBob tries to remember] I can't remember.
SpongeBob: Okay. [he's a few feet from the vine]
Warden: Now what? Oh, I'm square. [SpongeBob stands still] How's this for a cliffhanger?
SpongeBob: I don't know. [he tries to remember. Walks over the edge] How's it going?
