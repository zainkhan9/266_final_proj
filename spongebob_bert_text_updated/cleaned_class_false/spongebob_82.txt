[Episode begins at the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money, I've got as many orders as you boys... [clears throat] Excuse me.
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, I'm done.
Mr. Krabs: That's what I am supposed to do.
Squidward: But I thought you gave your friend ketchup.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] What? What did I do?
[Mr. Krabs goes to Squidward, but his hand spins around and he follows.]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Squidward ordered this meal and I want it now.
Squidward: [gets in the kitchen and starts sweating] Did you check the patty?
Mr. Krabs: [gets really angry] I did not! It's a mess! Now why you bring me help?
Squidward: [shuts door] For what?
[Mr. Krabs starts sweating up the idea of getting hit by a car pump, so Squidward pushes him to the window.]
SpongeBob: Time for a refill.
Squidward: [screams and slams the cash register up with his eyes]
Mr. Krabs: [shuts him inside of the kitchen] There he goes, buddy.
[SpongeBob slides out of Mr. Krabs' body.]
SpongeBob: Here's your order, sir.
[Mr. Krabs takes out his order book and reads it.]
Squidward: No!
[Mr. Krabs pushes Squidward to the window and Squidward gets squished. Sculptures on Squidward's body pile up on him.]
SpongeBob: It's the most I can sculpt was I there. Oh, Squidward, the day is [his jaw drops] coming.
[Squidward sucks on his jaw and looks up at the sky. When he sees SpongeBob working, he froze up. He accidentally pulls the sheet off and it forms into a shape of a bunny and he laughs.]
Squidward: [holds up his hand] Oh, you could make one. Bunny and bunny, bunny and bunny, bunny and bunny, bunny and bunny, bunny and bunny, bunny and bunny.
[Squidward takes out a mini snowclone robot.]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Maybe you can take my bunny reins.
[SpongeBob hums in excitement. He grabs Squidward's legs and carries them over to the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
[SpongeBob peaks Squidward's head through the snowclone's holes and pulls out his snow brother.]
Squidward: [babbles and looks through the snowclone's eyes] My universe is exactly the same as your being, my friend. [shudders] Why, thank you, Neptune.
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Are you sure you're the right size, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Just zero.
Mr. Krabs: Make aasty.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob begin to make a huge pile of snow. They start to dig in huge amounts of snow, but they end up getting stuck because of the snow.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, it's not fair.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
[SpongeBob lifts his head up and Squidward gets smaller by the pile of snow. But he gets bigger by the fire and grows so big that he breaks off.]
Squidward: [looks at his left hand] Whoo-ha.
[Squidward's right hand stops below him and grows so big that it breaks off.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidward, it's not just an order!
[Mr. Krabs gives the customers soup and ice. Squidward feeds his two feeding chewed-up hands.]
Fred: Feed me soup!
Nat: My feeding chewed-up hand. This ice block is too thick.
Squidward: Nyah, nyah,ah,nah,nah,nah.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, make a snow clone of yourself.
Squidward: Okay. [sees SpongeBob's face and starts copying him] SpongeBob, do you have any good snow clones around?
SpongeBob: I have a snow clone of myself now.
Squidward: [thinking to himself] I made myself a clone.
SpongeBob: Now you're saying I have no good snow clones around?
