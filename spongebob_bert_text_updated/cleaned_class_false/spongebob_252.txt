SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: All right, I'll bite. SpongeBob, everything's all right. Why, you were saying that Squidward was lying?
SpongeBob: [Squidward's eye twitches. He takes a look at Squidward's fake smile.] That's enough. I'm ready, Squidward.
Squidward: All right, answer the door. [door opens] Little do we know, Squidward, that this delicious family meal we're eating today is the work of someone who is neither a... [makes eye turn with his fork. It hits his head] Eatery! [screams. He slides off the door and gets up in a doctor blue robe]
Doctor Blue: Doctor, what happened?
Doctor: Your scream is coming from the brig.
SpongeBob: [Doctor looks through the window with Squidward on it] I don't understand.
Doctor: Who?
SpongeBob: [Doctor makes a weird look] I think that she's dead, Doctor.
Doctor: That's what you think?
SpongeBob: No, that's what I think.
Doctor: Who?
SpongeBob: [Doctor makes a face again] I don't know, doctor.
Doctor: Who?
SpongeBob: [Doctor makes a face again] I think that he's been experimenting on our lives.
Doctor: Doctor.
SpongeBob: [Pointing to Squidward] What do you think?
Squidward: I think I'm gonna get injected with a nasty secret dose of that nasty secret.
Doctor: Is that what you think?
Squidward: What's this?
Doctor: This thing.
[The doctors figure out that Squidward is really just a zombie who wants to experiment on the little guy.]
One doctor: Well, what do you think?
Medics: Well, doctor, what's the big idea?
One doctor: Let's see what a little guy can do with an ordinary sponge.
Both: Ooh.
SpongeBob: How do we do?
One: Yeah, us.
Two: Yeah.
[The doctors figure out that Squidward can breathe air with ease.]
One: Yeah, us.
[The doctors figure out that Squidward can't because he's surrounded by normal sea creatures.]
One: Yeah, us.
[The doctors and Squidward wind up at the airsoft store where SpongeBob buys a couple of airsoft helmets.]
SpongeBob: How do we get these?
Hans: How about these?
Hans: Well, what's the big idea?
SpongeBob: [Looks at his watch] One, two, three.
Hans: Never mind. Let's get them.
SpongeBob: Okay. [SpongeBob breaks free]
SpongeBob and Hans: A one-two punch. Got it. [laughs]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Hans on a machine.]
Hans: You can't have that, man. Your machine's been around forever.
SpongeBob: [Humming until the helmet comes off] Oh, that's okay. This is my helmet. Give it a rest. [humming]
Hans: Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Uh, okay. [humming]
[SpongeBob is outside his house humming. Hans is still using his machine to get SpongeBob's attention. SpongeBob and Hans are joined outside by a lawn mower and a police officer.]
Officer Nancy: We're here to make sure you get back in the shower.
Officer Malley: They're gone?
[Officer Nancy pushes a lever.]
The KK: Right this way, please.
[The machine pushes Squidward upstairs. SpongeBob and Hans walk up to the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Okay, we're in. [buckles his hat with the key, pulls his hat-shaped head through the machine, and comes out through the door] I'm glad we worked.
[Squidward is going through the machine in a goofy fashion. Hans is using a dental floss wound around his head. SpongeBob and Hans are shown in a wheelchair. Hans is angry with SpongeBob for messing him up, while Squilliam is shown happily playing with his games. The wheelchair then turns into an exercise room. The wheelchair then slides out and reveals Squilliam sitting on a board with a map.]
Squilliam: Come on. [Squidward walks on down the path]
SpongeBob: Huh? Where's Squilliam?
