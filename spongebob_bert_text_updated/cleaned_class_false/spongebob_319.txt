[The episode begins with a morning at Conch Street. Squidward is coming out of his house with a bunch of stuff.]
Squidward: [sighs] One glorious week [pulls out his keys] without those two...
[Suddenly, SpongeBob and Patrick appear under the RV.]
SpongeBob: Hey!
[Squidward steps on SpongeBob and Patrick and twirl around. Later, Mr. Krabs is in his office with a new batch of Plankton's secret formula.]
Mr. Krabs: Heh, heh.
[SpongeBob peaks through the window and sees that Plankton is nowhere to be seen.]
SpongeBob: Uh-huh! Oh, where do we? [pulls his eyestalk out and sees Plankton running around] Whoa! [grabs the formula] Whoa! [knocks it into the kitchen and jumps on it] Whoo! Split the Krabby Patties! That'll beat this one out of start line. [cut to SpongeBob eating a Krabby Patty and drinking a Krabby soda; cut to SpongeBob standing on his desk looking into a mirror] I hate all of life except for this one. [pulls up the paper and designs Krabby Patties on it] Except this one. What do you call it? [walks up to the grill]
Mr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob. Why, the name's Flankton!
SpongeBob: [giggles] Because this is what I call a Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs: And here's your sundae. [drinks it]
SpongeBob: [drinks from the soda] Thanks. [takes a bite out of the Krabby Patty, then he gasps] I'm taking my retirement...now!
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] Your infirmary! What's this for?
SpongeBob: Well, this is your infirmary. I'll be here ten minutes, then I'll have your formula ready to go. [goes into the kitchen while SpongeBob serves up Krabby Patties, Patrick holds up a tray of condiments, Krabby the Cat takes a bite out of a Krabby burger, then SpongeBob gets the formula out of his nose] Come on, SpongeBob. Ready! [SpongeBob jumps out of his chair while holding up a plate of Krabby Patties] Here you are, sir. Serving the Krusty Krab your delicious Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [Opens the door to let Sponge go] Noggin, what's with the guzzling? Excuse me, but you're not going to see this coming.
SpongeBob: Wait, Mr. Krabs! Before you do this, I want this patties on repeat.
Mr. Krabs: Repeat?
SpongeBob: Repeat?
Mr. Krabs: Repeat?
SpongeBob: TWO PATTIES- THAT!
[cut to the Krusty Krab where Patrick and SpongeBob are serving the patties at the time]
Patrick: Well, Mr. Krabs. You promised us the formula.
 SpongeBob: I didn't know you had it.
Patrick: I didn't know you had it.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. Not even... in my dreams.
Patrick: [Walking off] All right, Clem, what's with the fancy lights?
 Clem: Oh, nothing, my dear, they're just that dim-witted. Nobody's going away. [walks away] Well, Clem, you have to do what's right.
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about? I can't write these lay-offs. Those are my career! And besides, I'll have to give extra money to my friends. My career is ruined! [Whips his face with a napkin] Gosh, maybe I've been sort of a jerk in dreams.
Chimp: Darn! What's that mean? Do they have any dreams?
Mr. Krabs: [Looks at the chimp] Uh, yeah. I'm probably gonna dump you at some point. [Bubbles change the word "Darn" to [Whips his face with a napkin] Bubbles. I don't fit in anywhere. [Whips his face more] I don't hang out. [Whips again] I don't hang out.
Chimp: Darn! What has gotten into you?!
