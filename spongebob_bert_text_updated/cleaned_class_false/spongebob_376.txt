[Episode starts with a shot of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick come up with nuts and bolts to make it come out of the ground. But as they think that they are seeing something, the camera trips and accidentally clips SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob tries to free himself from the clips, but Patrick pulls him away.]

[Patrick's arms go into a car trunk and Patrick screams. The scene returns to him holding an empty can of paint. SpongeBob is screaming again.]
Patrick: [crying] I want this! [turns to SpongeBob] Yeah!
SpongeBob: [tears up the paint can] Yeah.
Patrick: [still crying] I want this to be true.
SpongeBob: [calmly] Well, I'm going back to my manicure routine. Then I'm going to start using regular spray.
Patrick: Spray? Oh, I don't know! It shoots bubbles! [bounces away from the mirror and hits himself in the head] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
SpongeBob: That's it! Now I know what you're doing! [stomps out of the paint can and mumbles] Get out! You're not fooling me!
Patrick: What? What is it?
SpongeBob: I don't know! I'm going to the pet shop and get that painting done now! [jumps out of the can] Hey, it's not that bad! [laughs] I could use a job well in store for this! [trades paint for another painting] Now what am I doing? [tries to get it to flip] Is this enough? I can't quite get the painting I want. I want even more! Wait! I can't get the paint on this! [tries to get it to flip but is unsuccessful] Oh no! Now what am I going to do?
Patrick: Don't worry about it! I've got an idea! [pours water in SpongeBob's glass hits him in the face and flips him upside down] Success!
SpongeBob: Ouch! Now what am I going to do?
Patrick: I know how to get you out!
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick! What am I going to do?
Patrick: I know! What am I going to do?
SpongeBob: I know! What am I going to do?
Patrick: I know! What am I going to do?
SpongeBob: I know! What am I going to do?
Patrick: Uhh... [jumps up into the tub]!
SpongeBob: I know. [jumps out of the tub]
