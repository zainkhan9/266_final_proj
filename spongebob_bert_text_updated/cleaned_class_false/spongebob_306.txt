SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. How's it going?
Squidward: Great, SpongeBob. Why're you all stillwanting to play my game?
SpongeBob: [laughs] You know, Squidward, sooner or later, you've got to give up the game, because your pathetic chances at building a dynasty are gone. Take it from me, of course.
Squidward: [grunts angrily] Of course. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Hey, look, a fan of mine, what makes you so jealous?
Squidward: [holds onto words] I know that there's someone in my life that I don't know, and that's... [shows himself in a magazine] ...bu... GAMERGATE! [giggles]
SpongeBob: Hey, look, he's Squidward. What are you doing here?
Squidward: [looking at a picture of a sandwich] I was just leaving.
SpongeBob: [holding up the Krusty Krab hat] The Krusty Krab hat, sir. Well, this is it. You can make do with your Kelpo all you want, but the real genius of this SpongeBob is precisely why you should join us today.
Squidward: Why?
SpongeBob: Because.
Squidward: Because I like playing the game. [rubs his head on the picture] At least my head is flat. [looks at the picture again] There isn't so much as a speck of peck of peck in your head. You don't matter. [sighs] You might as well join the rest of us, because you're getting a lot more of it this turn. [opens the doors to your room and jumps in] And you don't look any different to me.
SpongeBob: Whoo-hoo. That's a good sign. Squidward, we customers seem kind of busy.
Squidward: Of course. [slams the door] They always do.
Mr. Krabs: Me customers? They always will! [licks his sweat and glances at the customers] Why are you here?
Fred: I'd like to stay.
Squidward: You have any friends you can invite over, besides myself, of course. I'll call you Butterface.
Fred: My friends call me Fred Head. [Holds up a book titled, "Friends Without Friends"]
SpongeBob: So, what are you going to do, buddy?
Bill: I'm gonna hang out with you until I'm sure of something.
SpongeBob: Well, I don't really know.
Bill: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Nuh-uh.
Bill: Okay, pal. [takes SpongeBob by the hand and leads him out of the room] Now please let me introduce myself. [SpongeBob mistakes this for duties and he] Duties.. Uh, I need to talk to Squidward. [SpongeBob goes to reach for a tablecloth] Uh. Hanger for a second. [SpongeBob reaches for a tablecloth but there is a net in the process of getting it. He falls and the glove spins] Oh, Oh, Oh. Bubkes. [crowd chases SpongeBob] Uh, Squidward, I'm afraid you're behind that, that line between "is" and "does?" [Squidward laughs then cuts to SpongeBob continuing his work]
Squidward: You know, this isn't so bad. Just a few more steps. [SpongeBob steps on Squidward's back and heilts his suit]
SpongeBob: That's right. [walks over to the Krusty Krab] I blame this insolence on your zest. [takes the Krab hat off his head] Allow me to remedy this situation. Squidward, I'm afraid you're the one who's footing this bill, not me.
Squidward: What? All right, me money! Allow me to reflate the rooftop meter so we can meet those customers' needs. With merino numbers! [stops and groans in disgust] Oh, no! Having to use a spatula to rattle off the supplies! This is a crisis on the part of the chef!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward. And this is my chance to demonstrate my collective sorry conscience. A chef living in crisis. Having no idea what to do, let alone do.
Squidward: You're it?!
SpongeBob: I'm it! I'm it's me! I'll just come back later to tell you what's wrong!
Squidward: The Chef's tantrum sure is loud.
