[The episode begins with the clam migration. As the clam migration roars at SpongeBob and Patrick's faces, SpongeBob and Patrick growl at each other. The clam migration disappears and there is only a distance between them and the two of them running down the street. The two of them stop and stare at the spot until SpongeBob and Patrick get tired. Cut to nighttime. The clam migration alternates between night and day, but on day it starts with a blue light, then it sweeps away, and it stop for the first time. It then fades to night. The only thing that stands in its way is wind. And that's when it spots SpongeBob. SpongeBob's eyes turn to dust. The scene changes to show SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab. He smiles. He takes one look at Mr. Krabs and see there's more fish in the building than there are customers. He chuckles. He taps on the kitchen door.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, I really thought you were some weirdpicket.
SpongeBob: [He stops chuckling] Well, I was just wondering, Mr. Krabs, can anyone tell me why the Krusty Krab is so full of grease?
Mr. Krabs: Why? I don't know. It's a old pattie story. Some day, I'll show you. [He chuckles evilly. SpongeBob pouts. The scene changes to SpongeBob at the register.] And lastly, I checked, the grease inside the Krusty Krab is so bad, people around the world would pay hundreds of dollars for it. [He stops chuckling and pulls down a hanging lamp. A penny falls off the window and falls on SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: That's funny, I thought it was free.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, well, you see, the Krusty Krab is, like, free only because of you. See, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: That's right, Mr. Krabs. So all profits from these cooking and dining excursions would go to charity.
Mr. Krabs: Give me money?
SpongeBob: No! charity is selfish!
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Well, I don't see how that'll help.
SpongeBob: Well, give me... [He stops chuckling] anything at all.
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Well, I don't see how you're helping anything.
SpongeBob: I'm just glad that's over.
[Mr. Krabs tears in his eyes. The scene changes to SpongeBob at the register. He points to a spot where a netting rises.]
SpongeBob: Hmm? Hmm. [The spot turns into a record player and SpongeBob jumps onto it.] Hmm. Hmm. [He falls on the netting. He sticks his tongue out and falls but falls hard enough for the net to open] Hmm. [Then, he has a choice hand that he so highly recommend.]
SpongeBob: I highly recommend this show!
[SpongeBob runs into the kitchen. He runs into the freezer. He runs up the stairs to the sink and down to the plate microwave. He runs up the stairs to the sink and is about to throw a blob of ice cream at it, but stops when he sees that it's a different ice cream maker. He gets so mad that his eyes shoot open like open fire. He gets so scared that his face turns into the sink.] The sink's for frozen food! [screams and runs out of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [Scene scrolls to the back of the kitchen.] SpongeBob, get this one right.
