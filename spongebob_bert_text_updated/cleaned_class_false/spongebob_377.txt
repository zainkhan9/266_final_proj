[The episode starts with SpongeBob getting ready for bed. He touches his thumb often and it wiggles. He then rubs his thumb all over a bed of soft lettuce. The bed's soft shell pops up and folds itself up like a puffer fish. SpongeBob covers his thumb with a blanket and goes to sleep in his comfortable bed. But as soon as he wakes up, he sees that his thumb is chopped off.]
SpongeBob: Huh? What happened?
Thumb: [groans and painkillers are thrown at it] I cut it off!
SpongeBob: Wha...? What happened?
Thumb: [groans and painkillers are thrown at it] I'm sorry ya had my kind of a thumb, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, you cut it off, Mr. Krabs. It was so out of your hands! You got me all wrong again.
Thumb: [groans and painkillers are thrown at it] I'm sorry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, you're me. What are you doing here? Why are you thumbless?
Thumb: [groans and painkillers are thrown at it] I'm sorry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, you're me. What are you doing here? Why are you thumbless?
Thumb: I'm sorry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm me. What are you doing here?
Thumb: [groans and painkillers are thrown at it] I'm sorry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi. [laughs] I'm glad you had fun, sonny. [laughs and opens the door] Hey, SpongeBob. I know what we should do first. We can't just go home.
Mr. Krabs: What are you saying?
SpongeBob: I'm saying: If we were going to go home, why didn't you say so?
Mr. Krabs: Well, you might say so?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Why not?
Mr. Krabs: Because, Could you show me how to do it?
SpongeBob: Well, I can show you how toâ€” [Mr. Krabs pokes his head through the door and crawls out]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! I need a fork. [the wind blows on his head and he goes out flying back at SpongeBob] Ow.
SpongeBob: [crying] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: It's okay. I promise it won't get in my way. [sobs]
SpongeBob: Okay. Sorry. [cries more]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, come on. Let's go. [SpongeBob cries even louder and faster until Mr. Krabs stops crying. Suddenly, SpongeBob's body is above the water and is surrounded by tentacles that come in contact with the water] Wow. [his mind screen goes blank as his body is in the water. Scene cuts to Squidward's house where Squidward takes off his helmet and walks off as SpongeBob sneaks up on him, then jumps on him as SpongeBob sneaks up on him, then jumps on him again] Creepy. That was probably my Helmet of the Month.
SpongeBob: What? Shame on you.
Squidward: Why? [screams] What is it?
SpongeBob: [sniggerles] It's me old May Day.
Squidward: You're not wearing my stupid... [gets smacked around his head by his two real and one artificial legs] legs!
Mr. Krabs: I knew it! I'm not wearing your stupid... [accidentally makes a Krusty Krab hat with the waxed word KRABBY Krab on it] HURRY!
SpongeBob: Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You came. [he leaves]
Squidward: You may have forgotten how to make a Krabby Patty, but it took years and hundreds of hours of sweat, [gets smacked around his head again by his two real and one artificial legs again by a waxed word] fur covering by a waxed word!
