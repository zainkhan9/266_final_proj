[The episode launches every two weeks at Coda's Dive. The episode launches into an action figure collecting action figure called the Undercover Sailor. The action figure is a clone of Sailor Moon that acts as a sidekick and buys some action figures. The action figure starts collecting action figures and selling them off the streets.]
Announcer: Ahoy, Sailor Moon! What a day!
Sailor #1: [speaking through a megaphone, who then disappears] Who are you and what are you doing with those?
[Sailor #1 and S.T.A.L.K.E.S. come out and try to steal the action figure. S.T.A.L.K.E.S. put the statue back on the shelf and makes a copy of Sailor Moon on it. The copy copies Sailor Moon into one of the Sailor Moon's home planet as described on the paper.]
Announcer: Well, that was a close one! What are you waiting for? Come on, let's go.]
SpongeBob: That's it, I can't do this. This is my only line of work here! This is where I belong! This is my only line of work! This is where I belong! [talking through a megaphone on the back of the action figure, trying to steal it] Come on! You're blocking my view!
Sailor #2: No! Not my only line of work, I'll continue to steal this statue every day! [pushes a button on the back of the statue, which activates the Ice Cream King Statue form an ice cream machine]
SpongeBob: Yes, please! This is my only line of work! No more stealing this statue! No more stealing this statue! No more stealing this statue!
[As the episode ended, the statue of Sailor Moon disappeared from the Krusty Krab but not before knocking over a poster that said "Friends are for Me." The statue slowly slides off the wall and heads back to SpongeBob and Sandy.]
