[The episode begins with a shot of the Galley Grub where Billy and Evelyn are dancing through the oyster pool. The crowd loves the music as they watch old lady Evelyn dance. Billy gets close to the oysters neck and squeezes in. He dances back to the old lady. The crowd loves it as Evelyn is feeding the young and the old ladies enjoy the music.]
Billy: Yee-hee! Yee-hee!
[All of a sudden, a light bulb hits Billy and pops out from the oyster. Billy turns it off and all of a sudden, Billy and popped go from the back of his head to his eyes.]
Billy: Yay! A super darling dried head oyster! A must-have dumpin' pick! No joke! [feels his pickles] Oh-ho, this pickles is special!

[sticks it in his nose] A pickle pickle! [sticks it in Mrs. Puff's nose] I pickle pickle! [sticks it in SpongeBob's eye] I pickle pickle! [sticks it in SpongeBob's head] I pickle pickle!
[Suddenly, the oysters starts growing and expanding. Harold, Squidward, Sandy, Horace, Halber-Lily, Nat, Volpe, Pilar, and others appear. The oysters shrink down to a little more than the normal size. Everyone, is cheering for Neptune and cheering for SpongeBob.]
Sandy: Neptune's seas are changing the way we think. Hah! I better make a way and now as fast as I can!
[Suddenly, the oysters shows signs of an over-expression. It disappears and peels back to normal. The oysters continue to grow and expand. Sandy, Harold, Squidward, Patrick, and SpongeBob appear to be outside in the air. The scene changes to Bikini Atol and the oysters are gone. Sandy and Harold are still there.]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sandy!
[SpongeBob and Sandy are screaming in the air. The oysters stop growing and go back to normal. But they disappear into the air motor and they crash out in random.]
Sandy: [In the air] Alright, SpongeBob, speed it! Jump in, buddy!
SpongeBob: Sandy!
[Sandy pulls the oysters out of her mouth. SpongeBob and Sandy crash into each other and crash in with mysterious noises coming out of their mouths.]

[Squidward, who is annoyed, runs up to Sandy and SpongeBob.]
Squidward: By the power of word... [rips his pants] ...number... [takes out a pencil and draws a number one cent that says "1 time"] ...99 times.
