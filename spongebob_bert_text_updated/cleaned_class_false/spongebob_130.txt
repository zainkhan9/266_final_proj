SpongeBob: [Squidward is dressed as an old-time band manager] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
Squidward: Are you trying to take a fancy to Old Man Squidward?
SpongeBob: That's not what I meant, Patrick. I'm just saying that you have extra cash, and I'd like to get your opinion on how much. [cut to SpongeBob eating some Krabby Patties]
Squidward: Oh, boy. How do I look?
SpongeBob: [hears something behind them] Hey, what's that?
Squidward: What? [eyes look at SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: I think I'm...
Patrick: Shhh! Slow down, Squidward! Look! Way better than that guy!
Squidward: Well, yeah. But I don't look good. He's 6'2, full of soap, and mostly full of lead.
SpongeBob: I know! How do I look?
Squidward: [hears noise] Look, I got the clothes on me. I'm ready!
SpongeBob: I've got nothing on! [Squidward Hide behind a brick wall. Scene cuts to Patrick dressed as a manly navy seaman]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, do you look ready?
Patrick: What? No, I'm not! [screams] I'm not!
SpongeBob: [Saluting] Hi, sir, I look great. [Older Man's Diary] I used to steal so much that I thought it was my duty to copy it. But I've never been able to steal all the things I have. [Old Man's Diary shows the sign saying "PRINT" on the door. The customers are annoyed] My mother had told me to steal before I did. Now I understand. I must be good. Huh? I came to steal, this man's entitled to his books and his clothes from me. [Male voice] Not here! [Old Man's Diary window pans over to show that Mr. Krabs is putting books in Squidward's room] Where is the cabin you used to go to? Steamer used to be a thing, but now it is just a thing where you put things in your carrycases and on the tablesaw. [Old Man's diary shows Squidward speaking] My mother used to go to the doctor's office every day for three years. And then she got sick and she used to cut her vegetables in the kitchen. And then when she was old, she used to dismember her vegetables in the kitchen. [Shows Mr. Krabs' house] And now it's old and dirty...
Patrick: Mr. Krabs, I don't want to be a burden.
Mr. Krabs: [pushes Patrick away] Go easy on her, boy. I'm the king. [cuts to later in the day at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, how could you do this to me?
Patrick: Electronics? Wait, no, this is a joke. I just done get a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Me too. [grabs Patrick's hand]
Patrick: Well, I did get a Krabby Patty, too. [He pushes it and it tastes like garbage]
SpongeBob: But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...
Patrick: Why'd you do that?
SpongeBob: I said quit! And let me make another mistake, now. [throws things on the ground]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [he is annoyed and scared and he walks back toward the Krusty Krab] You'll never get me!
Mr. Krabs: Don't make me go do your own dirty work again, boy!
SpongeBob: You won't go out for lunch, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Why?
SpongeBob: I'm hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Hungry? I said quit! And put me hat on before I go up to the grill!
SpongeBob: Are you sure?
Mr. Krabs: Hungry!
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs puts SpongeBob's hat on his head and walks to the kitchen] Okay, everybody's ready to go in there and make some Krabby Patties.
1. [SpongeBob and Patrick are walking to the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. How's it going?
Patrick: Just like I used to do when I was a boy.
SpongeBob: Squidward said it was his birthday!
