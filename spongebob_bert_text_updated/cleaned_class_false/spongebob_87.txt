Squidward: So, Squidward, how are you today?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm so glad that it's Squidward.
Squidward: Who?
SpongeBob: My old pal, Mr. Krabs. He used to sell these delicious Krabby Patties here at Krabby Patties. [Mr. Krabs walks up to him]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, Ah! Me customers! Your Krabby Patties taste so good! Let me at home, now.
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: You can't have that. You're fired. [clings onto Squidward as he talks to SpongeBob]
Squidward: So, you don't have to worry about getting fired?
SpongeBob: Yep. [laughs] That's the idea! [laughs. Later, SpongeBob and Squidward, now married, walk to the Krusty Krab. A very disappointed Squidward opens it and sees different than before.]
Squidward: Patties? [gasps] Huh?
SpongeBob: Squidward, we can't have anything but the one thing that's Widwardian.
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: We can't have anything but the best. Wid... [is about to say "Brahms", when SpongeBob' eyes shoot into the bag and Mr. Krabs opens the bag like a pen and writes "Brahms" on it] What's that?
Squidward: Why don't you read this?
SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward, I would.
Squidward: Um... Okay.
SpongeBob: Um... Mr. Krabs, this is a very important part of Wid...
Squidward: Um... Krabs...
SpongeBob: Wid...
Squidward: Um... Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Wid...
Squidward: Dr-ow...
SpongeBob: Gosh, Squidward, I'm glad that Mr. Krabs is taking the jellyfish seriously.
Squidward: Yeah. Jellied me faster, SpongeBob. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. [laughs]
Squidward: [running in circles] I wanna be at the Krusty Krab again! [Squidward gets kidnapped by the jellyfish] Why?
SpongeBob: 'Cause Mr. Krabs said I'd never come back.
Squidward: [gets taken by the jellyfish and held there. Gasp!] And I was only a short walk from the Krusty Krab. [SpongeBob and Squidward scream and crashes into the Krusty Krab. The jellyfish come back and start stealing the Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you passed the pick-ax. And how 'bout today?
Squidward: [gets strapped with a blanket and is being held there by Mr. Krabs] Thank Neptune's gears! [continues screaming]
Mr. Krabs: Not the wagon I want, Squidward!
[The hooks on the back of the jellyfish patties SpongeBob and Squidward's clothes fall off]
Squidward: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: And that's how we got all these ridiculous amounts of jellyfish on Bikini Bottom.
[SpongeBob and Squidward's clothes fall onto the grill.]
SpongeBob: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: And didn't you tell us how to cook those patties, too?
Squidward: Cook them? To the jellyfish?
SpongeBob: No. We used bad grease, or bad grease couldingly, ketchuped food.
Mr. Krabs: Could you cook those patties again?
Squidward: No. Could you tell us how to cook those patties?
SpongeBob: Not really.
Mr. Krabs: Then what...]
Squidward: Oh, you mean like uh... a... slow-roasted egg, or a slow-roasted Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Uh, nothing...
Mr. Krabs: ..."slow-roasted egg", or aÂ l...
Squidward: [screams] Jellyfish! Jellyfish! [SpongeBob screams and runs away]
SpongeBob: My best friend and I are going off to college together.
[SpongeBob and Squidward sit in a corner of the room]
SpongeBob: En garde!
[Karen comes in and shuts the door]
SpongeBob: En garde!
