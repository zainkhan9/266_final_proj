[The episode begins with a morning at Bikini Bottom. A blue cloud comes up and looms larger.]
Cloud: Attention! For my friend SpongeBob's sick date, I have decided to give him one more chance. We will, however, only be able to meet this unfriendly giant through his own means, which are too narrow. Only by understanding and accepting my differences will he be made whole. [the silhouette of Squidward appears] Hey, Squidward, appreciate your new home.
Squidward: Huh?
[Squidward screams and runs away.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] This is the man?! I have made him into a monster! I will, indeed! [the screen fades to black.] So long, sweet Neptune!
[The screen fades to black as the episode ends.]
SpongeBob: Goodbye, little punctual fry cook. Aw, I'm going away to go get my fix of pizza. [runs into Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs, you forgot another treat.
Mr. Krabs: Why, me too, wee Bob.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, nothing's going on here!
Mr. Krabs: Uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Why, the lad's missing out on the best day of his life, which is Monday, because he's losing his job.
SpongeBob: The road doesn't end here, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs is missing out on the best day of his life, which is Monday, because he's losing his pizza sales.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] He's got to give up that one back home.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is going to miss you too, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob walks away]
SpongeBob: Good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: ...and you'll be on your way.
SpongeBob: Wait! Don't go anywhere while I leave you here, Mr. Krabs. Soon, you'll be saved! [Mr. Krabs wonders where he is. Inside, he opens a door, and Mr. Krabs sees it is a door only to a 'WELCOME HOME' sign] Here we are. Home on the town. [walks into a Krusty Krab door that leads to a building, and sees an employee there]
Hortonia: I think you've found the place.
Health Inspector: Happy camping, a hungry customer.
Squidward: Happy camping?! Then remind me, how do you get over there?
Mr. Krabs: [enters and gasps] Doesn't make much sense, Mr. Squidward, but I am here, and I brought some cookies.
Squidward: [starts walking to the Krusty Krab] These are delicious! [Mr. Krabs starts laughing outside] I guess it's just back to the drawing board.
Health Inspector: [offscreen] Welcome home, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [As he is leaving, another Krusty Krab employee knocks on the front door] Hey, that's another customer.
Health Inspector: Hello, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [Gasps] Not this time! [runs out of the Krusty Krab through the back door, impressing himself with the work]
Health Inspector: Or what's with the tin foil?
Mr. Krabs: Just getting my license.
Health Inspector: Or the license would have been a plus.
Mr. Krabs: What license do you have?
Health Inspector: Your license. I only need a little background on the laws in town.
Mr. Krabs: [gulps] I can't let anyone take my license away! It has got to go to the trash. [The inspector walks over to the trash can, grabs his license and goes to destroy it]
Health Inspector: Or maybe there's something dangerous in here. I'll just have to check to see if it's really there. [Pushes the inspector to the trash can] Whatever you do, don't look at it!
[SpongeBob and Squidward are driving on the shoulder. SpongeBob looks out the window and notice there is a giant sink]
SpongeBob: Hey, what's going on here?
Mr. Krabs: I'm afraid there's two results of this mistaken guess. First, there's this sink. Hmm, a second sink. I don't know why. [Mr. Krabs gets a hair dryer and swats the sink away]
