SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Patrick! Patrick! Oh, boy, did you hear that, did you? Patrick! Oh, boy! [both hug]
Patrick: SpongeBob, oh, boy! What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Can you hands make a ladder of this?
Patrick: Yeah, come on.
SpongeBob: How long have you been holding those cans?
Patrick: Uhh... Hey, SpongeBob, did you hold that can? I... hold those canesaws! They're mine all over Mr. Krabs' house and all my money!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs' money?
Patrick: Yeah, yeah, me and all my money. Now, how much you got?
SpongeBob: Nothing, yeah, no time now.
Patrick: Well, what's this about your house that you're not using?
SpongeBob: I had it both ways, duh. The canesaws is mine.
Patrick: Well, I thought you said you could borrow it?
SpongeBob: I... spoke how I like it. It's my, my only money.
Patrick: Why, thank, uh, well, um, uh, well, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. [notices canes that are missing] That means Mr. Krabs has found the canes which you stole!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I just can't do it! I gotta do something!
[cuts to later where Mr. Krabs is walking into the restaurant]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? What the barnacles is going on out there?! [gasps] This isn't happening! I told you to pound those canes, I'm gonna—
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Patrick! Pound them! [cuts to Mr. Krabs carrying the food Patty around] I'm gonna keep going! Pound 'em! [cuts to SpongeBob carrying the salad on top of the can] OK, PATRICK, I'M WITH YOU, I'VE SINN. [stops in front of the canes] SpongeBob, would you please just-- stop— this? This isn't— this isn't happening! Patrick, do we really have to go back to the Krusty Krab? [pounds the doors] It's not gonna happen? [pounds the doors harder] No! [knocks the salad down]
Patrick: Well, sure it's a relief. But it is a relief nonetheless.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what's that in those red, smelly, canes? It's the gnarliest, most disgusting, most disgusting food ever—
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Oh, it's disgusting. It's really disgusting.
Mr. Krabs: [gulps] Uhh... What do you mean disgusting?
SpongeBob: It's absolutely disgusting!
Patrick: [whispers] It's very, very bad.
Mr. Krabs: [whispers] Did somebody use a... word salad?
SpongeBob: [in a word salad] Ehh... word salad.
Mr. Krabs: [whispers] Er... is this really—
SpongeBob: [whispers] Krabs, I think we really have to ask you to open these TWO doors!
Mr. Krabs: [whispers] Whoa—whoa!
[cuts to the canes that end up at the Krusty Krab doors]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! Canes, come out! I'm a big boy! [SpongeBob knocks on the door and the door opens] Canes? I need a job! [Mr. Krabs sighs] Sure, I'll just come out and get a job. Call me any time, Mr. K. [Mr. Krabs sighs, SpongeBob rings the doorbell and SpongeBob walks out the Krusty Krab] Canes? Come out and get a job. Hmmm... I know my place now. Mmm... I'll just stay in school until high school is done.
Mr. Krabs: [in his office] Mmm. [walks out the door] Another day, another dollar. Mmm.
[cut to next day where Mr. Krabs is writing on a notepad]
