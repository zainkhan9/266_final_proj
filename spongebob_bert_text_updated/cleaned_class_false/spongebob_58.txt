Mr. Krabs: Well, I need new customers. That's all.

[Fred starts to leave, but makes it rung. Mr. Krabs comes in.]
Mr. Krabs: Eugene, I did it. I can finally give these little folk my all.
Fred: [closes bathroom door] Wha-what?
Mr. Krabs: I just want to make sure you all had fun.
[Mr. Krabs gives Fred three balloons.]
Fred: Wow!
Mr. Krabs: And put you in charge of the... uh, the bath.
[Mr. Krabs starts to cry.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, why yes... 
[Mr. Krabs starts sobbing again.]
Squidward: What am I gonna do to deserve all this social and financial largesse?
Mr. Krabs: [sniffs] What am I gonna do to me?
[Mr. Krabs continues to cry on the floor of his office, until he trips on a book and breaks his fingers. He continues to cry on the floor, while the other workers are unable to hold him. Mr. Krabs flips the covers over his broken fingers back onto the floor.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, boys. Whatever you want, we'll give you everything we have.
SpongeBob: [while picking up Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy balloons] Even though we're little, we have something in common. We only need 52 more minutes to make it.
Patrick: Can I make it 52 more minutes?
Mr. Krabs: No.
SpongeBob: Okay. Anything for the break.
[SpongeBob puts the balloons into his head, and swims out.]
Squidward: Where are we? We can't leave this island unscathed!
Mr. Krabs: [hands him the balloons] $5, $7, $10, $12, $14, $15.
[Squidward drops the balloons. The scene changes to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob going into a submarine. Mr. Krabs puts two wires into the end of the submarine.]
Mr. Krabs: One, please. Two, please.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Squidward. Mr. Krabs paces back and forth in the submarine. As he finally grabs ahold of the end of the submarine, he whacks it on the helmet with his tail.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, me boy Scott. How ya doing out here?
SpongeBob: Well, I'm good.
[SpongeBob and Squidward scream and run outside. Mr. Krabs paces back and forth in the submarine. He sees SpongeBob and Squidward tied to a rope. He sees Mr. Krabs head down in a chair.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boy! I'm sorry to tell youin' you're a big mistake, boy. [He is upside-down and Squidward out of the picture]
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry, too! [He turns the submarine upside-down and closes his legs] I'm so glad you're all safe.
[SpongeBob and Squidward get out of the submarine.]
Mr. Krabs: But what about the truth?
Squidward: Oh, nothing really, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Good day, Mrestray Squidward! [Mr. Krabs lets go of Squidward's head, and all of his tentacles go into Squidward's mouth. A helicopter bellows] Clear the rubble!
