SpongeBob: [as Sandy walks up] Sandy? Sandy's here! Hi, Sandy. How's my favorite movie happening?
Sandy: [sitting at the table with friends at the beach] It's "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galley Club." I love it.
SpongeBob: [jumps in] It's "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galley Club."
Sandy: [sighs] It's "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galley Club." I love it! [walks up to SpongeBob] When I'm with you, we fold our own yarn.
SpongeBob: Why'd you do that?
Sandy: I was "the" one.
SpongeBob: Wh-wh-why?
Sandy: because...
SpongeBob: "The" one! Because I like it! Because it's "The" one! Because it's "The" one!
Sandy: Wh-why?
SpongeBob: Because, uh, [growls and sniffs air] it's "The" one!
Sandy: Huh?
SpongeBob: Whoa! Why'd you eat that?!
Sandy: I'm asking you, SpongeBob, you take the book belt and follow the books, right here! [SpongeBob takes the book belt and dips it into the water, but the worms ate the sand and spanned all the way through the trees, which they did, revealing that the sand was eaten by Patrick's worms, who were sitting here eating their food]
Patrick's Worm: No!
SpongeBob: [Throws the book in the air, blasting them out]
Sandy: That was no ordinary popcorn. It was "THE GUATO MAN!" [Waves 'em all over.]
Patrick's Worm: No! [Waves another book belt which flies over to SpongeBob and grabs SpongeBob, soaking them]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Sandy. Say, what happened to the book?
Sandy: You know where you're going. Book, paper, pencil. How about a handshake? [She writes "Mr. Krabs" on the stack of money in her bag]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey there, girl. Did you get anything? [She starts to laugh]
SpongeBob: [Eating the book] Thank you. [He walks off]
Sandy: Well, that's "The Guy Who Doesn't Have a Book." I guess I should call him "The Kooky King." I guess that title would go to... [She starts to laugh] [She starts to laugh with tears in her voice] ...the one who doesn't have a book. [The crowd stops]
Mr. Krabs: [Opens book, revealing not only a title, but also an invention note and the words "Man, Paper, Shotgun" as well. He chuckles] Now that's the kind of material that gets through to an author like me!
SpongeBob: You know, I don't think book-hoarding holds any secrets.
Sandy: Well, how do you know about book-hoarding?
SpongeBob: Well, I have... uh... my life is a living nightmare! [He yelps] I'm going to jail! [He is playing with his jellyfishing net. A prison truck pulls over and passengers are still being held for violating this rule. A log with a picture of Monroe Badger shows Monroe Badger with his eye injuries. The truck drives off. SpongeBob runs to the gate] Please, who is violating this rule?
Sandy: [SpongeBob puts on the tin can, opens it, and talks] Everybody, read the Book of Morons. If Monroe Badger gets away, we'll prison him forever!
SpongeBob: This is one book. If Badger gets away, we'll put him in me wallet. [He hands Sandy his pants. Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab about to open. It is dark inside and the sign says "COPY" around the doors. The sign says "NO" on the sign reading Opens the Door next to the Window. Sandy walks up to the counter with her hands behind her back. She holds up her ketchup bottle.]
Sandy: Huh? Mm, a can? I'll get ya. [She opens the window. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs run out of the Krusty Krab] They'll never know what's inside, Mr. Krabs. I'll protect them both!
Mr. Krabs: It'll be all right, Sandy. Just be careful with the over-the-top stuff, SpongeBob.
