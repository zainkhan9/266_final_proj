[Lights are circling outside the Krusty Krab. Inside, the Krusty Krab is having a lot of trouble. People are getting into the bathrooms.]
Mr. Krabs: I would guess so. [Mr. Krabs checks the locks] Who's complaining here? [Suddenly, SpongeBob bursts in] Mr. Krabs, why are you so darn paranoid, and whatnot, I'm all over SpongeBob? [SpongeBob runs into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what is wrong with me kitchen?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I've always wanted to go to the Krusty Krab. But what's the holdup with the new sign in the kitchen?
SpongeBob: I've never been afraid.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what do you think? Is this the Krusty Krab where I lose my cool, if I stay here all night? [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs get into a fight] Help! Help! [SpongeBob lets out a bloodthirsty rage and lets out a blaster and lets out a laugh at each other. Then he shoots his laser at the fryers. SpongeBob starts to sweat] Wait, SpongeBob, don't go! Don't go! You were saying...
SpongeBob: Wait! [Mr. Krabs starts a tantrum that leads to him banging his head on the kitchen counter. He screams and runs out. Mr. Krabs starts to panic] Wait, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob walks over to the counter, but bounces off someone's shopping list at random. Mr. Krabs starts to get annoyed] Wait, SpongeBob! Wait, SpongeBob! Wait, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob falls down to the floor] Wait... [He falls down to the floor and sticks his tongue out. Mr. Krabs starts to notice something] Wait a second... [he changes the "Bring Your Pet" box back to the box he left earlier. He closes the box and returns it to his] Oh, my Krusty Krab. The most exciting, most exciting place to eat in all of Bikini Bottom. [He walks back into the kitchen, grabs his tongue, and faces the box] Wait a second. It's not "Krabby Patties" again. [He walks back into the kitchen, grabs his tongue again. Mr. Krabs starts to notice something] Oh, I can't stay mad. I'm not hungry. [He switches the "Bring Your Pet" sign on. He goes back into the kitchen] No need to get excited. This is my first time using "big screen." [As Mr. Krabs walks over, SpongeBob is going his separate ways while muttering. [Pets a box]
SpongeBob: [As he moves his puppet box beside him] I don't have a home, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What? What's wrong with it?
SpongeBob: It's the same old SpongeBob! Different packaging. Smells exactly like him. Runs the same brand more times than not.
Mr. Krabs: That's enough, you're here. Everything's the same. How about some fries?
SpongeBob: I have fries, sir. [Mr. Krabs throws the fries into SpongeBob's mouth and puts a cotton swab] They're all yours, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob's face turns blue as he picks up the fries. Mr. Krabs grabs the fries and puts them in his mouth] They're all yours, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs puts the fries into SpongeBob's mouth and goes back into SpongeBob's head. He tries to pick out the fries, but they stick. Mr. Krabs throws them in SpongeBob's mouth and goes back into SpongeBob's head. He pulls out his swollen bottom.] Okay, okay, let's get out of here. [He takes a deep breath and spits it out. As he walks out, SpongeBob's head turns into a square. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Gary outside of the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Well, I can't go out all that easily, Gary. [SpongeBob's eyes turn into squared off faces. He yells angrily. Gary walks up to SpongeBob.] Well, that's just fine, Gary. As long as it's not with that sharp-witted, green-tinged, nasty-necking, lanky-headed... hunk! [Gary follows SpongeBob upstairs.]
SpongeBob: Oh, what do I do? What do I do? [Patrick appears]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
