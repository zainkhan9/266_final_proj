Narrator: Epilogue.
SpongeBob: [turns off the TV] Good night, Patrick.
Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [turns on the TV] I can't wait for you to latinize! 
Narrator: Good night, Patrick.
SpongeBob: [turns off the TV] Good night, Patrick.
Patrick: Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [turns on the TV] I can't wait for you to latinize! [licks the "Good night, " goodnight. Starts laughing. Ballad I have long since forgotten begins. Music stops, and then, the scene cuts to the Krusty Krab. The exterior looks very fancy, as seen from the boat here. We then see a busy register, walkway, elevator, and even outside the register boat. Walkway is very busy, as is the lifting machine. See how they walk?
Mr. Krabs: Mm-hmm.
SpongeBob: How long have you been spying on us, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: All along.
Squidward: What are you doing here?
SpongeBob:  [points at Squidward] We just want to steal some of his perfumes.
Squidward: Oh, that's what I said.
SpongeBob: [sings] There's something exquisite about his brown curls.
Squidward: You really think so, aren't you?
SpongeBob: I do, Mr. Krabs. I once took half of his walnuts and gave him half of mine. He never would've gotten those halves if we had only known what you said.
Mr. Krabs: You're making this up! You're not letting me do my job!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is in his underwear, also in underwear] I'm not letting you do your job, Mr. Krabs. You're undermining my authority!
Mr. Krabs: I'm not doing it for the money.
SpongeBob: Money?
Mr. Krabs: [screams] The Krusty Krab is now a money-tanking restaurant! And your lunch?
SpongeBob: Not just any lunch, Mr. Krabs. a.k.a., Fred's Meal. [SpongeBob takes out his wallet and pulls out a Krabby Patty] Any lunch size, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, this isn't money, it's moneyti, [Mr. Krabs puts a the Krabby Patty on Fred's plate and walks back to SpongeBob] what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: It's right here at Papa Bob's.
Mr. Krabs: What're you doing here, boy?
SpongeBob: Oh, what are you doing here, Krab?
Mr. Krabs: What's this, [points to his chest] huh? Your gold mine to spend!
SpongeBob: I've been trying to put it, but I'm not letting go.
Mr. Krabs: I was just here to buy you a little something personal for your little-fun.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not what this is, Krabs. It's me: Pirate Treasure.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'm not your friend. You're about me and your friends. Don't let anyone take your treasure away!
[cut to the Krusty Krab where Patrick and Squidward walk into the restaurant]
Patrick: I've got some much needed rest. [Squidward hands Patrick a wallet]
Squidward: You got some, Patrick?
Patrick: I thought I told you how it was.
Squidward: How is it, my dear, why don't you just get back to the Krusty Krab?
Patrick: We can discuss that at the dinner party.
Mr. Krabs: And why don't you just take a load off? [gives Patrick a phone and calls the Mailfish]
Mailfish: Mailfish.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, the cat out of the bag, Mr. Squidward. [throws the phone out of the mailbox] I am ready, I'm ready to go back to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Time to pack our bags, Mr. Krabs. We're all packing.
Mr. Krabs: Can't we pack too much?
SpongeBob: We can't cram too much.
Mr. Krabs: That's something.
Squidward: Okay, that's it.
Mr. Krabs: There you are, your clothes are all packed.
