[The episode starts with SpongeBob coming into the kitchen of the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is still talking to his son, about whom SpongeBob wrote up a letter.]
Mr. Krabs: [gleefully giggles and grabs the letter] It has to go to SpongeBob. [writes his letter through a megaphone and into the kitchen sink, where he is about to ingest it] Your daughter, Pearl.
[The letter lands on the patty.]
SpongeBob: Mom! No! [pushes the plate with the melted chocolate ice cream inside and the plate grabs it with his teeth. He comes back up with the ice cream and eats it with his teeth. He finishes the patty and then his teeth scream for help. SpongeBob runs to the grill with the ice cream. He does so and gets it with his teeth, so he eats it with his teeth. He then gets his teeth back on the plate and it sinks down into the sink.]
Mr. Krabs: What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: I can't take the heat! [takes a grill screwdriver and screws it on the top of the head; he then screws on the wooden plank holding the ice cream with his teeth] This must be the oven! [shuts the door behind him] Or the hot sink! [shuts the sink behind him] Or the tongue for that matter! [shuts the wooden plank holding the ice cream with his teeth]
Mr. Krabs: What the barnacles is going on here?!
SpongeBob: [panting] I was just checking to make sure my little Pearl was healthy and not rancid. [sees a note under the ice cream] Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs. It's time for the...
Mr. Krabs: The Krusty Krab Epilogue! Epilogue! Epilogues are always funny!
SpongeBob: [reading the note] Dear Mr. Krabs, I'm having a little trouble keeping up with the other kids in the household. I want me to have fun with those bucks, but I also know it's fun or...
Mr. Krabs: Uh-huh. [pulls a switch that launchesiny into the air]
Children: [cheered up] Fun?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. [uses the megaphone and speaks into a megaphone] Fun.
SpongeBob: [gets smacked in the face with the megaphone] Ow! [gets smacked back in the face with the megaphone] Ow! [gets smacked in the face again with the megaphone] Ow! [gets smacked in the face again with the megaphone] Ow!
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Smear juice?
SpongeBob: [growls and smacks the megaphone with his hat] You got me, Mr. Krabs! [Squidward is behind him]
Squidward: [shivering] My hair!
SpongeBob: Relax, Squidward. It's the law in Bikini Bottom. It's the law of the sea. Do as you're told. Jump straight to the Krusty Krab.
Squidward: The what?
Mr. Krabs: I consent to speak to Mr. Krabs of course.
SpongeBob: [speaks Bikini Bottom] Hey, Squidward! It's time!
Squidward: [shivering] My hair!
SpongeBob: [speaks Krusty Krab] Yeah, yeah, Krabs is in, hey, Squidward. We can ask: your man, Mr. Krabs, or your little sausage. [hits the patties with his club]
Squidward: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [speaks Krusty Krab] Look, Squidward, we're having a great time at the Krusty Krab.
Squidward: Yeah.
SpongeBob: [speaks Krusty Krab] Look, would you mind getting a look at what look so many famous people wear on their jobs? [Squidward blows into the megaphone]
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, Squidward, we can't.
SpongeBob: Interesting. You spoke quite a lot today.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, are you gonna let me start holding my breath today?
SpongeBob: Ooh, boy, that is quite a fancy way of saying "accepting" a favor.
Mr. Krabs: You are a famous person. That's why you get to be famous. You don't have to do all that much work, you might as well embrace me as someone special.
