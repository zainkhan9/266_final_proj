[Opens the episode's title screen with a light. A giant robot with wings emerges from the water, singing and chewing. The scene changes to shown. The giant robot flies over to Squidward's house and finishes eating his meals, then starts eating his own. It fades away and it backs up. It starts chewing, chewing, and walking backwards. The scene changes to show the exterior of Squidward's house. Squidward is in his bathtub, humming. His door opens and his arm pops out of the bathtub. The scene shifts to show the front of Squidward's door.]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Hello, Squidward! I'm SpongeBob SquarePants. I'm your big-time friend, Squidward. [laughs] So,. how are you doing today?
Squidward: [yawns] No, getting back to work.
[At SpongeBob's house, the scene changes to show the front of Squidward's house. Squidward is standing right outside his door, whimpering. He peers out the window.]
SpongeBob: I am, sir. And let me help you with your luggage.
Squidward: [growls] No, no—that's all right. I'm so sorry, mind if I use the—
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] He gets in front of me, he gets free rein to be who he wants. [Squidward widens his eyes] There you are, Squidward. Want anything to the bat? [Squidward Takes a deep breath and breathes loudly] Anything?
Squidward: [sighs heavily] I'm sorry, but my air is down. I'm a snail!
[At SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Squidward are standing in front of a painting that says Squidward was a...mouse. Squidward moans and the camera zooms in to see that painting is the one that Squidward screams in. The painting skids away and shows a dark figure eight with a shell on top. Squidward moans in and the shell gets in his eyes. The other paintings like it is gone, and it is the same figure. Squidward moans in fear and the camera zooms in to show a skull with a mouse in it. The other paintings show the shell getting in and out. Squidward screams in fright, and the camera zooms in to show a head with a second shell]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Oh, hello! I'm SpongeBob.
Squidward: SpongeBob? I need to talk to this mouse.
SpongeBob: Uh, well, uh, [takes off his hat and starts to walkie-talkie] I think I can name the man who just stole my best friend, Squidward!
Squidward: I've got to be more careful, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Squidward! You're not getting it, Squidward. I'm getting it...from inside you.
[Squidward starts to walk away, and the camera zooms in to the hallway that SpongeBob just left. Squidward starts to cry, and the camera zooms in to the hallway]
SpongeBob: Squidward, it's for you.
[Squidward starts to walk out, and SpongeBob gets in front of him.]
SpongeBob: Thank you, Squidward.
[Squidward continues to cry. The camera zooms in to another hallway that leads to a room that's made entirely out of battle stations. The doors are made out of tin cans, and the wires are cut out from these tin cans. Squidward walks in, and the camera starts toOSE over to a loudspeaker that's being used for Voice Chat.]
Squidward: So, are you getting a fair shake now?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, I am getting a fair shake. [laughs]
Squidward: [laughs] Look, it's for you.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Squidward.
Squidward: That's not so- [gets removed]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, I'm not fair! [punches Squidward in the face]
Nat Peterson: [off-screen] Sorry. [camera zooms out to a view of the Krusty Krab that shows Squidward's house in right portrait shot] We saved you some headache, Squidward.
Squidward: Now it's your turn!
[Squidward kicks SpongeBob in the face, getting the cash register and reading it in the near wall of the Krusty Krab]
The Krusty Krab: This fine one is money in the form of a dollar.
