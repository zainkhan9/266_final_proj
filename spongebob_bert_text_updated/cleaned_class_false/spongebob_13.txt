[It is raining outside and SpongeBob is getting ready to put the gift on his head. Patrick comes up with a watering can and waters SpongeBob watering holes all over the place. He goes to one of the watering holes with flowers and SpongeBob falls in. He bites on it and spits it out. He goes over to the other watering hole and spits out another. SpongeBob then falls into another hole and spits out more flowers. He then goes to the first watering hole and spits out a bunch of flowers for Patrick to poop on. He then climbs up to the top, and spits out more flowers for Patrick to poop on. Patrick then goes back down to the ground and spits out more flowers for SpongeBob to poop on.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I am much too simple a man to be a gift horse for Mr. Sun. [walks to the front of the boat and pours himself some milk] Hey, Patrick. Guess I can rub myself right? [SpongeBob is too big for the shoe]
Patrick: Uh, yeah, I think I'd rub myself.
[SpongeBob goes to the back]
SpongeBob: [hands Patrick the milk] Mr. Gift, will ya join me?
Patrick: Sure. [gives him the shoe]
SpongeBob: Here you go, Patrick. Gift to Mr. Sun. [gives Patrick the shoe]
Patrick: Thanks, Sun-Man. [gives SpongeBob the shoe]
SpongeBob: Come here, Patrick. Please. [gives Patrick the shoe]
Patrick: Yay, Mr Gift! [gives SpongeBob the shoe and Patrick the shoe off their backs; he gives them to Patrick's for his shower] Yay, Mr. Gift! [gives Patrick the shoe and SpongeBob the shoe but they are stuck in his ribc and don't move. Scene cuts to Patrick putting the shoe on his head, but sees the shoe is not there] Huh? Where's it going? Hello? Mystery. [sees Patrick's shoe all over himself and screams] Mystery, that hurts! Oh, Mystery, you're welcome. [scene cuts to the Barg'N-Mart. Patrick is still screaming as he is given the shoe] Whee!! Nice job. [sees SpongeBob giving Patrick gifts] SpongeBob? [SpongeBob walks into a stall and picks up a Krabby Patty, a bottle of ketchup, a box of Kelpo, and a box of ice cream. Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs lying on the floor in a fetal position, with a can of soda on top of his head, the can spins around, and   his eyes are shaped like eyes. SpongeBob walks up to him]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [walks up with a can of soda] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Can you tell my customers how much free Krabby Patties they get?
SpongeBob: Well, according to Mr. Krabs, when you give them free Krabby Patties...
Mr. Krabs: Uh, okay. [takes one look at them for his opinion and one doesn't]
SpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs, have you ever noticed how underpriced Krabby Patties are?
Mr. Krabs: Well, um, well, yeah. Uh, well I guess just like the customers.
SpongeBob: Well, uh, well maybe.
Mr. Krabs: Well, uh, you know, what I've noticed is just the opposite of outrageous: the opposite of bid-buy. A person could afford to buy a Krabby Patty, and a different Patty, and cheese. And the other thing.
SpongeBob: What's opposite, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: Exactly. You would not be able to afford the opposite opposite opposite opposite— [shakes his head] opposite— [SpongeBob. SpongeBob stands out, holding a sandwich.] Patty.
SpongeBob: I don't understand.
Mr. Krabs: Oh yes, it is.
SpongeBob: Well, I didn't buy anything.
Mr. Krabs: Oh yeah. Right where you think? I don't have anything. [gives SpongeBob the sandwich]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, boy. I knew it.
Mr. Krabs: Careful now. You wanna eat this?
SpongeBob: Actually, I have a hot date with my... [close-up of SpongeBob's face] …Sunset.
Mr. Krabs: Gosh. SpongeBob, you're not buying anything?
