[The episode begins with an exterior shot of the Krusty Krab. Squidward is shown wearing a blue Krusty Krab hat with a red bowtie. He pulls out a small SpongeBob puppet.]
Squidward: Hello, SpongeBob. Nice to meet you. [SpongeBob giggles] I'm ready!
[The SpongeBob shows Squidward the key to the restaurant, which turns out to be the office of Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob and Squidward walk into Mr. Krabs' office. The pipsqueak stops and Squidward's arm falls off. Squidward sees the key and freaks out.]
Squidward: [runs over to the door] What theâ€”!?
[Mr. Krabs shuts the door with a plank. SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Mr. Krabs* walk in. They put Mr. Krabs down onto the floor and SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs get into a taxi. Mr. Krabs jumps in the air and SpongeBob takes Squidward's side on the coffin.]
Mr. Krabs: One more drop of mustard, and I'll be in me money. [SpongeBob smiles]
[Squidward pushes Squidward in the coffin and drives off. The scene changes to Squidward and SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab's cash register. Inside the register, SpongeBob gives one of the register's hooks a penny.]
SpongeBob: One more drop of mustard, and I'll be in me money! [SpongeBob and Squidward laugh. The scene changes to Squidward reading a book in a little book shop. SpongeBob and Squidward walk into the register boat and sit down.] SpongeBob, these are the hooks for the mustard capsule capsule... [SpongeBob and Squidward laugh. The scene changes to Squidward and SpongeBob relaxing in the kitchen.] Perfectly warmed. Good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Look, SpongeBob, mustard's a special pride. Squidward will never find out about it.
SpongeBob: Oh. Uh, I forgot. I forgot the password. [opens the capsule door and leaves]
Mr. Krabs: Good night, Squidward. [SpongeBob and Squidward walk out of the kitchen. The scene changes to Squidward and SpongeBob sitting at a table together.] Good as new, huh?
Squidward: How about a shot of the bilious rivers?
SpongeBob: Okay. [shot of the great river Amoeba]
Narrator: 72 hours later...
[The scene changes to Squidward and SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab's cash register. Customers are declining its cash register money order.]
SpongeBob: I can't. It's too expensive.
Nat: Do you want to order something?
Squidward: Just one thing. Tell me more information.
Nat: Uh, can I have less?
SpongeBob: Oh, more is just the same.
Nat: Well, I... I don't know what you're talking about. Why don't you just walk me home and I won't... [Nat walks away]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] What did you say?! I'm not Italian, I'm not a dweeb!
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, um, your fish paste is blunted and modified by my environment by use of extra fur and/or hops!
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] How are you two airbrushed from me lair?! You smell that?!
Squidward: It's called airbrushing. I took it upon myself.
Mr. Krabs: Airbrushing?
Squidward: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! I wouldn't do it! Not at all!
Mr. Krabs: Get away! Get away!
Squidward: [silently] Don't tell me. Why don't you two go on a little adventures?
SpongeBob: Adventure?
Squidward: Oh, this is silly. Where are we going?
Mr. Krabs: What?
Squidward: To the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: Krusty Krab?
Squidward: That's not Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: Oh.
SpongeBob: [sticks a map on Mr. Krabs' map] We're going to the Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: Oh.
SpongeBob: We're going to the Krusty Krab?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you want to go to the Krusty Krab?
