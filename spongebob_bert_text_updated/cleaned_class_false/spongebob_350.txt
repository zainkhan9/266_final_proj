[episode starts with Mr. Krabs flipping patties and has hair]
Mr. Krabs: Whoo-hoo! [episode ends] 
SpongeBob: Gosh, Mr. Krabs, that didn't look too bad. I guess that plays off of SpongeBob's excellent acting. Yeah! [laughs] 
Mr. Krabs: All right, look at this. It's a bun cut in the style of Fredrick Star-- [cut to a crowd of spectators cheering in excited] ♪ I don't care 'cause I've never been to a gym '-- ever! -- Ever! 
[cut to outside of the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: We don't even know it's there, now! 
[cut back to the exterior of the Krusty Krab, where SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are dancing around]
SpongeBob: Well, we're all better. Better than all of you! And you weren't even close. What were you doing standing around? 
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about? [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are sitting down] 
SpongeBob: I've been there, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs runs over] You're the face of stinky Krusty Krab! [Mr. Krabs squeals, then jumps back to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs dancing across the Krusty Krab] 
Mr. Krabs: Now, think of it as art! And art isn't just about the [looks at work] ♪ / Of course! ♪ 
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. Well, okay. I got a little competition here today. [They start to walk away, as Mr. Krabs sobs] 
SpongeBob: I'm sorry I'm interrupting your good friend's performance. So, what do you say? Anything for my good friend, I guess? [Mr. Krabs cries] 
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Hey, what are you doing crying time? The business must really, really in trouble. Let me just set you straight to the quadrants. [chuckles] Uhh, oh, I know, you're not just with those liars, you cheapskate! 
SpongeBob: [cries] What am I gonna do? I can't do this, Mr. Krabs. 
Mr. Krabs: That's right. When you get caught in a crime, you can get away with it. Yes, there are times when I've got to let you go, but all you do is make you promise. Now, let's see. How do you spell "failing"? [SpongeBob's brain uses a small, slow, useless spell] Uhh... Uh... Uh... Okay. [spins the small, slow, useless spell again] 
SpongeBob: How about this one? Let's see, it's a simple, but effective, one-shot spell. 
Mr. Krabs: Exactly! And for every failure, there was one improvement. 
SpongeBob: [tries to make a spell with his left hand] How about this one? Let's see, it's a two-shot spell? 
Mr. Krabs: Exactly! And for every improvement, there was one defeat. [tries to make a spell with his right hand] 
SpongeBob: That's right! And for every setback, there was an defeat. [holds up a tape cassette] Allow me to demonstrate, please. [shows the tape cassette] Uh... A cassette tape. [picture of Mr. Krabs mouth looks] Being a failure manager. Ever so slightly depressed face. [looks at his failing face and sighs] Well, I've got a confession to make. [starts walking away] I made an embarrassing error. 
[Later] 
Patrick: [screams] Oh, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob: [runs up to a ceiling fan] Phew! I did it! I did it! I made an embarrassing error! En garde! [fanfare plays] 
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, will you get off of me?! Curse you! [crashes into a lamp] 
SpongeBob: This is your light bulb. Allow me to demonstrate. [turns on the light bulb] 
Patrick: How do you spell "good luck"? 
SpongeBob: Try it! 
Patrick: That's it.
