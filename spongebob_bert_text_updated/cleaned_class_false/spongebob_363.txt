[It is night time in Bikini Bottom. A scallop crows like a rooster. Scallop crows. Scallop crows like a scallop cower. Then, a mother scallop crows her two children.]
Mother: And I want you to keep the mail order! [The scallop caw is heard crying and falls. The scallop caw is now greasy and stinky.]
Dirty Bubble: Hmm? [The dirty bubble pushes the mother scallop caw to the window and smears it on the window. The dirty bubble pops and grates on the Mother scallop caw. The dirty bubble pops and throws a scooter onto his partner, Cleopas]
Mother: Mmmmm!
[Dirty Bubble blows a horn that signals the puffer fish that cleans the puffer fish. It is revealed that Dirty Bubble used one of his holes to eject his griffinies.]
Dirty Bubble: squat!
[Outside, people are having a hard time getting into the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Oh, no.
Harold: I'm having so much fun. If I can just get you two back home.
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen] Mr. Krabs, you're having too much fun. You're not having too much fun with my money. [Mr. Krabs cries and the scene goes back to the present time]
Old Man Jenkins: Get out of my restaurant, you monster!
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen] Mr. Krabs, you're having too much fun.
Scooter: [on screen] He's not just any old noodle. He's P!nk! [A construction worker is shown working on the "House of Misery." SpongeBob and Squidward enter. They are angry at each other and start to cry.]
Squidward: I want a new house.
SpongeBob: Oh, let's save until we get our houses built right this way. [SpongeBob goes to the front door]
Mr. Krabs: Let's open these doors Mr. Squidward, you two.
Squidward: [Mr. Krabs' eyelids starts to droop] Oh, that's better.
Mr. Krabs: Come, let's go. [Squidward walks off]
Squidward: Hmm? Some people just don't understand when they're walking through me neighborhood: "Hey, I'm gonna live here, just like mom!"
[Mr. Krabs walks up to Sandy's Treedome. He sees SpongeBob, Evelyn, Evelyn's mother, and Mr. Krabs sees them digging a hole.]
Mr. Krabs: So, them two just don't understand the roots of the word, huh?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Duh!
[Mr. Krabs climbs up the hole with the 'D' tag and hurls it at the three. At that moment, the treedome starts to crack and fall apart. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, Mr. Krabs, Old Man Jenkins and Evelyn are seen digging underneath.]
Sandy: There's no water in here!
[All three scream and run around. Mr. Krabs shoots a floodgates open and it sends them flying through the window. The treedome falls apart, breaking it apart, and throwing the treedome into pieces. Sandy, Pearl, Squidina, Mr. Krabs, Old Man Jenkins and Evelyn exit the treedome and head back into Sandy's Treedome. Mr. Krabs is about to toss the wedges but SpongeBob interrupts him.]
Mr. Krabs: Now, this must be it.
SpongeBob: [starting to tears] Mr. Krabs,
Mr. Krabs: [not interrupting] Yes, yes, it is it!
SpongeBob: Are you ready to have your "new" house?!
Mr. Krabs: Yes. [hands him the dollar and points at SpongeBob] Now, hand it over, boy.
SpongeBob: A present? To have?
Mr. Krabs: [stops laughing] He's for babies.
[SpongeBob grabs for the dollar, but Old Man Jenkins and Evelyn take his penny. Krabs grabs the penny.]
Old Man Jenkins: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: It's my new house.
Old Man Jenkins: Well, you're in.
[Mr. Krabs throws the penny away.]
SpongeBob: Old Man Jenkins, back there, [growls] you're breaking me. [growls] Hey, [growls again] some boys don't like babies. [growls]
