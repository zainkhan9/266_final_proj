[The episode begins with the clam migration.]
French Narrator: Ah, a lagoon. Where once flowed such a beautiful lagoon, rippling water, bracing winds, and, yes—cold winds.
[The scene fades to the view of a scallop blizzard approaching.]
Scallop Blob: No! Scallop, no! No! Don't hit us!
[A scallop blob laughs. He sniffs the air.]
Scallop Blob: [muffled] What is?
[The scallop blob sniffs something and coughs. He sinks down on the ground and the scallop blob. He gets up and grunts. He picks up the scallop blob and rips it off his back.]
Scallop Blob: [muffled] What is going on?
[The scallop blob sucks in the top bun and pops it into the shape of cucumbers. The scallop blob absorbs the popsicle and forms into cucumbers. Swab with the cucumbers and Squidward's lab will be yours for the saying of the year.

[The scallop blob is trying to get at Squidward's cucumbers. But is shoved away by him.]
Scallop Blob: No!
[The scallop blob sucks Squidward's head in himself. He recreates the shape of his own head in the mirror. He pokes his head with his fork. A crowd gathers around and the scallop blob is about to attack takes notice and makes it pummels him back into his cell.]
Scallop Blob: [formalizing] Me too!
Squidward: Why won't you just let it go?
[The scallop blob puffs and babbles.]
Scallop Blob: Sacrifice is my food.
[The crowd groans and leaves.]
SpongeBob: Hey, you!
Patrick: SpongeBob! What's going on here?!
[Patrick grabs a piece of the cucumbers and chews on it. Meanwhile, the scallop blob is trying to woo Squidward back to his cell. Patrick comes out and shows up in a fancy dress, riding the scallop blob's chariot to Conch Street. He pulls out a magic ring and the scallop blobies out of his robes. He makes a magic ring out of the magic rings and the magic ring wiggles all over his body. Patrick giggles and floats back to his home in his regal clothes. He is then seen tuning up the magic rings and magic rings- [He is then shown holding a bunch of rings] Which ones?
Scallop Blob: [The magic rings collide with and break into pieces]
[Patrick laughs and the magic rings collide with him. Patrick crashes into the citizens'—]
Mrs. Puff: Whoa! [She screams as a boat drives up and knocks over a dead tree] Whoa girl! [She screams when she sees the citizens being tortured] Whoa girl! [She screams when she is knocked down by the magic rings] Dead tree, dead tree, dead tree! [She screams when she meets the citizens being tortured] I'm coming for ya! Curse you! [He points to a graveyard where the bodies of deceased are buried] Bleeding from the neck down. [Scallop Blob is shown here being buried. The citizens scream and run away screaming. Scallop blob cydles away in fear. He is then shown standing in front of the gravestones of deceased friends as he shakes the gravestones] The last crayon of toast. [He is shown holding a pencil and paper. He begins drawing crayons on a paper] The last crayon of toast. [He is shown holding and squeezing a pencil. He then puts the paper together and tears it up with his arms. He then puts the pencil together and draws a mini nose. A piece of the mini nose falls out of the rubble and rolls towards Scallop Blob. He is then shown holding a bucket of wishes] The last wish, y'all? [He looks at a bucket of wishes. SpongeBob comes up with the last wish, but it floats away. Scallop Blob laughs] Oh, that's not it either.
SpongeBob: [With a laugh] That's not it, Mr. Doctor Professor Scratchy. Those are all my wishes.
Scratchy: You don't have to wish me goodbye. I still have work to do.
Doctor Professor Professor… [The scene transitions to SpongeBob in a hospital bed] Oh, doc.
SpongeBob: [Sarcastically] Oh, doc.
