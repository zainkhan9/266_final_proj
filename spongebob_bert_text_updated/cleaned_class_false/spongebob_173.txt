[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick walking to school.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. I'm so glad you're home.
Patrick: I hope you're not behind that sign again.
[SpongeBob is trying to give his thoughts on the sign to Patrick about to sign something.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Let's try to concentrate on the main subject of your essay. [looks at his watch] I have to get back to the Krusty Krab before it's too late. [notices the sign] Hello, I'm late for work. [falls through the floor into the kitchen sink] This may be the last sign you're trying to pronounce, but I am gonna make it last you long and hard. [as he comes up, he is in a full-body orthodrophobic shoe] Hi, Mr. WeirdLeafy. [pronounces it wrong] Your name. [he points at a piece of debris covering the word "LOL," causing SpongeBob to spit out a thumb balloon] That thumb balloon is the work of an understudy.
Patrick: Hmm... [takes a thumb balloon out of his shirt pocket] and spit in my mouth.
SpongeBob: Aww, we better put that back.
[They make another turn with the shoe, but they stopped at the curb. SpongeBob is walking with Patrick in his house, looking at the clock. Patrick is writing on some documents.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what'cha doing for the day,?
SpongeBob: Waiting for your order, Patrick.
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob: [leans to the floor and turns off the lamp] Looking good, buddy.
Patrick: [humming] Good, morning.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Gary.
Patrick: Gary, are you enjoying today's activity more than me?
SpongeBob: I suppose so, Patrick.
Patrick: Uhh, are you enjoying my activities more than me?
SpongeBob: [turns to face Gary] Meow.
[SpongeBob looks at the clock again. Patrick is sleeping. He turns the lamp off and goes to wake up, but fails.]
Patrick: SpongeBob! [grumbles in shock] What are you doing again, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: [wakes up] Huh? Oh, hi, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [forms a jump rope and gives a happy laugh] You're welcome, G-Man! [grabs Gary] You need a newfangled rope, is all. Now please walk with me. [walks off with Gary]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I got it! [starts to climb some stairs and makes a newfloor sponge by inverting the handle and knotting it with his thumbs. Gary climbs faster] Gary!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Looks like you need a newfangled rope, is all. Now please walk with me. [walks off with Gary]
Gary: Meow. [chuckles] 
SpongeBob: [in a trance] Sounds like fun. [walks off after a while, shutting the door, but stops as he sees Gary galloping] Good times. Now, Gary, this is a real treat. Looks like a lot of free-ass limousines to kick ass to people I've met [Gary starts to move, SpongeBob gasps] And look who's next, too. [Gary is rocking in. SpongeBob walks up to Patrick] Patrick, this is great. You and me doing all kinds of fun stuff, but where are you doing all this fun? [Patrick looks shocked] Are you crazy? You're on free-ass, you can', right?
Patrick: I am! [SpongeBob gasps] I am!
SpongeBob: Uh, where's your limo?
Patrick: Oh, I should know, buddy. [takes out his driver's license, then stamps it with his thumb] I'm applying for a free limousine.
SpongeBob: Oh, I can apply for a free limo, too, Patrick.
Patrick: I can! I just need a signature for my ride. [gives SpongeBob his license]
SpongeBob: Okay, buddy, I get it. [guides Patrick away] Now will you let me have my license, sir? [notices Patrick] Oh, my immortal soul! Patrick, you're a limo.
[SpongeBob and Patrick gallop by each other in terror. The officers gasp as they see the two thrill-searched citizens around the town.]
Officer: Patrick?
Patrick: Oh, hello, deputy.
