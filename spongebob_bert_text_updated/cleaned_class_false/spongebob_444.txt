SpongeBob: Then give me one. [Squidward gives it to him]
Patrick: Wow, another stupid idea! I love stupid ideas!
SpongeBob: Two stupid.
Squidward: Three stupid.
SpongeBob: Yeah... [chews up again and starts chewing on a paddle side]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoopee!
Squidward: [Gets lifted off] I just love to hate.
Patrick: Come with me... [SpongeBob and Patrick form a mob]
Howard: I hate to present you with such a nasty surprise, but...
Squidward: Yes, sir, sir, sir... [slams his keys on the tables] Listen, I just want to-
Howard: Let's take this as a yes, then follow me.
Squidward: How about this, huh? Follow me?
Howard: Now, where's my boat?
Squidward: Where's the motor?
Howard: Oh, my motor!
Squidward: Get a hold of yourself, Howard. Are you comfortable around Squidward?
Howard: No, Squidward is not comfortable around me. He is, in fact, so comfortable around me, that when I am not working, he shakes my hand and I am always watching out [holds out his hands for a second] and out [holds out his hands for a third] and out. And forget my motor! [walks out of his house and down the street] I am so ashamed. [sees SpongeBob walking with Tom]
Tom: Hi Squidward, this is SpongeBob!
Squidward: What? SpongeBob? I'm not wearing my motor!
Tom: That's my motor.
Squidward: Oh, no! That's my motor! I'm not hooking it up to any kind of... [flexes his butt] ...crank.
Tom: [reveals his butt] Oh, my stupid butt! Now, you don't know how uncomfortable my work-ho crabby body is to crabbingestones.
Squidward: Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah!
SpongeBob: Ah, ah, ah! [laughs but then capers out] Uh, Squidward, um, thank you for buying my work-ho crabby body a couple of times, right?
Squidward: No, that's not what I said!
SpongeBob: [leaves]
