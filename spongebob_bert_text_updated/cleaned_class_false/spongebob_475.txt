[Scene starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is cooking Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Ah, yes! The most delicious, briny Krabby Patty ever! May I take your order?
Squidward: Look! [holds up a menu] Looks. I've got the Krabby Patty formula. I want to eat it!
SpongeBob: Oh! What about the Krabby Patty formula? It's not that bad! Not quite as good as that one.
Mr. Krabs: Not quite as good as that one, eh? [laughs]
Squidward: Well, I did get... that formula.
SpongeBob: Oh! What about the Krabby Patty formula? It's not that bad! Not quite as good as that one, eh? [SpongeBob walks away chuckling]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know what you're talking about. I mean, uh...not quite as good as that one. [Later]
Squidward: [Whistles] Looks like he's got the formula.
SpongeBob: The Krabby Patty formula?!?
Squidward: Well, I don't know if he's... [SpongeBob notices the SpongeBob in the closet] I mean, [SpongeBob then walks up to Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patties?
SpongeBob: They're everywhere.
Mr. Krabs: I've never been to the Krusty Krab before- [close-up of SpongeBob's face] ...and I have no idea what that gas is or what it is or what it is.
SpongeBob: Wait a minute. What is it?
Mr. Krabs: It's a secret.
SpongeBob: A secret?
Mr. Krabs: A secret service.
SpongeBob: [showing Mr. Krabs' fin] A secret grand prix, here you are. I was to invite Mrs. Puff over for a quick bite.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob: I got a room here.
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And a room in the Krusty Krab that's a...real room, by the way, by the water.
Squidward: [Whispers to SpongeBob] Mrs. Puff, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but if you went in there, you'd have room for up to ten babies while I get to work. [SpongeBob gets to work, until his alarm clock goes off]
SpongeBob: Oh!
Mr. Krabs: Now all I need to do is keep it down! [SpongeBob's alarm clock keeps going off]
SpongeBob: [as he keeps walking] All I really need to do is keep it down!
Mr. Krabs: [starting to get tired] Are-ah, Are-ah!
SpongeBob: [smacks his claw against the light] Ow! My battery's dead.
Mr. Krabs: [shuddering] Babies?
SpongeBob: [stops walking and checks his watch] No, no, Mr. Krabs, I'm not the health inspector! [walks into the kitchen. He opens the can, then turns on the grill] Grilling the perfect... [gasps] What?
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... It's just a little grill on the side of the road.
SpongeBob: I wonder what it is, Mr. Krabs. We've been trying to tell them.
Mr. Krabs: Why don't you come with me, I'm not trusting the Krusty Krab to...
SpongeBob: Don't touch it. [Mr. Krabs picks it up] That's it. [Krabs puts it against the grill, and grabs SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm not sure if that's what it is.
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Mr. Krabs: It's a secret.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, don't you trust me?
Mr. Krabs: No, I never said that. [both hug] You're the best... I mean, the best driving fry cook in the world.
SpongeBob: Do you think, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs is a bit of a cross-eyed sack?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] No, I mean uh, yes I am, yes I am. But I'm more than willing to meet you with your own fishing rod. [laughs]
