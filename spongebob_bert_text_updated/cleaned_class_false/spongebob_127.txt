[The scene begins with a shot of the Krusty Krab with a fire going through the windows. The scene pans out to show the exterior of the restaurant. Squidward walks in the kitchen.]
Squidward: Good morning.
[The scene shows the front windows of the Krusty Krab with dollar signs painted on the inside. Karen comes out from cleaning the wallpaper. She looks in the register.]
Karen: We're sorry, customers.
[The scene shows Karen as she grumbles and enters the kitchen. The scene changes to show the front of the restaurant. Squidward walks up to Mr. Krabs while he is writing down his check. Mr. Krabs smells the patty.]
Mr. Krabs: I want that horrible work done properly. Not you sir. [Mr. Krabs sniffs the patty.] I want that patty cleaned personally. Not you sir. That and these orders, but...
[The scene shows Mr. Krabs' diary. It also shows a telescope that could see the Krabby Patty secret formula inside the patty. It also shows a robot hand that could make the patty come out to Squidward in real time. Mr. Krabs sighs.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, SpongeBob, you want it or leave it. [The scene shows SpongeBob walking to the door.] What say you? [The scene returns to the first sign of Mr. Krabs' door. The scene shows a long line of cars. The scene returns to the boatmunk in the kitchen.] What say we? [The scene returns to the grease boat that was part of the scene. It turns to the grease boat that was part of the scene. It turns to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.] What do we do now, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: We could go back in time and re-enact the Krabby Patty fight.
Mr. Krabs: Now, that would be a crime.
SpongeBob: Well, I'll re-enact it, Mr. Krabs.
[Mr. Krabs resumes his coffee mug. SpongeBob resumes walking.]
Mr. Krabs: That's the worst Krabby Patty gag I've ever heard.
[Mr. Krabs' alarm goes off. SpongeBob walks over to Mr. Krabs.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs. What are you doing?
[Mr. Krabs looks out from the window.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I thought you'd never ask. [Mr. Krabs grumbles] What do you want, boy?
SpongeBob: Well, these Krabby Patties are special.
Mr. Krabs: And ready to re-enact the Krabby Patty fight, right?
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah? [He starts to sweat] Irritating results. [He stops sweating. He stops sweating and turns around.] Very funny, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Yes, very funny. Very funny.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you want me to re-enact the Krabby Patty fight?
SpongeBob: Sure, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, re...
SpongeBob: Well, re... mean.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, nothing.
[SpongeBob resumes sweating.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: [While shaking his head] I don't know.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah. [He pushes SpongeBob.] Oh, no.
[Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob further.]
Mr. Krabs: Look, SpongeBob, we already told you, and you don't want me re-enacting it.
SpongeBob: But...
Mr. Krabs: You don't understand. It's not mean. It's mean-spirited.
SpongeBob: But I understand!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I understand, too. But then how are we going to re-enact the whole thing, when you're mean and hostile?
SpongeBob: [While pushing] I don't know! I wish we could go back and re-enact it.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know. It's not that time of the month. [He pushes Mr. Krabs.] Okay, SpongeBob, I do believe we could go back and re-enact the whole thing.
SpongeBob: [While pushing] I don't know. I have a better idea.
[Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob further.]
