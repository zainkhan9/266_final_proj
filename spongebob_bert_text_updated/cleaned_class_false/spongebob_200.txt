[The episode begins with an exterior shot of SpongeBob and Patrick's pineapple. Inside the pineapple, SpongeBob and Patrick are walking to work.]
Patrick: I thought I told you two to stay off my back.
[SpongeBob inhales through his platter and sighs. He sniffs his food and breath reveals nothing but air. He sighs and his eyes extend outward into his head.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick. Sounds like you and I are on to something.
Patrick: Sounds kind of suburban.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I'm just getting my psychological bearings.
[SpongeBob and Patrick feel their way to the doors and begin to feel the vibrations. Their gait has changed and they are now: nar't in the room, go out]
SpongeBob: Shh! Don't push the door.
Patrick: Oh, hey, SpongeBob. How are you doing out back?
SpongeBob: Well, I've got to work on my geometry. [his eyes have become flattened faces and his head expands]
[Patrick's head expands and his body shrinks. Both their shrunkens are cicadas. The excited SpongeBob goes to hide in the wall and goes to get Gary.]
SpongeBob: Gary the Snail, you are the snootiest, breath taking, amazing magician of the Snell. [SpongeBob takes Gary by the nose and pulls him in his cane] Say hello to Gary. [Gary caws and SpongeBob swallows. Later, we see the two inside the house]
House: And so, emotions rewind. 
[The scene changes to show the house in front of SpongeBob's and Patrick's eyes.]
SpongeBob: Io
Patrick: Inferno!
SpongeBob: Who knows what adventure awaits inside these architectural elements?
Patrick: Opening my eyes! [SpongeBob eyes open to say the opening. The scene changes to show the two inside SpongeBob's and Patrick's mouths.]
Both: [say the opening] Uh huhuh.
[The scene shows both inside SpongeBob's mouth and SpongeBob's mouth. SpongeBob has his back to the screen.]
SpongeBob: The other houses.
Patrick: I never knew the other one had a hot shower and took his water cup.
[The scene shows both in SpongeBob's mouth and SpongeBob's mouth.]
Both: Duh.
[The scene changes to show both inside Patrick's mouth and SpongeBob's mouth. Patrick has his head in his lap.]
SpongeBob: Ahh.
Patrick: And you like bubbles.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Let's go outside and seal the deal. [SpongeBob opens the door and Patrick moves his butt in circles around the window]
[The scene changes to show both inside and outside of SpongeBob's mouth. Patrick's butt is floating in the air. SpongeBob takes a bubble wand and floats in mid-air. He lands on Patrick's head.]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick, I think you should be ashamed of yourself. [Patrick starts to cry and SpongeBob has no choice but to tell him about the previous incident.] I just happened upon your hot tub, Patrick.
Patrick: Hot tub?!
[SpongeBob goes to the bathroom and finds it to be empty.]
SpongeBob: Oh, that. I must be dreaming. I think I got a bellyache.
[SpongeBob goes to get some toilet paper, but Patrick stops him.]
Patrick: No, SpongeBob! No, no, not that! [He takes the toilet paper and puts it on his head. SpongeBob gets some more.] Ow. Ooh. Ow!
[Patrick grabs the toilet paper and sticks it on SpongeBob's head. Both look up and see the ruler on the ruler the whole time. It is as big as SpongeBob's head.]
Patrick: [Gives the ruler to SpongeBob] Ooh. Ow. Ooh.
[SpongeBob gets angry and marks his ruler.]
SpongeBob: No, no, please! I'm a little busy right now.
Patrick: I see. [delighted] I see. [fills his head with water and puts it on the ruler] Ooh. Ooh.
[The scene changes to show the ruler. SpongeBob is writing on the ruler.]
SpongeBob: This is it! The ruler! The official star of Bikini Bottom is finally finished! And I can already hear myself thinking, "This is a great day for work! I am now royalty!" Huh?
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's head a blankly green and angry look. SpongeBob puts the ruler in his head piece of paper.]
