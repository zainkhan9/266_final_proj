<Start Ep> 
[episode starts with Gary doing a zig-zag while sprinkling water on the Gary-shaped patty. Then, we see Gary do a few trick moves]
SpongeBob: Go, Gary! Go, Gary! Go, Gary! [Squidward comes out of the shower] Squidward! Hi, Squidward. Happily showering. Happily showering. Heh, heh, heh. [Gary crawls out, startled] Oh, boy, what a filthy man! [smacks Gary]
Squidward: I can't find you. Please, I would like to speak to Mr. Wormsley. [gulps] I need a new coat of paint. [Gary meows]
Gary: [meows and stomps on the coat, then immediately barks and growls]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, but I think you've actually seen the coat. It's a little odd that you're so wide-eyed and all barks at the same time, but I must warn you, I'm going to rant for a while. [Gary notices] Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm not your friend. I don't like to barge into people's lives, frankly.
Gary: [meowing and getting stommed out]
SpongeBob: Oh, that is bad! Not bad! Not bad! Bad! Boring! Boring! Now, do you mind if I ask him a few questions about his private jet?
Squidward: I was hoping I could get you to hand over the full arsenal of magical superweapons you've got, but I'm afraid I'mn't going there. [grumbles and Gary meeps in shock]
SpongeBob: Look, I agree that you should give him what he needs, but Gary, I don't want to have to answer his every whim.
[cut to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Hands off, Squidward! That's the budget!
Squidward: For the love of yah!
Mr. Krabs: Well, okay! I accept your challenge.
SpongeBob: Hooray!
Squidward: [whispering to Gary] Yay!
[Cut to the Chum Bucket, with Plankton nearby]
Plankton: Hi, Gary. Are you ready to give up your secret formula and join the Krusty Krab?
Gary: [whispering] Meow.
Plankton: Great! Let's just go shopping. [closes Chum Bucket. After shopping, he opens the doors for Gary and Squidward]
Squidward: Good evening, and welcome to the Krusty Krab!
Plankton: I'm ready! [closes Chum Bucket. After shopping, he closes the doors for Gary and Squidward]
Squidward: Ooh, patties are made in secret. If you don't come to the meeting, I'll have my head stuck in the machine!
Plankton: It doesn't work that way. [licks lips]
Squidward: Actually, [licks lips] I like patties made in secret.
Plankton: You do?
Squidward: Oh, yes I do.
Plankton: It's what secret it is, you monster!
Squidward: Well, get to work!
[Cut to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: SpongeBob! [gasps] Not that SpongeBob! That wonderful pink eel that every little moron needs to get his free Krabby Patty! This is my public employee! He's providing the public with a taste of his secret abilities. If I were any older I'd be using this for my own good! [holds up clipboard] With Squidward's permission. [holds up deed to SpongeBob] Here's the address I used.
[cuts to Patrick at the register]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, have you seen my secret formula?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not again, Patrick.
Patrick: I think it's cold out. [flicks formula over to Squidward]
Squidward: Huh? What do you mean it's not cold? It's okay! [pushes SpongeBob away] They're just keeping the safe-deposit box.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not a safe-deposit box, Patrick. It's a bunching box that gives away your secret formula.
Patrick: Secret? I don't understand. You keep everything you need? Maybe you should buy more!
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, I think we have to get rid of that box!
Patrick: Well, how about more?!
