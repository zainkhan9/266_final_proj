[opens up a new window that shows Squidward reading a comic book while eating marshmallows]
SpongeBob: [touches the marshmallow with his tongue] Hi, Squidward. How...AHHH! [Squidward stutters] Hey, how come when you press the crunching nuts of your hands, you squeeze in the magic comic book? [Squidward yelps] Conklin' crunching nuts...[screams and runs away] Hey, gimme, yum! [Squidward runs away as two marshmallows crunch and fly into his mouth] What the...? Why, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! Why, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! Why, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! Why, gimme, gimme, gimme! [thinking, he squeezes in and sees a pop-up picture of Squidward]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Look at that, an artist! An artist I admire! And this is it! The icing on the cake! And here it is, icing on the cake! And I'm gonna love it! So many comic books! So many artist friends! [thinking] Hey, gimme, gimme, gimme! Comic books are the best! Oh, gimme, gimme! [thinking and flailing his arms back to normal] Gimme, gimme, gimme! Comic books are the best! Oh, gimme, gimme!
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That guy's the best is... [talking to himself] ...imagination. [talking to himself] Imagination. [talking to himself]
Squidward: I hate to say it, but he's the best. I wish he was.
SpongeBob: He is the best?
Squidward: You're kidding. You want him to be the best?
SpongeBob: If he were the best, we'd be superheroes!
Squidward: Yeah!
SpongeBob: Let's do this!
[SpongeBob and Patrick run away from the cheering crowd. Butterflies fly in the air. SpongeBob and Patrick fly like a balloon, flying over to where the superheroes are still in the air. Butterflies fly around the superheroes. SpongeBob and Patrick stand straight like balloons. SpongeBob stands straight, but when he stands up, he's floating.]
Patrick: You can't stand it anymore!
[Patrick jumps into a boot. SpongeBob and Patrick stand straight like balloons. But when they're facing each other, they're looking at the wrong direction. So, they fly over to hit each other. Then, they stand in front of a crowded restaurant.]
Tina: Here's your hot pizza.
[SpongeBob and Patrick stand in front of a crowded restaurant.]
Patrick: Here's your cold pizza.
[SpongeBob and Patrick stand in front of a crowded restaurant.]
Sandals: [cheering] Welcome to The Krusty Krab. My friends from the front lines... [speaking gibberish] are always on our minds.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are standing in front of the crowded restaurant. Squidward is about to eat a Krabby Patty, but stops notice an ice cube perched on the edge of the plate. He moves his desk to the edge and slides the ice cube away. SpongeBob and Patrick are still standing there] And that's how I got rid of the idea that Squidward has a chocolate allergy.
SpongeBob: Mm, that's very defamatory!
[Squidward looks to his right, and goes to eat the ice cube. But as he enters, all of the customers move to the front lines, and begin a riot, chanting for SpongeBob and Patrick to stop eating ice cream and to stop eating Squidward. The riot ends. The Ice Cream King sits inside his cart, mumbling]
Mr. Krabs: Hee, hee, hee. It's time for the Krusty Krab ice cream countdown.
Squidward: Ha. Ha! All the greatest heroes from the Krusty Krab are here! One, two, three. [his face doubles as his head rises up and he screams]
[His face returns to normal. He measures himself with a mallet and reads the sign.]
Squidward: Ha, ha, ha! The greatest Krusty Krab fan in the whole town!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, we can't have that senior citizen. He's too important.
