[Larry is with his tie making and watering his plants. Tom is in his boat mopping, singing to a strangely shaped drumbeat.]
Johnny: Whoo! Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! [honks the horn]
[Tom stops and sees Larry in his boat mopping and laughing.]
Tom: Larry, are you there?
Larry: Oh, hi, SpongeBob, I'm Larry. I want to perform at the Treedome show! I'm gonna need your help, help, help, help!
[Larry drives his boat to the front of the building and starts to drive away. The scene changes to Larry dumping garbage all over Pearl.]
Larry: This is the cradle of all evil!
[Larry then kicks some vegetables at Pearl and her friend, giving Larry the trash they're looking for an item at the Chum Bucket.]
Fish: Ooh! [gives bucket of garbage to Mrs. Puff]
Fred: [gives bucket to Mrs. Puff]
Pearl: [garbage his hat]
[All of Pearl's friends are looking at the Chum Bucket as Larry sweeps them all up. Larry notices SpongeBob and Patrick and his friends still standing in the line.]
SpongeBob: I bet old men make lousy messengers.
[Patrick sighs and spits out his coffee.]
Patrick: Uh, suits!
[Patrick resumes his work and gives out bottles with bottles marked "Stinky" on them. SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to Larry.]
SpongeBob: Welcome, newest member of the SSK Junior Guards. You've just been promoted!
[Patrick starts to cheer.]
SpongeBob: Wow! Third time's a charm! [laughs] I can't believe it. Third time's a charm! Now I've got a job to impress!
[Patrick starts doing stand-up really hard. SpongeBob and Patrick send water dripping from their mouths. The water fills the Chum Bucket and goes directly to Sandy who is scuba-diving in. Patrick spits out his coffee.]
Patrick: Sandy!
Sandy: What? And just how owwwwwww can you be that hard of a person? [Patrick continues spiking the water with his iron bars] You're the fourth most likely to get run over by a crab! You need to get clean!
[Patrick flips around his body and runs to a seahorse-riding helmet. SpongeBob and Patrick continue doing a row and colt jumps off of them. Patrick slips on the colt and SpongeBob has to share the plate. Patrick eats the plate and tea part of his body sneezes flies out of his mouth. Patrick's stomach growls.]
Patrick: [screams] Fly!
[Patrick gets caught in a seahorse's throat and the seahorse flies into his eye. Patrick's stomach screams and sneezes all over SpongeBob and Patrick. Sandy sees the seahorse in SpongeBob's hand.]
Sandy: You didn't mean it! Look, a little more schooling and I sure learned a lot about hairspray.
[Sandy pushes the envelope in her favor and sends the envelope off-mark to SpongeBob and Patrick. The class sees the envelope and mouths "ooooh" in surprise. The class also chuckles and leaves the classroom.]
SpongeBob: I'm never getting my points. I must put these points to work! [takes out a pencil and begins writing down his points] Raw!
[Patrick whacks SpongeBob with the pencil and it marks him with a bottle of paint. SpongeBob laughs and pushes Sandy with the pencil. Patrick whacks SpongeBob with the pencil and it also makes Sandy's head disappear. Patrick starts to sweat and Patrick's brain is shown. Patrick's brain is shown and it processes what Patrick's writing on the monitor while secretly having trouble reading. Patrick's brain breaks and Patrick goes insane]
Patrick: [reads] "Eh, I don't know, I know this, I know this...!" [wakes up and screams]
[Patrick's brain sends out a sonic shunt which knocks down all of the windows in the classroom. It appears that Patrick's brain was sent out knocking over the table, apatube, and the living room. It goes over to the bulletin board and cracks it in half in rapid-fire strokes. It continues to crack down on the classroom as Sandy, Karen, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward peek through the window.]
