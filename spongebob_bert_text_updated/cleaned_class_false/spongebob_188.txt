[Plankton is shadowing Squidward with his doublings] 
[Episode starts when Mr. Krabs appears on TV, with sunglasses on, and speaking into one of Squidward's arms.]
Mr. Krabs: [Off-screen] I hereby present to you... the Krusty Krab. [Mr. Krabs and Squidward sit on a long table and see a table full of Krabby Patties. Mr. Krabs imagines a pirate eating a patty.] Let's see what he gets... [A patty is thrown at Mr. Krabs' eyestalks] A pirate!
Squidward: Don't touch it! [Throws away the patty] Don't touch it!
Mr. Krabs: Don't touch it! [Throws away the patty] Don't touch it! [Cut to a Krabby Patty on a conveyor belt in the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: It's too sweet. I'll never make it back to work this time. [Puts the patty in the machine and drives out of the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Woo-hoo! I'm sorry, boy, but you're gonna have to go back to your family and friends in the streets. That'll be tough for them.
SpongeBob: Maybe we shouldn't stick together.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah! [They laugh] 
Squidward: [angry] Go, SpongeBob! [cheers as he walks off] You're fired. [stops and gets himself kicked in the foot. He groans at the two.] Go back to work! Get a job! Like a job!
[cuts to Mr. Krabs and Squidward in the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [gets a tray with a Krabby Patty on it] Here's your fries.
Squidward: [gets turned on and angry] I'll never make it back here fed up with your stench! [Bashes the tray against the wall and all the customers get sprayed. SpongeBob sprays his face in it.]
Mr. Krabs: [Angry] I ain't poor yellow. [Screams in retaliation.] 
[cuts to the Krusty Krab kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: [reads a menu] Here's the Krabby Patty... [reads back menu with a menu] ...with lettuce and tomato. [reads back menu with his nose holes slapped in it.] Hmmm... you know the husband... [his eyes are turned away and he runs out of the Krusty Krab] 
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you crazy? We have so many things in common, he'll probably steal every one from you and steal a whole line of our food! [laughs] 
Mr. Krabs: Hey, let's not get anything out of our restaurants of our customers. [Mr. Krabs runs over there and clings onto a table] He's going to the window! [Mr. Krabs jumps out the window and starts smashing windows. The customers are starting to worry about Mr. Krabs.] Is it any wonder he's so popular? 
Nat: He'll steal all our food! [Mr. Krabs gets on the table and is going to the window. But SpongeBob breaks through the window and lands on the food.] 
SpongeBob: [Crashes into the window while Mr. Krabs is on the window] Ha, ouch! That was the most beautiful moment of my young life! 
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about, SpongeBob?! 
SpongeBob: [stammers] Ha, ha, ha, ha. Don't you mean mean? 
Mr. Krabs: [cut to him and SpongeBob walking down the street] I hate to precipitate on your dopey young Mr. Krabs, but we have to be careful. We don't want to cause any loss of business, alright. 
SpongeBob: Oh, good. Thanks for giving me a nice line in the street. 
Mr. Krabs: [screams] He's out of me way! Don't worry, I'll get him. [cuts to Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob hiding behind a coral rock. Inside SpongeBob's house, Mr. Krabs has left in his own house. The octopus is back in his aquarium, happy. Well, both sad and amused]
