[The episode launches with SpongeBob and Patrick outside the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. Let's go down to the back room and find Sandy.
[Patrick skids all the way down to the front room with the disguise he made earlier.]
Patrick: What's wrong, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It's not that bad.
Patrick: It's just that...
SpongeBob: Oh! Why don't we just take a look around the back room?
[SpongeBob looks around the back room where Sandy is sleeping on his chair. He walks to the table, where Sandy is about to eat a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Okay. Just take the doubloons.
Patrick: I don't do it...
SpongeBob: Hey, you do.
Patrick: I'm not doing it...
SpongeBob: Hey, don't wake up, buddy! I'm not... [Patrick starts up a car and drives off with it] I'm not... [Patrick starts up a boat again] sleeping on Patrick's chair! [SpongeBob jumps in the boat and tries to turn the lights on. However, the propellers keep spinning and the scene goes black. SpongeBob swerves the boat, knocking over several Krabby Patties. He crashes the boat into Sandy's, who is about to eat one.]
SpongeBob: Huh? Uh, sorry, Gary. I'm just gonna go sit on my chair and take a little nap. [SpongeBob goes to put the chair on and Sandy's stomach wakes up. She wakes up, but is surprised at what just happened. She starts to rattle and shrieks, calling out for help. SpongeBob jumps out of the boat and grabs the toothbrushbrush, which was in SpongeBob's hand.] Shh, shh, shh. Gotta get rid of that dirt!
Gary: Meow, meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary, I'm not trying to be a jerk. I'm just being a little aggressive. [He rips off his pants and jumps onto Sandy, who is about to eat the patty]
Sandy: No, no, come back! [SpongeBob takes a bite of the patty and cackles] I love dogs!
SpongeBob: [tears up cereal] Hmmm, okay. [Picks up a box with the words "This" on it. He then notices a sombrero in it.]
Patrick: Oh! [Rings the bell] Take this here!
SpongeBob: [Rides the bike rack up to the front doors] Hey, Patrick, what's happening?
Patrick: [He thinks] It's Sandy. She's going down!
Both: [They run to the elevator] Mom, look out!
Ms. Priss: You're both on your way. [Goes back to the scene] Bravo!
SpongeBob: Ms. Priss?
Ms. Priss: I'm Priss. [Holds up her camera] I hope you're not boring her, SpongeBob. I've got a special job to get her into. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob in the kitchen, reading a newspaper.]
SpongeBob: And I need your help, help with... help with... nails.
Ms. Priss: And that's why I'm calling today.
SpongeBob: And that's why I'm here today. Drive.
Ms. Priss: And that's why you're here today.
SpongeBob: Well, let me get my nails started right there. [Holds up two coats of polish] Perfect.
Ms. Priss: [Takes one and puts it on his forehead] I'll polish them up later.
SpongeBob: [Holds up more coats of polish] Wow!
Ms. Priss: [Takes another one and puts it on his forehead] I want you to- [Holds up more nitrates] Now you try. [Holds up two other coats of polish] I know you've noticed my new job. Don't worry, I'll get them out of your hands.
SpongeBob: Wow, reflex. You're applying over-the-counter medication.
Ms. Priss: Antidepressant medication?
SpongeBob: No, that's another thing I am doing.
Ms. Priss: Oh, that's a funny one, SpongeBob. Do you think there's a solution to your acting-askan moods?
SpongeBob: Psst, psst, psst.
Ms. Priss: I don't care. Who wants to help them?
