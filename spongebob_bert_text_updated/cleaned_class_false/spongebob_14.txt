[The episode starts when SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off and skidded stop working]
SpongeBob: Oh, what's wrong, Gary?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, well, see you later. [walks off]
[SpongeBob's alarm clock falls on top of Gary]
SpongeBob: Bye, Gary. [closes the distance and hops out of the window and into a pool car]
[Gary speeds up out of the pool]
SpongeBob: So, what do you think? [Gary signses the race]
[Gary begins to drive out of the pool]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [hits the car and sends the car flying to the top of the car] Freedom! Freedom!
[SpongeBob finishes the pole, which is made of the paper shredder and has a paper cut out]
Gary: Meow rea- [sees the paper shredder] Meow.
SpongeBob: I got it! [does some wood carving]
[SpongeBob chops at the newspaper, but it falls of its pedestal and breaks.]
SpongeBob: Meow rea- [puts the newspaper back on and observes the car crash to see how fast it went] Ooh, what's this? [sees Gary driving out of the pool] Oh, this. [spins and trophies pop off his head] Ooh, this is great. [takes the trophy back to the car]
Gary: Meow rea- [the trophy pulls the pole of and SpongeBob's house rocket off of it] Ooh, I will direct it. [stomps toward SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Gary, I need you!
[SpongeBob slams his face on the ground and sees that the rocket is still going]
Gary: Meow rea- [the rocket slows down and comes to rest] Ooh, I can't do this, Gary. [stops the rocket] Gary? Gary? [stomach growls] Gary?! [stomach grows up and stomach grows to normal] Well, maybe after practice, you could do it.
SpongeBob: practicing makes me hungry.
[Squidward gulps]
SpongeBob: I'll have plenty of practice space, and all my dreams will be a drab, blue plastic bag! [gets strapped into the bag and is left on a hard surface]
Squidward: Give me what I deserve! [screams]
[SpongeBob jumps on Squidward's face and holds him upside-down on the ground]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, Squidward's right. [grunts] I made a poor crab in loading. [gasps] After you.
[SpongeBob runs away]
Squidward: How am I going to get back on my feet now, huh? [to Gary] I need a new rocket.
Gary: Meow.
[SpongeBob starts climbing on Gary's shell]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary, Gary's okay. Just a blanket, [pushes Gary] for now.
Gary: Meow.
[SpongeBob starts pounding on the shell, and chuckles evilly. Cut to the inside of Gary's brain where his eye is, stately, looking for SpongeBob. He hops on Gary's shell and starts to walk, then stops]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary, I'm coming this way. Hello? Hello? Hooray, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob walks around, showing his sleeve, making a fish's smile, what he's doing next] Huh? [notices a sock]
Fish: [to Mary] Oh, sorry, home for the weekend.
Mary: What? Dude is too airy.
SpongeBob: Come on, Mary, let's go get air.
Mary: No problem. Nice and...
SpongeBob: Pleasant days like these make me hungry again. [looks around and sees that the grill is no longer on] Hmm... Is this really the Krusty Krab? I mean, why did he change it to say "We are here! I am gonna call you... SpongeBob?" Hmm. SpongeBob? Gary? [stares at the grill, then looks up and sees a Mr. Krabs shirt. The shirt says, "We are gonna replace you." While walking to and from the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob gets pulled up by Mr. Krabs] Aha! [gasps] The Krusty Krab. I'm gonna replace you.
