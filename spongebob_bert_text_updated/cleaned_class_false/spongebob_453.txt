Patrick: That looks like fun.
SpongeBob: What are you talking about, Patrick?
Patrick: Don't you belong here? You just stepped on a lifeguard tower.
SpongeBob: I don't belong here!
Patrick: Oh look, you don't belong here either! You're not supposed to talk to people!
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick. I think my right to talk about what I do is under attack.
