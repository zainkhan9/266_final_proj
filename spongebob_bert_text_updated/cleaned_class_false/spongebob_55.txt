Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob. You seem to be back.
SpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick, I feel great.
Patrick: You, too.
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know if I'm feeling very well or just a little bit concerned.
Patrick: I am concerned. [looks at Patrick's rock]
SpongeBob: But why is that?
Patrick: Well, I think that's probably because your arm... [puts a band on his hand]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's fantastic! Thanks, Patrick. [walks off]
Patrick: What's wrong, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Your friend said he's going to see Larry in his... [looks at Patrick's rock]
Patrick: Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob: Patrick! Is Larry looking?!
Larry: No, Mr. Squidward! Larry is always right down!
Squidward: [chortles] Well, maybe he's just this week gets harder and the more times, the more I'm creepier and creepier!
Larry: Hey, what's wrong, Squidward?
Squidward: I don't know what you're talking about! [cries] The Krusty Krab is chock-full of chumps!
Larry: Hey, I know it's not just a rock but a large, carnivorous beast! That would explain why it soaks up so often!
SpongeBob: Well, you wouldn't know what a carnivorous beast Larry is, because you never know... [sees something] Hey, what the...?!
Larry: I saw it! I saw it!
SpongeBob: Larry the: The what?
Larry: A stick of dynamite! I'm getting mine.
SpongeBob: You're right, Larry! [goes up to Larry] Larry, help! Mr. Krabs is coming out of town! Help me!
Larry: And I'm— [Larry gets up and runs off] Larry! Mr. Krabs will be back soon. Thanks, doc.
SpongeBob: [worried] Larry, isn't Larry the best thing that could happen?
Larry: I say he should be the chef of the highest order, sir.
SpongeBob: But isn't he the champion of the highest order?
Larry: Well, let me give you an example. [hands SpongeBob a hat] The most important dish of the day—a hat made of stinky ice cream—is Larry's curd.
SpongeBob: Larry's curd?
Larry: Larry's curd? It doesn't matter to me who owns the ice cream—it doesn't matter to me who owns the ice cream—it doesn't matter who owns the ice cream— it doesn't matter who owns the ice cream— it doesn't matter who owns the ice cream— it doesn't matter who owns the ice cream— it doesn't matter who owns the ice cream— it doesn't matter!
[Scene cuts to the back of the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob stands outside]
SpongeBob: You can't be mad at me for having the smallest dick in the sea?
Larry: Hey, a little help here.
SpongeBob: All right, yeah, all right. Larry the Lobster is the head chef of the highest order. He's the one who owns and operates the ice cream shop and—
Larry: Who owns and operates the ice cream shop?! [chortles]
Larry: [looks at SpongeBob] SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that your boss Monica got you in trouble, but we should probably talk about our business before we bring in a newbie [turns to a TV]
SpongeBob: Oh, Hey, what's this? Wow, now I got my own TV. How'd Monica get such a fine spot for you?
Larry: She got you this time?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Larry: Monica? Monica? [the TV turns off, SpongeBob turns to television]
SpongeBob: Bye, beloved boss Monica. Have a good day, okay? [chuckles] Okay. [chuckles] Good day, general.
Larry: [chortles] SpongeBob, I'm not really feeling any better. [gets back up] I'm not really feeling any better?! [sobs] Why is this all the more reason to bring in a newbie?
SpongeBob: Oh, I mean, just look at this. It's almost like an aftershock!
Larry: Me, too! It's almost like an aftershock!
