[Episode starts at the Krusty Krab where Squidward is talking at the register.]
Squidward: [muffled] How... How are you...? [Mr. Krabs opens the door to speak more rapidly] Why, it's just yesterday I was cooking Krabby Patties. And it's not even noon. You can eat now. [walks out of the kitchen, then Squidward curves around and around as he talks] We've been here awhile. This is the only place in the world people are cooking.
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Squidward, I'm trying to follow my lunch...
Squidward: To follow my lunch? What are you doing!?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's alright, Squidward, Mr. Krabs' recipe is the best!
Mr. Krabs: It's the best!? And it's the best!?
Squidward: And he's written it all down!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't know what you two missed out, but that recipe is the law.
[Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab where a delivery truck backs up. SpongeBob gasps]
SpongeBob: Delivery! [to Squidward] I've got your recipe, sir.
Squidward: Great, but I haven't even had my first delivery.
SpongeBob: Well, I must say you have been one of my favorite customers. I think that's telling.
Squidward: And you said that you were gonna write a book on delivering.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. Maybe a little too much about it. [laughs] Don't worry, Squidward. I'll find you a delivery rod that's as safe and sweet as possible.
Squidward: I'm not sure how I'm feeling after hearing what you wrote about me.
SpongeBob: Let's hear it, then.
Squidward: You?
SpongeBob: Well, I wrote a bunch of stuff. [he and Squidward read the notes together.]
Squidward: You remember?
SpongeBob: Yes. The whole thing was a romp through my head. [laughs]
Squidward: You're not finished yet, are you?
SpongeBob: As soon as I get my hands on that formula. [closes the paper]
Squidward: So, what do you say, Mr. Kelpy?
Mr. Krabs: I'd love it if you'd come down to our first thing in the morning. [Squidward knocks on door and SpongeBob answers]
Squidward: Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, we can have the formula at the show.
Squidward: That's it?
SpongeBob: Yeah. The whole thing is a romp through my head. I love the sounds of it.
Squidward: That's it?
SpongeBob: Yeah. The whole thing is a romp through your head. Every bit the world, in its entirety, and in its entirety. [Squidward knocks on SpongeBob's door]
Squidward: Can I have the formula?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. [takes off his hat]
Squidward: [opens his door] Oh, you won't believe what I have been up to this morning! Uh-uh... eating and sleeping. I call it karaa... [clears throat] karate.
SpongeBob: [in a karate voice] This is not just a little talk. This is my whole day.
Squidward: Actually, this is my day today. [voice gets higher and higher]
SpongeBob: [voice gets higher and higher] What is it? What are you doing?
Squidward: I'm writing this for a very important day of the week: the day that every man, woman, child, and fortune-teller in the world will be th... [voice gets higher and higher] ...th... [Squidward whispers in his ear] Squidward. [normal voice becomes loud] Uh, what is it?
Squidward: You can't deprive someone of his good fortune just because he takes a little trip to the Himalayas. [SpongeBob steps off and shows Squidward the trip]
SpongeBob: It's not a trip to the Himalayas. [Squidward whispers in his ear. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Yes, officer?
Mr. Krabs: I would like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward. He is the owner of a very successful business.
