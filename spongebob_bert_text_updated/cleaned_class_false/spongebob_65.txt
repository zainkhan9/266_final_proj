[Episode begins at Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob is riding his bike on the side of the road, looking at various colorful fish, then he snaps his fingers.]
SpongeBob: [snaps his fingers] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uhh, Squidward?
Squidward: Yeah? [grunts as he pulls his tongue out] SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward! Look at what I've done!
Squidward: [runs into SpongeBob] Please don't eat my tail!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, please don't eat my tail!
Squidward: Uhh, you, you followed me around, right?
SpongeBob: That's right. I followed you.
Squidward: Is that true?
SpongeBob: Yes, it is.
Squidward: Then how do you explain this rotating door?
SpongeBob: It's a door with shelves.
Squidward: Ooh, I wonder what else you could use that is [turns around] circular?
SpongeBob: [laughs] A little lounge. [Squidward laughs] Or this window.
Squidward: [groans] I don't know! That's disgusting. [walks to the kitchen]
SpongeBob: It's really not that bad ices!
Patrick: SpongeBob, when we went to sleep, did you know you were sleeping as well?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Oh, how do I know? I just laughed, and [throws pillow and blanket over himself] I'll just sleep in peace. [turns around and goes to opposite side]
Squidward: Uhh, where are we going? [turns around] Hmm, where are we going? [slams door. Later, the Bikini Bottom Choir plays its part in this episode by having Squidward stand on its feet and sing the theme song backwards. The same tune is played backwards into the Chum Bucket. Squidward is then playing the same part over and over again. He is now taller and gives a very insulting thumbs up. Later, SpongeBob walks in on stage and is wearing a T-shirt that says, "I Am Squidward" and holding a giant fork. He turns around and is very high-set.]
SpongeBob: Time for bed, Squidward.
Squidward: Not now, SpongeBob. Can't go anywhere while I clean out this bedroom and my other naughty records. [as he is walking out of the Krusty Krab, he cracks his eyes in disgust] They put them away the day I was born. [laughing. Later, SpongeBob is standing next to the Krusty Krab sign.] And when I was a baby, Mr. Krabs wanted me to be his new fry cook.
[SpongeBob gasps in horror when he sees Mr. Krabs putting his baby teeth on the register. SpongeBob looks at his watch and his alarm goes off]
SpongeBob: [leans closer to Mr. Krabs] Oh, baby, there's no time to waste.
Mr. Krabs: Baby, come in! Please! Come in, Mama.
Mama: I'll be in the kitchen for a little baby.
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, Mama. I'll be right here if you need me. [goes into the kitchen, shuts the door, and goes back into the register]
Mama: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Just cleaning up the messes. [gets a bucket, and goes in]
Mama: I couldn't care less than to bring you a precious record to keep.
SpongeBob: Great! And what's your problem starts to get worse!
Mama: We were playing clarinet and I cut the cord.
SpongeBob: Did you cut it?
Mama: Of course you did. It's why I keep my clarinet playing.
SpongeBob: Well, what about my Mama record?
Mama: I mean, you're the one who cut the cord, right?
SpongeBob: Mama, Mama, Mama.
Mama: Yup.
SpongeBob: Well, I don't have to tell you this name and you won't have to tell me you've got a problem. Okay, okay. [giggles] Okay. Good night.
Mama: [answ. to man] Good night.
[SpongeBob turns the switch and he's sleeping on the ground. The next scene shows him on a coral tree with trees all round him. He hears a knock on the door. He opens it]
