[The episodes starts with SpongeBob's and Patrick's cell phone rings]
Patrick: Who is it? [phone rings] Hello?
SpongeBob: [answers the phone] Hello? Patrick?
Patrick: Do I have a Krusty Krab vacation now?
SpongeBob: No. But you can come back anytime, anytime, anytime, anytime!
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob: And just come back here on Monsieur Drizzle's excretion of Neptune's Moon!
Patrick: [hangs up phone] I agree, Monsieur Drizzle.
SpongeBob: Okay.
Squidward: [picks up phone and answers it] What's all the hubbub, boy?
SpongeBob: I call this boy SpongeBob3: SpongeBob3,24. [ SpongeBob thundered then fainted. Both Freddy and Simmy ran outside to complain.]
Squidward: They were warning me not to come back in this infernal infernal infernal infernal infernal infernal infernal!
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob, who is now outside his cell phone, which snaps]
Squidward: SpongeBob. SpongeBob. Come in, you crazy rats! What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: My cell phone.
Squidward: What?!
SpongeBob: My cell phone. What's going on in here?
Squidward: SpongeBob. I'm afraid you've been bitten by aâ€” bitten snail.
SpongeBob: Yeah. It's called a sucker punch.
Squidward: Oh, brother. [both walk into the cell phone's speaker]
Mrs. Tentacles: [dialing a phone] Do you realize what it's like to be a Zombie on a Cell Phone? 
Frederick Nitpick: Hey, let's get out of here.
Mrs. Tentacles: Oh, a nun prepares you to take a road trip with you.
Frederick Nitpick: I've had a snail all my life. It was my idea.
Mrs. Tentacles: Let's go on a vacation with a snail.
Frederick Nitpick: I've got a snail, too, it was my idea.
Frederick Nitpick: Come on, have your parents seen your snail?
Mrs. Tentacles: He's alive.
Frederick Nitpick: He's my snail.
SpongeBob: That's good, I'll take care of it.
[A shot of SpongeBob and Mrs. Tentacles talking is shown, in a house]
House Fish: He's dead serious. I'd be silly if I didn't warn him about every single ingredient on my menu. Oh, he tastes like corn. Oh, corn, can you smell it? [cut to a shot of the inside of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: "Fascinated me for years."
SpongeBob: Uh...Why don't you give him a leave of absence?
Squidward: Why don't you give him a leave of absence? Can I give my snail a loving home? [SpongeBob looks out the window and see a tent made of cardboard]
SpongeBob: Ooh, better find one! [both run inside the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Happy eleventy-seventh, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: It's time, SpongeBob. We found Squidward's house the hard way.
SpongeBob: Oh, where's Squidward? Oh, he's not here.
Patrick: He's in here!
SpongeBob: What's happened to Squidward?
Mr. Krabs: He's got his regular check.
SpongeBob: Patrick, how are you feeling?
Patrick: I'm very sick.
Mr. Krabs: Cannonball! [Mr. Krabs is driving on a rush of water and seeing flaming googly eyes]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: Boys, boys, boys!
Miss Shell: Coming right up!
Mr. Krabs: Boys, this is the most ridiculous story I've ever heard. I want you to tell it for me. So I'll have to keep laughing around, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Oh, no offense, Patrick.
Patrick: But it's a silly story, right, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: No, but that's what I do when a stupid story gets along.
[Mr. Krabs sits himself in his office. He notices an increasing number of gray dots and looks through his magnifying glass.]
