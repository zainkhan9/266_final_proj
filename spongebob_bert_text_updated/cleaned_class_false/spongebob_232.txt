[At SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob and Patrick are cleaning the windows with the floor toy.]
SpongeBob: Cleaning! Cleaning!
Patrick: I'm coming over for a little recital.
[SpongeBob and Patrick go into their play rooms. SpongeBob puts on his head-sculpture house mirror, and Patrick puts on his house costume.]
SpongeBob: One mirror blast, please.
[SpongeBob and Patrick lift their heads up and dance to the music.]
Patrick: Let's get this party started.
SpongeBob: I'm on the move.
Patrick: Let's throw rocks.
[SpongeBob stomps away in panic, and falls next to Patrick in the rock fight.]
Patrick: Hooligans!
SpongeBob: You're it! [stomps on Patrick's head and squirts water at his face] Hey, Patrick, I got an idea!
[Patrick's head falls out of his costume. SpongeBob and Patrick sigh in relief. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick at the carnival.]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, in our turn people will be here for the carnival.
Patrick: Oh, yeah. The first round of voting will be tonight.
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter the ball pit.]
SpongeBob: Hey, what started out as a fun day is now a lot like starting a business! We can introduce you to some of the great people today.
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: You know Slimphu's got a line.
Patrick: Be workin' here today.
[SpongeBob walks to the front doors of several places work in the amusement park.]
Lime and snow are on the walls. Snow floes are falling. The whistle is playing.
Patrick: Be workin' at the carnival now.
Lime: Whoo-hoo!
[The audience cheers. But while they were in seats, SpongeBob is sliding on some of them, causing them to fall, causing him to get hit by some of the snow and break.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. [splat in on the snow] Oh, that's enough! Now let's move on to the carnival sign. [Patrick is dangling on the sign] Luckily, I found this one on the scrapheap.
Patrick: A carnival? Oh, I know! Where do you think you're going?
SpongeBob: I found my next target! [throws rubble and snow at the sign] Mortar.
Patrick: What, what, what?
SpongeBob: [looks at the broken sign] I figured if I hit anything ever again, I'd take care of it. [while struggling, he sheds tears uncontrollably and leaves]
Patrick: I guess you're not gonna cry about me being sick or anything. I've worked all day and night to make sure I have the tools you need.
SpongeBob: Okay, have it your way, buddy. I'm here to make sure you have everything you need. [tears pour out of his eyes like he's drowning]
Patrick: Oh come on. What died them two warmongers?
SpongeBob: Oh, a jury would have us frown them down a little. [they walk to the dock] So, it came as a little of my drivndoged that I would be stepping down as artist... [Patrick starts to cry now] ...for being too soft.
Patrick: So, if you're sick of your work and looking for a new job, start with this one.
SpongeBob: I'm starting with what's left of my standing.
Patrick: That's it?
SpongeBob: That's what?
Patrick: That's what?
[As SpongeBob walks back to his station, a giant puddle of green ooze rises up above SpongeBob's green slime.]
SpongeBob: Good day, sir. How's my day, Mr. Bleeding Fields?
Mr. Bleeding Fields: [nods to himself] Oh no, this is no ordinary work.
SpongeBob: I must have been misunderstood! Ahhhh!
Patrick: You're not supposed to talk to green people anymore.
SpongeBob: No, I was not meant to be changed into that. I'm just here to relax.
Patrick: Relax, SpongeBob. Relax.
SpongeBob: I don't care what that means. Let's go.
