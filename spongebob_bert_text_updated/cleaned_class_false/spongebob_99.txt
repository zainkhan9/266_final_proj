[SpongeBob is dragging his legs on the treadmill. He suddenly stops and sees Pat wiggling his legs behind his back. SpongeBob gets furious and he cracks an I'm A-ok, drawing Patrick's face on SpongeBob's face and then more I'm A-ok, drawing his face off his face and drawing back his face. Finally, he draws SpongeBob's face on a brick wall and I'm-ok, drawing Patrick's face and then more I'm-ok, drawing Squidward's face.]
Squidward: [offscreen] Meow-Meow. Meow-Meow. Meow-Meow.
[Squidward jumps off the wall and gets hit by the incoming acid. He pulls out two SpongeBobs and Patrick's Krabby Patties, wipes out the acid, and runs to the door.]
Squidward: [offscreen] Meow-Meow. [SpongeBob and Patrick are walking down the hall and Squidward stop moving]
SpongeBob: Hey, buddy. Want some ketchup?
Patrick: [offscreen] Meow-Meow. [SpongeBob picks up ketchup]
Squidward: All right, I'll get in the kitchen.
[The next scene is later shown. Patrick is pushing SpongeBob to the door.]
Patrick: Meow-meow! [SpongeBob opens the door and Patrick comes out covered in acid residue. He looks down and reveals his face has been pummeled by the acid]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Meow-meow-meow? [SpongeBob opens the door again and Patrick comes out covered in mustard]
Patrick: Meow-meow-meow? [SpongeBob opens the door again and Patrick's nose grows and Patrick's litter stops inside SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Meow-meow-meow? [SpongeBob opens the door again and Patrick comes out with green stains all over her body and Squilliam is shown pouring the liquid into the washing machine]
Squilliam: Hmm, SpongeBob, do you ever wonder what the green stuff is? It's all around us. It acts as a cleansing buff, so your foods can help to clean us off! [Patrick looks at him] Now, what is it about this nearby green stuff that makes us so happy?
SpongeBob: Thank you, Squilliam. It is what makes us so whole. [Squilliam's eyes turn into stars] It is what keeps us going. [SpongeBob looks at green stuff. He then looks at Squidward, who is clean, turning his eyes to stars. SpongeBob stops in mid-air and is engulfed in liquid]
Squidward: [with liquid on ground] It's delicious!
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know why, but I've got a good idea. [inflates himself]
Squidward: [with saliva spray] It's delicious! [sprits it out with his spatula]
SpongeBob: [inflates himself again] It's delicious! [sprites it out with his teeth]
Squidward: [with bloodshot eyes] It's absolutely intoxicating.
SpongeBob: [pushes Squidward] Let's get out of here, Squidward. [Squidward starts moving while being liquidated, and splatters splattered him across the ground. He starts moving again]
Squidward: What the...? [SpongeBob breathes in, and out. They get out of one another]
[They cut back to the Chum Bucket where SpongeBob and Squidward are drying off food]
SpongeBob: We're all done, Squidward. Just care for our water forms and then throw away the rest]
Harold: What's all the lollipop-flavored soup?
SpongeBob: Ah, nothing. Just some pickles for balance. [Squidward starts to sweat]
Squidward: [screams] Spinach! [SpongeBob grabs Squidward, wrap his head around the handle of the water bottle and starts to swallow him] Come here, you slippery monster!
SpongeBob: [slurps the pickles] Spicy!
Nat: [screams and pulls Squidward off the bottle] Spicy... doesn't it guys?! [SpongeBob releases Squidward and goes to the other side of the bottle, but the handle pushes him upward] Do you see those sharp edges? They're coming out of my... [Camera shows that the camera has been cutting away, and it shows Squidward hitting himself in the face with a dump trunk, still attached to the bottle] ...drinks. [whips the bottle]
