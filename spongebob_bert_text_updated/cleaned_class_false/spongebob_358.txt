SpongeBob: [laughs] Why won't you just give up the assignment of letting Squidward do the talking?
Squidward: No. What I want now is for you to become a full-time citizen of the Krusty Krab and, through your work in the kitchen, you'll become our newest chef.
[SpongeBob bumps into Mr. Krabs' butt and happens to pull his butt while doing so]
Mr. Krabs: Hey! That's me! New hostage! Now I can fire you, just sign here!
SpongeBob: New hostage?
Mr. Krabs: No. And I don't want you to turn into a zombie. [points to SpongeBob with his butt]
SpongeBob: New hostage?
Mr. Krabs: No. I want you to turn into a zombie... [gulps] into a zombie.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah! [lifts up his hand]!
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna make it really easy on you! 
SpongeBob: [lifts up his hand harder] YES, YES I'M A ZOMBIE!
Mr. Krabs: ILLUSTRATED!
SpongeBob: [tries to cry] O.K., I am, uhh.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, okay.
SpongeBob: Yes!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah!
SpongeBob: YES, YES, NO! [talking to himself] I'm a zombie now!
