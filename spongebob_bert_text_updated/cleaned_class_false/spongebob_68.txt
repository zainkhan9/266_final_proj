[scene transitions to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Good night, Mr. sponge. [He then walks over and picks up SpongeBob] What are you doing with my money?
SpongeBob: Good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: All right, all right. I spent all my hard-earned money. [He then walks away] I could have sworn I just found a treasure map to Neptune. SpongeBob! [To SpongeBob] Uh-huh. Are you looking for the millionth time, son.
SpongeBob: The map?
Mr. Krabs: What's the meaning of this?
SpongeBob: This is a great map you've made, Mr. Krabs. Keep, keep, keep erasing it, keep, keep, keep, keep! It shows ancient ruins of our time.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, that's very nice, SpongeBob. What do we have to do?
SpongeBob: Since when do we have to use the map?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's just a stupid map, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, I thought you used the map to find ancient Egypt, huh?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's just a map.
SpongeBob: Well, that's just a map, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I thought you used the map to find ancient Peru.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's exactly what I needs, Mr. Krabs!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are walking down the road. Zooms out to show a canyon. SpongeBob digs up more gold. Mr. Krabs bashes SpongeBob's foot.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, my. That's gold that you need to find, Mr. Krabs.
[Mr. Krabs sees SpongeBob's gold and tries to donate it to him.]
Mr. Krabs: Why, thank you, Mr. SpongeBob!
[Mr. Krabs donate the gold to his account. The gold is spent on more expensive items like a chandelier, a wooden trowel, and a chrome fish bowl. Another customer chases after Roger about 20 times. Walks past the customer and swipes Roger's butt.]
Mr. Krabs: Roger!
Roger: [has a chrome fish bowl over his mouth] My soup.
[Mr. Krabs gives Roger some cash. Walks to his office, where he tries to get his attention with the money. Roger chews his own eyes and belches his own money. Roger puts his money away in his wallet, but finds that they are on his ATM. When he pulls his money out, Roger's eyes and his money is gone. The cash jumps away. Later, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs is in his office with an adding machine.]
Mr. Krabs: I've been looking at this thing ever since I saw the nickel. It's really interesting stuff.
[Mr. Krabs hears a slurping noise.]
Mr. Krabs: What is it?
[Mr. Krabs gets his money and slurps it out.]
Mr. Krabs: I'll show you. [He walks over to the adding machine] This machine has to find a way to keep this penny in your wallet.
[Mr. Krabs pushes the button and all the coins are added to the adding machine.]
Mr. Krabs: You work real hard, boy.
[Mr. Krabs puts his hand over his mouth.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, why, why, why? I'll give you a break.
[Mr. Krabs hallucinates as the coin turns into a penny. He screams as the coin turns into a dollar. Mr. Krabs kicks the coin in the air and tosses the coin in the air back into his pocket. The coin dives towards SpongeBob and grabs SpongeBob's eyes.]
SpongeBob: Eye food!
[SpongeBob opens his eyes and sees Larry in the machine arm doing the coinific.]
Larry: Help, Mr. Krabs! I think I made a batch over.
Mr. Krabs: I'd like to order you a single.
Larry: [digs into the machine] Oh, sorry, but I couldn't. I've got the oven extended.
Mr. Krabs: What?!
[Mr. Krabs throws the machine aside and grabs SpongeBob's eyes.]
SpongeBob: Eyes food!
Mr. Krabs: I'd like to order you a single eyes Eugene.
