[The episode starts off with live-action footage of icebergs, but the footage changes to a three-striped, hi-res footage of the iceberg. The first one we see is in the title sequence, where it lands on the ground, bouncing up and down in a slow-motion animation. The second one is in the title sequence, when a blimp flies by with wires attached. It eventually smashes into the iceberg, which itself is a hi-res hi-res picture of the iceberg. It then explodes, sending the ice sheet toppling to the ground. The third one, which has a neon sunset on it, also falls down. The credits then show the episode as a brief recess, with strange images of icebergs in the background. Fred is shown brushing his teeth, but is later shown brushing his unibrow toothbrush.]
Fred: Hey, where were I? [The barnacle raises up in front of him, sending him flying onto the back of the barnacle] Hey, where were I? 
Icelandic Fish #1: Hey-hey, where were I? 
Icelandic Fish #2: Hey-hey, where were I? 
Icelandic Fish #1: Hi-ya, hey-ya. [The two continue hugging] Ha!
[The barnacle raises its head into the air, knocking the episode down. The episode's credits then roll out, showing Bikini Bottom as it was known back in the Klamath Desert. Hans the Pooh is shown watching TV, looking at some rather gruesome pictures. Hans gets angry, and starts to boil the food that is on the grill. The TV then cuts to the inside of the Bikini Bottom Jail, and then cuts to Hans putting up his eyeballs in the chum bucket. Then, Hans eats some of the chum.]
Henry: You know, my job is pretty easy. I just cook for pleasure. [The TV then cuts back to Hans eating the chum. He is still eating the chum]
Hans the Flying Pen: [singing, then back at Hans] Enjoy your prison camp, son. You're less than two bucks out of 10, and free! [then he cuts to another clip of Hans]
Patrick the Mailfish: [singing out of the mailbox, while being chased by barnacles] I got the mail! Signed, is my tract. Hans the Flying Pen delivered!
[Patrick gets hit in the head by the paper he just delivered. He then notices some sort of letter inside the chum bucket. Hans the Flying Pen opens the letter and sees a little box attached. Inside the letter, there is a bunch of bubble wrap and a small box.]
Hans the Flying Pen: [off-screen] Hello, Hans. I'm expecting a letter.
Patrick: [off-screen] Sorry.
Hans the Flying Pen: [off-screen] Your delivery is very nice, Hans.
Patrick: [off-screen] We don't want you doing any good good good good good good good good good good good good things, don't we?
Hans the Flying Pen: [raises his fist] Yeah.
Patrick: [off-screen] We don't want you doing any good good good good good good good good good good good things, don't we?
Hans the Flying Pen: [raises his fist] Yeah.
Patrick: [off-screen] We don't want you doing any good good good good good good good good good things.
[The scene changes to show Hans the Flying Pen outside of the Klamath Desert.]
Flying Pen: Okay, Patrick, since you're so stingy, I'll just take you on a test.
Patrick: [reading a painting] "La Vistas du Boating Préc-Tourist"? That's me!
Flying Pen: Ah! Phew! Very humorous! [closes the letter] Lost copies of me act silly! [throws them away] Nooo!
Patrick: [opens the letter] Dear Pré, Sorry for being such a jerk. I thought you were a funny old pen. How'd you get my autograph?
Flying Pen: Really? Give me your autograph! [Patrick takes away Pré's autograph]
Patrick: My autograph? What about it?
Flying Pen: No! What? Oh, I suppose you want me to have something to hang your-- [Prisoner A rises up]
Prisoner A: What?! You want me to have your autograph?
Prisoner B: Anything! Anything!
