<Start Ep> <3
[Episode starts when a voice on screen says something about a date. The episode opens with a sunset. SpongeBob and Patrick giggle and float down to the Bikini Atol Police Department station.]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody. Uh, hello, officer. Can I help you find your phone?
Officer Nancy: Oh, I can't. One, two, three, [gets hit in the face by a bag of ketchup] all is equal, remember?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I can't do it! I can't do it! It's unfair!
Officer Nancy: Listen, kid. If you want to find your nearest police officer, then follow me.
[The scene changes to show Pineapple State University. It is now night time at the desk.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What year was this professor?
[A police officer walks up.]
Police Officer: I'm looking for Pedro.
[SpongeBob laughs.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, now it's Pedro.
[SpongeBob walks over to a shell with a bat on it.]
Police Officer: I'm looking for Pedro.
[SpongeBob walks up to a purple fish from the movie theater.]
Police Officer: I'm looking for Pedro.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, now it's...
Police Officer: ...Gary.
SpongeBob: ...Gary?
[A fish turns around and sees SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Fish: Oh, I'm so happy for you, sir. Thank you, sir. [grunts as he pulls Patrick] And thank you, sir. [picks up Gary] Gary.
[Gary hides in the corner of the table.]
Police Officer: Oh, Gary! You broke my back!
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream. They both set off an explosion that destroys the shell and SpongeBob laughs heartily.]
SpongeBob: So, how's it going, Gary?
[Gary looks up and sees police cars surrounding him.]
Gary: [catches snail] Meow.
SpongeBob: Hey, look, there's Patrick. I can't follow him around, Gary. Brad's doing something today.
[Patrick enters the classroom.]
Patrick: Brad's going to do something today.
[Brad laughs.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah!
Patrick: Oh, boy.
[Patrick runs out of the classroom and SpongeBob rushes behind Patrick to introduce him.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello.
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: So, today, is going to be a very special day.
Patrick: Very special?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, not really.
Patrick: You want to go on some date today?
SpongeBob: I can't, I have to work tomorrow.
Patrick: Then what?
SpongeBob: Well, I have a very special assignment for you today.
Patrick: Wow.
SpongeBob: Who's on your hand today?
[Patrick stretches his hand. The class stops.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: What?
Patrick: [stretches and taps his shoulder] Work!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are flying high in the sky.]
SpongeBob: [over loudspeaker] I'd love it!
[The sky goes above the clouds and into the police car.]
Patrick: Uh-oh.
[Police cars drive forward and arrested SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh. A tipster writes an assignment. SpongeBob and Patrick both read. Patrick has the newspaper and buys more papers.]
Patrick: Adios!
SpongeBob: Fore!
Patrick: Bumping!
[SpongeBob and Patrick continue laughing. A tipster writes another.]
SpongeBob: And finally, uhh, a tip: Say, Patrick, why we were going to an extreme shelter for sharks hibernating.
[Patrick writes a tipster playing a prank on him.]
Patrick: How does one do that?
[As SpongeBob is writing an assignment, Patrick stops and looks at SpongeBob and Patrick. He pulls his face away.]
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: I don't have time to go to the beach with you!
[Patrick pulls his face away and runs.]
Patrick: Time to get a job doing heavy lifting.
[SpongeBob gives him a lift. Patrick hangs on as SpongeBob glares at him. The tipster writes another.]
Patrick: Finally!
[The tipster writes another.]
Patrick: Time to pass the time of the jungle with the poor guy.
