[The episode begins with Patrick skipping to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hello. I'm SpongeBob, and this is my driver's license.
Driver: [drives the boat] Yeah.
Squidward: Yeah. Uh, we're all drivers, right?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Driver: And we help you clean this place.
[Squidward and SpongeBob nod in agreement]
Patrick: And I helped you clean—
SpongeBob: Wrestes.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Krusty Krab drivers.
SpongeBob: And we helped him clean—
Patrick: Wrestes over loose gravel.
SpongeBob: And we help you clean Eatery.
[Patrick uses a hose to clean up the loose gravel.]
Patrick: And I helped him clean...
[Patrick stops the boat and SpongeBob growls in anger.]
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Yeah!
[SpongeBob looks down and he splatters green goo on his helmet.]
SpongeBob: [annoyed] Goodbye, Krusty Krab!
[SpongeBob runs off and Squidward comes up with a parking problem to make the boat more parking-thirsty.]
Squidward: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Driver: Don't bother me! [sees SpongeBob going to and from the boat] SpongeBob's going to the Krusty Krab! [sees SpongeBob going to the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob's head inside the boat] SpongeBob, wait! [sees Squidward working the grill while SpongeBob and Squidward are going to and from the grill] SpongeBob, wait! [sees SpongeBob finally getting the hang of the hook and is about to get Squidward in the boat when SpongeBob lifts his head up] SpongeBob, wait! [sees the hook getting pinned on the side of the boat with Squidward in it]
[SpongeBob climbs up to the hook, which is getting full of grease]
SpongeBob: Okay! [hook gets full of grease]
Squidward: Maybe I should just crawl under the boat!
[SpongeBob legs stretch out from under the boat, which then collapses to the ground]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward! That's it! I'm taking you with me to the Krusty Krab! I need you... [hook pops out of the handle] Squidward! Take me with me! Oh, what fun is it to drive a boat!?
Squidward: Only a boat! [SpongeBob and Squidward scream as the boat drags them through the mud. Scooter and Mr. Krabs are passengers on the boat as it drags]
SpongeBob: Well, this is it. Now all I need is a demonstration of driving the boat.
Squidward: No, no, no! Don't touch! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
SpongeBob: [enters boat at a 90-degree angle with the rest of the passengers on the front seats] Hey, Squidward. [sees the boat moves 90 degrees under the surface] Did it roll here? Did it ever CHwirl? [nervously eyes move to the back of the boat]
Squidward: Keep your cool, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What neigh?
Squidward: The snail!
SpongeBob: [inhales and blows out his nose] The horse!
Squidward: I can't do it! I can't take off my helmet! [SpongeBob takes off his helmet]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward. I'm out of gas.
Squidward: For weeks, I was. [SpongeBob and Squidward stop breathing]
SpongeBob: You was?
Squidward: [nervously] Yeah. Uh, SpongeBob? You were...?
SpongeBob: No, Squidward. You were just kidding. [Squidward stops his breathing]
Squidward: And did you stop? [SpongeBob and Squidward resume breathing]
SpongeBob: I knew it! [nervously] We're almost out of gas!
[SpongeBob and Squidward finally stop]
SpongeBob: It's almost here! Just stop... [Squidward stops]
Squidward: Stop!
SpongeBob: Stop!
Squidward: Of course I will! What are you gonna do?
SpongeBob: I... joined... a... stupid club!
Squidward: [nervously] I can't join a stupid...
