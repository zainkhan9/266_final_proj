[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is getting himself prepared to go to work. He pushes a platter of bread out of his bag and flips it into the employee dining area, where he prepares to stuff a sandwich on a plate.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, sandwich! [Gets slapped by the manager, and the patty flies onto the floor] This sandwich's ruined! [Shows the word "f---" with a smirk]
Medley Fishbowl: [Opens up a kitchen door] Greetings. I would like to introduce you to a fine artisansman. You would know him from his exquisite detail work of embroidery. [He shows Dorsal Dan a drawing of a patty.]
Dorsal Dan: Why, yes, it is. [The fish on the ground turns around and reveals a golden nose] The nose of Dorsal Dan. [Shows a picture of SpongeBob]
[Dorsal Dan looks at the SpongeBob drawing.]
Dorsal Dan: You will not find a more beautiful fish like him anywhere in the ocean.
[The scene changes to show the exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple. He is washing his hair in the sink. He then shrinks back to normal size.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] I would trade this for any mortal.
Dorsal Dan: Mine? You!
SpongeBob: I've got to help myself. [Opens the door for Dorsal Dan. He takes the pencil and writes something else on it. He gets himself trimmed back and forth and drops the pencil.] Repeat.
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's face. He has been sitting on the front legs and is doing pushups in the background. He hears knocking on the door and goes to knock. He opens it, but drops it.]
Mrs. Puff: Hello, and welcome Quarterly Puff! Whatcha doin', friend?
SpongeBob: Doin' some pressing around here for a new inkblot!
Mrs. Puff: Oh, I ain't used to so much publicity now. It's like a new job. Now, how much'd you do on my behalf, little feller? [Holds up some press]
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Anything for me. [Holds up another press]
Mrs. Puff: Hold it, SpongeBob, that just spook me more than a little bit. Just know that if you can do it, me son will have the perfect opportunity to shine even more brightly.
SpongeBob: Well, hon...
[The scene changes to show Mrs. Puff wearing a pink dress and holding a press.]
Mrs. Puff: And so, my beloved spatulas, get on with it. [She grabs a student newspaper and puts it over her right eye] Get on with the press, you pink lips are meant to entice people into speaking publicly.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, wait, don't. [Opens up a stand with a picture of a spatula on it] It's up to you, my friend here, to bring that public spatula to the next level. [Holds up two mini spatulas next to a picture of a Krabby Patty] Don't worry, Gummy. As... your mouth can understand. [The little spatuler rolls on film.] 1 hour later...[notices SpongeBob behind the papers] Interesting. Nice to meet you, Mr. SquarePants. Can I help you Mr. Squidward? [Spins hands on both Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob. Seeing that he doesn't seem to care]
Mr. Krabs: I would like to introduce our new, trusted narrator. [Opens up a talking paper on the desk] We are the owner and proprietor of a fine and popular family owned and operated business.
SpongeBob: Wow!
Mr. Krabs: The only man I've ever known who didn't value his words more than his words himself. [Holds up the paper]
Narrator: Ah, quiet oie oughtta, Squidward. Now wouldn't that be being a good idea, Mr. SquarePants?
Squidward: No. What would you like Squidward to do?
SpongeBob: I would like to work for him.
Squidward: Are you questioning my leadership? [Laughs] What would you like Squidward to do?
SpongeBob: I would like Squidward to write press releases.
Squidward: Oh, fine. I'll write them. [Holds up a press kit]
SpongeBob: Okay. Ready? Ready! [Goes to the kitchen]
