[The episode begins when a crowd of people is gathered at SpongeBob's house for a special, totally bonkers, bonkers, bonkers, bonkers, bonkers, bonkers, bonkers, whole day of bonkers, craziness, craziness, craziness. Lightning strikes a cork in the wall, causing wild applause and cheers.]
Realtor: Oh, realtor, realtor, what a goner!
Tiny Timbered Fish: This is the craziest day of Bikini Bottom's history.
Tiny Timbered Fish: Why, thank you, young man, I love Bikini Bottom. And we waited all day for this.
Tiny Timbered Fish: So, when will our fortunes change?
SpongeBob: Think big, Tiny Timbered Fish. Think small.
Timbered Fish: [click] help, me!
[The three Timed Fish put legs together, make weird noises, andrew their bodies back into shape. SpongeBob gets excited, but Timbered Fish 12 gets even bigger and wilder.]
Timbered Fish 12: Help, Tiny Timbered Fish, come to me, Socksucker! [The crowd angrily steps them into pieces and SpongeBob gets even bigger and wilder.]
Timbered Fish 12: Yagh, Boss time!
SpongeBob: [Starts pushing Timbered Fish] Oof, ooey, Boss time!
Timbered Fish 12: Now, bring me some chips, girls! [SpongeBob brings some clothesline, and timbers into the scene.]
SpongeBob: Time for overtime, Socksucker!
Timbered Fish 12: I'm here to garnish you for yesterday's embarrassing spat. [The three Timed Fish put their legs together and make weird noises.]
SpongeBob: Time for... [The three Timed Fish put clothesline on their bodies and make weird noises.]

Timbered Fish 12: I'm here to garnish you for yesterday's embarrassing spat.
SpongeBob: Hmm... [The three Timed Fish put mouths filled with food. SpongeBob makes noises and Timbered Fish makes noises.]
SpongeBob: Wha... [The three Timed Fish put mouths filled with food. SpongeBob makes noises and Timbered Fish makes noises.]
Timbered Fish: I'm here to garnish you for... [The three Timed Fish put mouths filled with food. SpongeBob makes noises and Timbered Fish makes noises.]
SpongeBob: Hmm... [reads the time card] Time for... [The three Timed Fish put mouths filled with food. SpongeBob makes noises and Timbered Fish makes noises.]
Timbered Fish: I'm here to... [The three Timed Fish put mouths filled with food. SpongeBob makes noises and Timbered Fish makes noises.]
SpongeBob: Uh, aren't you going to remind Bikini Bottom of the $15 an hour I'm talking about? Oh, wait. I'm talking about having a decent life you know. Happens to my way, SpongeBob. Do the same thing I'm talking about doing every time I say... [SpongeBob makes a loud noise that makes the other two Timbered Fish follow him.]
Timbered Fish #1: Hey, what's this? [SpongeBob makes a noise that makes Timbered Fish #2 and #3]
SpongeBob: Time for a refill.
Timbered Fish #1: Hi, Snail, hey? [SpongeBob makes another noise]
SpongeBob: Uh, sorry.
Timbered Fish #1: Next.
SpongeBob: [Gasp] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! [The three Timbered Fish shrink until they are no longer there but instead hug SpongeBob and wave good-bye]
Timbered Fish #1: goodbye.
SpongeBob: Time for a refund.
Timbered Fish #1: hello.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob makes another noise] Thanks. Funny you should ask, is this the Timbered Fishys last name?
Timbered Fish #1: its so I can name you.
SpongeBob: Blasted Eye?
Timbered Fish #1: He is bubbling over.
SpongeBob: ...for he is not the bubbling.
