SpongeBob and Patrick: Aww!
SpongeBob: Patrick, no!
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: I gotta confess, I was a little concerned about their... stupidity. [laughs]
Kids: Hooray!
SpongeBob: And we thought it would be a good idea to have you join us.
Patrick: We're tourists, don't we say it with pride?
Kids: Yay!
SpongeBob: I can't believe we're doing it together.
Patrick: But... the other guys are paying us to do... [a tour bus comes and takes them in]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [everyone cheering] We're here, we're here! We're here! We're here!
[cut to later, where Patrick and SpongeBob are bathing]
Patrick: Whoo-hoo-hoo! We're getting a tan! [SpongeBob brushes his teeth] Looking good, Patrick! [Patrick puts the toothbrush in his mouth] Now all we need to do is...
SpongeBob: No, wait! I can't wait for my friends time to look after me!

Patrick: Wait! [cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick again thinking]
SpongeBob: One... [SpongeBob turns his rock upside down]

[Cut to the treedome, where the picnic is sitting]
SpongeBob: [looking at a picture of himself with two spatulas] Hey, what's this? This looks great! Why don't we take him down and make him laugh?
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [reading to SpongeBob in high school] Make fun of him! Make fun of him!
SpongeBob: [using a wrench] Patchy! Patchy!
[Patrick imitating him on the walkway]
Patrick: Oh, hi SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: He was just leaving. We can of course take him to the cleaners.
Patrick: We'll even help him clean up the mess he made at the Krusty Krab. Come to you later, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: But what about the fact that he's our teacher?
Patrick: [sighs] I'll take that assignment back for a minute.
[SpongeBob and Patrick crash into the bathrooms and sink. They wash the sink and put on pads to keep them neat. Patrick is wearing a bathrobe and brushing the sink.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get clean in the shower.
[They both enter the shower. They put on soap and enter the tub. They enter the sink and scrub SpongeBob on his head. They both clean the ceiling fan.]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's do it again.
