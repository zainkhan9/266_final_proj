[Scene opens up with the bubble transition to the exterior of the pineapple. The camera zooms in on the sign. Patrick is pushing SpongeBob's tongue]
SpongeBob: Well, that was an awesome view! Let's see those tears fall. [Pants] Kisses and coral trees!
[A Kiss from Patrick starts to move the screen. A bubble transition occurs, and the scene pans out to show a flower from the island with Japanese characters on it. The flower fades to black, and the flower morphs into a football field. The flower jumps into the air and lands on top of Patrick's unicycle. Patrick jumps up onto the pole, takes it off, then puts it back. The flower goes into the freezer, where it is going to eat SpongeBob's house. Patrick takes the flower out, then jumps onto SpongeBob]
Patrick: Thanks.
