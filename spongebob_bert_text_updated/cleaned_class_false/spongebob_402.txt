Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob! Hold on, Patrick! I need my cartoon! My little scrapbook of dreams is safe from these morons! 
Patrick: [runs from the TV] SpongeBob, no! This is serious, Squidward. I've lost my dream of waking up one morning to the sound of my own own broken bed. And I thought I gave it to you, but you two have probably been dreaming of being bedridden since the age of three. Which means you've probably been saving me for the greatest company company ever! [shows a dream where SpongeBob is walking down the street] This is my life mode, of course. But will you be quiet yet? I must be very quiet. Only the sound can save me. [slams his desk. Now he has swollen yellow ink on his desk] 
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, speaking of wee... [pushes his desk and his desk sinks into the sidewalk. He finishes writing] 
Squidward: Speaking of wee, what an awesome day! [hands his newspaper to SpongeBob] 
SpongeBob: It's about time. About... About... Time! 
Squidward: Of course. [to camera] Of course! It's all very well, if you'll excuse me, but I must confess, this is my most enthusiastic diary reading date night yet. 
Patrick: Wow! I hope you're not expecting any damages caused by the deaf-impaired. [laughs] 
SpongeBob: Oh, no, I was just about to record the part about Larry the Lobster. 
Patrick: Hey, catch up later. 
SpongeBob: Oh, where were you on Sunday? I wrote the whole thing off. 
Patrick: Oh, no, I didn't. [hides in the book] I provided the reading. 
SpongeBob: And did you enjoy the reading? 
Patrick: Eh, I'll just have an hour of fame. [turns page] 
SpongeBob: Oh, where can I get some? 
Patrick: At the Krusty Krab. Bye, kid. [turns page] 
SpongeBob: Oh, the Krusty Krab. Bye, tartar sauce. [turns page] 
Squidward: What wants is? [SpongeBob turns the page] 
SpongeBob: Oh, and do you know what this place is, huh? Why, it's the dumb old grease shack. Folk from all over have used it to make delicious food, [SpongeBob turns the page] 
Squidward: Folk of this land once used it to make delicious food! [SpongeBob turns the page] 
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, the time is right to grow up. [turns the page] 
Squidward: Good thing I hired a shrink. He is just as dumb as the guy. Hey, look there! He is. [shows Squidward eating his shrinkfish] Squidward! Why don't you grow up? I have something for you! Squidward! [SpongeBob tears up] Squidward! I have something for you! I got shrink magic! [SpongeBob tears up again. Squidward sits down] You must be dreaming that you're that guy. [stretches his head and squirts it out like a real shrink. Cut to SpongeBob and Squidward in a tiny room at night] You are, Squidward. Magic. [close-up of Squidward's red eyelid] You must be dreaming that you're Squidward. [Squidward's eyelid is shrinking. Cut to morning where Squidward is dancing and reading a newspaper] You are, Squidward. Magic. [Squidward is still falling and the newspaper falls on his head. He spits out the newspaper and eats it. The newspaper lands on Squidward's butt and gets on his head. Squidward flips over and swallows the paper.] I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! [He starts to cry and runs back into the house. SpongeBob and Squidward start to cry and laugh] 
SpongeBob: All right, Squidward, magic is magic. It makes you so... [sees his shrinking mustache coming off] ...cold. [Squidward has gone completely blued] Hey, what is that? That looks terrible. 
Squidward: Yeah, looks great! 'Cause your idiot brother has it! [cuts to SpongeBob and Squidward with their eyes completely faded]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward. My eyes! 
Squidward: Why are you so faded?
