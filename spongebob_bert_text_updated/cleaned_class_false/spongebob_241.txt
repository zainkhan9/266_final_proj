Weatherman: Good morning. All right, everybody. The weatherman says there's a gale from the wind.
Patrick: Gale.
Geologist: Wow. That's wind that blows so freely across this area. Wha-what's that?
Patrick: That's a gust of wind blowing through this part of the island.
Geologist: Oh, yeah. This part of Bikini Bottom is the perfect place for a gale because it's so dern-shaped. [As the geologist thought, a piece of the island falls on top of him]
Patrick: Gah! [gasps] Oh!
Geologist: Wow. A gust of wind blowing through here just blew enough strength to shake the whole surface of Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: What's that?
Geologist: It's what's known as a 'sea-level rise'. [Geologist imagines a scene and it shows Bikini Bottom. The scene changes to show Sandy's treedome. The scene changes to show the island with the greatest amount of rain since the end of time. The island is shown.] Hai! [She hears a crash from outside.

Patrick: Hmm... [The scene changes to show the Bikini Bottom with its crown on. SpongeBob is shown holding a picnic table.] Ahh! The greatest day of the year!
SpongeBob: I'll take the crown, Patrick. [She hands him something and he takes it]

[Sandy gets hit in the face with the sand ball. The scene changes to show the exterior of the Krusty Krab. O'Neil gets hit in the face with the sand ball and gets transformed into a jellyfish. He floats around SpongeBob and Squidward]

SpongeBob: Neat. [SpongeBob floats away. The scene changes to show the exterior of the Krusty Krab. Karen comes out.] Ah, captain. [The scene returns to captain. [A group of robots are shown. They are in a cargo ship with the cargo quarters up front.] We've cleared out Plankton's terror on the island.
Karen: Sorry, sir, you've got a bit of a [The scene returns to captain. Plankton is shown on the ship's cargo ring. He is wearing a visor and holding a balloon. He looks at it. It smells like perfume. Plankton starts to cry and leaves the ship. The scene returns to captain. Plankton is next to the group that showed up earlier.] We wiped Plankton out.

Karen: You did?
