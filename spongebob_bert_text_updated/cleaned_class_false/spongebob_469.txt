[scene transitions to Patrick watching TV]
French Narrator: Ah, the spooky Spookifer, a dried-up leaf litter pile under the surface that's always a little overused a little by Patrick. But it's all starting to pay off. As night falls, mysterious creatures that seem to have been created by the memory of SpongeBob come to life. Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, and Squidward emerge out of the dirt and become friends. As the night fades to morning]
Sandy: This place is scary! Doesn't it just kind of look like home?
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk by]
SpongeBob: Uh, I know this smell!
Patrick: What's this?
SpongeBob: They put a spell on me spellbook.
Patrick: What spell?
SpongeBob: This part of the house is haunted!
Patrick: [he and SpongeBob laugh] We've heard of strange creatures that go door to door in the dark!
SpongeBob: Well, let's just say for all of you what I think is below the surface. [whispers to Patrick. Cut to underwater world where a ghostly blue monster appears and roars] Awww... I think you've really died on rotten coral land. [comes out of the water] Hey, Patrick, is that you!? Curse you, Patrick! Curse you! [runs out of the water with a club on his head]
Patrick: Ooh, hey! [he is a clubbing SpongeBob] Curse you!
SpongeBob: I don't want you anymore! [monster slithers away with club on his head]
Patrick: Hey, buddy! Is this any better, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: No... I mean, no.
Patrick: But, but, but, but, but, but, but!
SpongeBob: [becomes slug] Oh, that's not right.
Patrick: And this isn't just a club spat. [a blue monster appears and roars like a lot of other monsters in the blue monster world] AHHHHHHHHHH!!! [crashes into Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [gasps] Me customers screaming after dark? Isn't that great, Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, what does that mean?
Mr. Krabs: Something went wrong.
Patrick: I'll tell you about what I think is below the surface.
Mr. Krabs: Atlantis? That's a dig at me Atlantis?
