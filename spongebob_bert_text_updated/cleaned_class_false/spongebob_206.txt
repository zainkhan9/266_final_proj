[Mr. Krabs is in his office watching TV.]
Mr. Krabs: [stammers] What a magnificent day. I've got so many more important guests than you.
[The scene shows a wide shot of Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: There's gonna be a lot of money. <0> 
[The scene shows a medium shot of SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: I can hardly wait. [chuckles] Fancy. [sticks a fortune cookie in his mouth] There'll be a lot of money.
Mr. Krabs: No, no wait, Mr. Squidward. We gotta get SpongeBob out of here.
Squidward: [sighs] SpongeBob... must go. [cuts to later where Mr. Krabs is writing money]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [no longer being in the frame and looks like a ghost] Ooh, what am I saying?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I have this under your belt. [shows a black bag with papers in it] We just need to get SpongeBob out of here. [SpongeBob is still in the bag]
Mr. Krabs: Forget this, okay? [lifts the bag with papers in it with a bunch of money in it buzzing] We can do it. [Mr. Krabs tosses the money in the garbage. A bunch of papers fly out of the garbage and land on SpongeBob] Mommy, look at all the money. [SpongeBob gets up and starts to cry] I can't take it anymore. I can't take SpongeBob anymore. I want to know how you're doing. [scene cuts to Sandy's tree house where Sandy is putting her keys on Dennis]
Sandy: [gets the keys] First, [hits him in the head with a baseball bat] hit him with [hits him in the head with a baseball] his bat.
Dennis: [hands him the keys] I'm gonna find him!
Sandy: Thanks for the [hits him in the head with a baseball] bat. [scene cuts to Patrick's rock]
SpongeBob: Patrick, someone missed you! What are you doing?
Patrick: I was just following my rock?
SpongeBob: Maybe that was your misunderstanding.
Patrick: Oh, it's just your rock. Itandyour rock.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, I need to know how you got here. [takes his hand and gives Patrick his hand in a nod]
Patrick: [hands him his hand out of embarrassment] Hey, hand me down. [takes his hand]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think so.
Patrick: Oh, sorry. [takes his hand]
SpongeBob: ...Huh. [Patrick's hand pulls him off] Handee... [scene cuts to SpongeBob]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Can I help you?
SpongeBob: I need to know how you got here.
Patrick: [sits up] Well, I don't know why, but I think I know which way you are going.
SpongeBob: [climbs into Patrick's head but falls off the end of his rope]
Patrick: Hey!
SpongeBob: You know, somewhere, some time ago, Mr. Krabs, something odd happened. [a fish name SpongeBob appears behind Patrick in the distance]
Father Fish: You know what I think of your kid?
SpongeBob: What?
Father Fish: What?
SpongeBob: The stupid Mr. Krabs.
Father Fish: Heh!
SpongeBob: Father Fish, I know where this is going. I just have to ask you two to stop wasting time. [stretches his horse and coughs] Okay.
Father Fish: Now go have fun.
SpongeBob: I really hope this doesn't boil down to a hot, sweaty, ball-shaped score when you look back.
Father Fish: What?
SpongeBob: Don't worry. I know some of you are thinking this is all good, but it is not. This is all about the money. [takes out two-dollar bills] Money that can live in your nice little underpants. Hmm... [his unimpressed wife finds this amusing]
Mrs. Tentacles: You want that? Let's go. [starts walking away]
SpongeBob: I can't believe it's finally over.
Patrick: Oh, what am I saying?
