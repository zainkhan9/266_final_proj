SpongeBob: How was your day at work today, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Ah, what can I get you, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Just this. [Squirts some lemonade]
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
[The scene shows an outward-looking SpongeBob. He drinks the lemonade.]
SpongeBob: You really need to see a doctor.
[SpongeBob makes a convincing story of his heroic deeds. The cameraman turns to the camera, distorted by lemonade. He distorted voice is heard.]
Mr. Krabs: That's right. [The scene returns to the one before.] We did all that we could do, SpongeBob. We lifted all the castles, we ran the gamut of beggars and profligate, we shot every scene we were in, we wrote the plays, we laughed throughout the whole thing, I'm not coming out of this downpour, I swear by the power of lemonade I'm never leaving this place again.
[SpongeBob runs away, crying. The scene returns to the one before.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, SpongeBob. I accept your challenge. Now, let's get out of here.
SpongeBob: Uh, what was that part about running a business that made me cry so much?
Mr. Krabs: That was the part that made you cry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [scoffs] Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Anyway, back to the ol' fast food culture, uh, the... uh, fast food culture. [SpongeBob continues to cry. Cut to later.] Ah, fast food culture, eh? It's all over the place in this town, a place needs a burger... [stops and sees a billboard]
SpongeBob: Now where is this billboard?
Mr. Krabs: Uh-oh. It says something stupid, but it doesn't include it. It only talks about...
SpongeBob: The mall.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, how sorry, boy. [Shows the billboard from previous interview with SpongeBob where he is angry] The mall! Uh, hello, little sponge.
SpongeBob: The mall?
Mr. Krabs: The mall! Uh, hello, little spat. You know, you were looking for a business card, right?
SpongeBob: Well, uh, the part that gets old quicker than pie filling up an old boatmobile.
Mr. Krabs: [Yawns] Hey! A boatmobile!
[SpongeBob runs back into the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Okay, I'm ready! [He grabs a can of lemonade.] The part of the sea that says, "I'm thirsty."
[The sign on the wall for the Krusty Krab reads: "I'm not there."]
Squidward: Oh.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, SpongeBob, what's that?
SpongeBob: Well, it said "I'm not here at this time."
[Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob and drags him in the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, I... I can't! I'm not out of here!
SpongeBob: Well, you can't. That's what the Krusty Krab is for.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, me Krusty Krab is!
[SpongeBob drags his feet.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, barnacles.
[The scene changes to nighttime. A tired SpongeBob stretches his body out, looking tired. Then he crosses his arms over his head.]
SpongeBob: [while he stretches his body out] All right, sleepy head. You'll be fine. [As he stretches his body out, his head goes back to sleep and sighs. He then pulls his body out of the ground.] I already am.
[The scene shows Martha and SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs gives them another can of lemonade. SpongeBob sniffs the fruit.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, this is a nice morning.
SpongeBob: Oh, tartar sauce.
Mr. Krabs: Don't put those bones in, I got a cold.
SpongeBob: Well, why didn't you say so?
Mr. Krabs: Well, tartar sauce is a little dry.
SpongeBob: But you're supposed to be coming home with me.
Mr. Krabs: Dayo, dayo, dayo—o-o-o-o—goodbye, SpongeBob!
