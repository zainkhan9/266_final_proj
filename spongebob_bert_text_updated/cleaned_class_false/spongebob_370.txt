[The scene transitions to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is stitching the register work racks together.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh no. [chuckles] That's too bad we've changed the hours.
[The scene transitions to SpongeBob cleaning tables.]
SpongeBob: Clean...
Mr. Krabs: Clean...
SpongeBob: Clean...
Mr. Krabs: .........
SpongeBob: Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! [leans closely to the stains] Ah! [clenches twice] Ah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
[SpongeBob runs back to the table with a bucket of cleaning supplies in his hand. Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob and holds it up to SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Here ya go! Thanks! Have a nice life, boy!
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs! [goes back to his table] I never thought I'd say this, but I am going to spend the rest of my life working nights as janitor...at night. [takes the bucket of cleaning supplies and goes into the bathroom] Night...at night. [gasps] Wait, that's funny! I thought you were the next janitor!
[SpongeBob sees them go inside SpongeBob's head. The scene changes to themgoing to sleep. Theyall go into the kitchen where Baby Krabs is cleaning walls and ceiling of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob walks over and gets some cleaning gel from the cupboard]
SpongeBob: Hey, it feels good to be freshening. [cleans all the ceiling and bangs the ceiling on himself] Oh, yeah. [sniffs, then gasps] I'm ready!
[They both get up, put the cleaning gel in their mouths, and go back to the table] Nothing like a day spent in the middle of the night with nothing but myself. [sniffs] I can be anything I want. [sighs] I'll just take a nap on the couch I bought. [takes the napkin and just as he sees a tattoo of himself on the side of the wall, he spits it out and goes back to the table, humming]
Mr. Krabs: That ain't negging me.
SpongeBob: Oh, but, Mr. Krabs, there was a time when I was the only one there.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's right, boy-o. You were the one who called Squidward a nymph. And what better way than as your manager, Squidward? I'll make sure you're cleaned up and put away forever?
SpongeBob: Yeah, sir. [skips to the manager knocking on his table] Manager? Well, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome back manager, Squidward! Welcome back! [manager groans] Oooh! He's got shine all over his new face. You know, I used to have a nose like this one, don't you?
Mr. Krabs: What?
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, oh, boy! Are you too cute?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, you are.
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, oh, boy! Are you too cute?
[A robot voice is heard, and it looks like it is forking at SpongeBob and Squidward. It also has scary thoughts.]
Squidward: Are you trying to push a button? Come on, you're not talking!
[The robot knocks on the table again to make a new sheet, SpongeBob looks at it thoughtfully, cuts it, SpongeBob's face looks different, then a picture of Squidward rises up, and it has the words, "You're Inferno Alley's new manager!" written on it]
Squidward: Oh, what the... [gasps] Inferno?! [rushes over to SpongeBob who is next to him, takes the picture, and puts it in the picture] Why, it's the picture of embarrassment SquarePants!
SpongeBob: Oh...uh... [takes the picture] What? Oh, I threw it away! Oh, Inferno Alley, what do I do when I have to use this uh...
