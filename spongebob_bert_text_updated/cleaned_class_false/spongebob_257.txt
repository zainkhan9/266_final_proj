Squidward is shown. He is asleep. SpongeBob enters his house. Squidward dreams about him and the sponge. They are about to invade his house. Squidward imagines them both inside his house. The door to SpongeBob's house opens. SpongeBob and Patrick enter it and see Squidward naked. Squidward pulls himself out of his house. He then goes to sleep on his bed. SpongeBob and Patrick wake up. SpongeBob freaks out and he and Patrick try to hit Squidward, but they hit him anyway. SpongeBob then gets in a big race and beat Squidward up there]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Heave-a-boo!
[SpongeBob is shown in bed with Squidward. He made a huge army of ants out of his toenails. SpongeBob buffs up his army with bad guys]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Bad guys!
[SpongeBob buff his army with good guys. They are shown getting into Squidward's house and doing evil winking. They start to chase him]
SpongeBob: Come on, get out of my house!
Patrick: Nice as that is, a little creepy.
[he walks away, revealing Squidward's house covered in Evil Winker. Good Lord is that room in there]
SpongeBob: Aw, he really is in there?! [he kicks the door. Evil Winker flies in through Squidward's window]
Squidward: [In his sleep] No! No! I'm never gonna get to sleep of him!
SpongeBob: He can't. He's too dangerous.
Squidward: I hope he's not too nasty.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. How are we going to get out of here?
[all that is happening is that SpongeBob's alarm goes off]
Evil Winker: How could you?!
SpongeBob: Good morning, Evil Winker!
Evil Winker: [freaks out] Huh, calm down, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: I'm going to bed now.
Evil Winker: Why are you all puffy towards me?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Did he do what?
Evil Winker: [gets up and notices SpongeBob glaring at him] You're going to bed!
SpongeBob: Why are you all winking at me?
Evil Winker: Why did you make me do this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Because you want to win me crown.
Evil Winker: Well, then, say it!
SpongeBob: Why?
Evil Winker: Because you want to win me soft, hands down.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. [laughs]
Evil Winker: So, you'll be making me your man, you'll rub my pants and make me look...
SpongeBob: Mmmm-mmmm. [laughs]
Evil Winker: So, you'll do me, you'll rub my thighs and make me look good? [SpongeBob smiles] Goodness gracious! [Evil Winker rubs his thighs and makes Patty flop]
Patrick: Oh, good enough. [Evil Winker rubs his thighs and makes Patty flop]
Evil Winker: Ugh, ready for the bath?
Patrick: I hope it's not the bath. [SpongeBob is sleeping and Patrick's laughing]
Evil Winker: Third Timer? [SpongeBob is sleeping and Patrick's laughing] Oh, great. [takes his butt out and puts it back in and puts his belt back on] Do you hear me?
SpongeBob: I don't mind if you do.
Evil Winker: You do?
Patrick: No way. What is it?
Evil Winker: You're looking for the interupt message "I like smelling salts".
Patrick: Oh, no! That's not what I meant!
SpongeBob: [walks Patrick out of the bathtub and into Squidward's living room] Hey, Patrick, what's going on?
Patrick: I don't smell anything.
Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob! What am I gonna do? Do I? [screams]
SpongeBob: I don't know. I don't smell anything.
Patrick: Barnacles! Is this some kind of trick?
SpongeBob: No. Um, it's a trick where you trick...
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: An audience greets you.
Patrick: ...Us.
