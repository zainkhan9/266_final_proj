[The episode begins with Bikini Bottom news.]
Johnny Elaine: It's the Johnny Elaine of Bikini Bottom news. Today, the town reporter walks through town and breaks every story you can think of. [jumps in the air while shaking his head; meanwhile, Squidward walks through the door in his underwear] And so, tonight, we're gonna see the latest on the Squilliam Fancyson family... [pulls out a videotape] where they pride themselves, they go out in the world's most exclusive Bikini Bottom gallery. [jumps through the window and into a room full of customers] And this is just the beginning. [pulls out a casting call box] We're going to have to go on a whole lifetime without that beautiful town square. [holds up a painting of Squilliam] Where they put the gold plaques. [slams the painting down on the floor] Where their put the misshapen, monochrome, umbilical shapes are represented. [pushes a sofa into the gallery] And what better place to show your exquisite suffering than Bikini Bottom? Welcome, my people, hello, Squilliam Fancyson. [Squilliam, who is now gravely wounded, moans and sighs]
Squilliam: [voiceover] Welcome, my people. [Squidward walks up]
Squidward: It's been so hard. I-I can make it up to you. [takes off his hat] I've got to make sure you have my full attention. [in his depression, he ignores Squilliam and goes to the window] Where they put the plaque. [mirror flips around. The back of Squilliam's dress now has a fish look on it. Squidward takes it off] Here let me take your attention. [trips on a light bulb and puts it into his head; mirrors the look of a sad, old man] How about this Squilliam Fancyson take your very eyes and leave them alone for a week. [in his despair, he looks up into the distance and cries]
Squilliam: [in his chair] It's been almost two weeks since my last one.
Squidward: [writing on a notepad] I'll call you back when you're fit. [cries]
Squilliam: [off screen] D-d-d-d-d-d-ob, dod, dod. [runs up to a wall of framed Squilliams]
Squidward: What about the town square? I mean, Barnacle Boy?
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Mr. SquarePants? [spots Squilliam running towards the screen] That's just ridiculous. [laughs]
Squilliam: [running past SpongeBob] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Come on, Squilliam, let's go see Squiddy.
Squilliam: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, lad. That'd be nice and warm.
SpongeBob: Cool.
Squilliam: He's a genius.
SpongeBob: [gasps] This is the last straw! [starts walking towards Squilliam]
Squilliam: N-n-no. You are a genius!
SpongeBob: [walks over to a microphone] I can't believe I'm saying this, but I love Squiddy.
Squilliam: Messy little little thing that's huge and ugly! Wh-wh-why, it's-it's Squiddy.
SpongeBob: Yeah, he's ugly and big and... [laughs] Squiddy? You like that? Hmm, what do you say we tryout something different?
Squilliam: Yeah, tryout something other than Squiddy. Woop-doo.
SpongeBob: [waves hello to himself] Squilliam, are you ready?
Squilliam: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squilliam: Okay. [laughs] Let's get on with it. [running towards Squilliam] Hi, Squiddy.
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: For you to put up curtains at night?
Squilliam: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Maybe we could kickbox and smoke and drink and dance and do all that other stuff later.
Squilliam: That sounds exciting.
SpongeBob: Okay, thanks. [getting ready to run to Squilliam] Well, it's been great knowing you, Squiddy. What do you want?
