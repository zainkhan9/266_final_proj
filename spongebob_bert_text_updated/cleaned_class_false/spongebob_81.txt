SpongeBob: [As he grabs his hat and throws it on the floor] Whoa-oh, there, fells! [throws it on the floor. Then picks it up] Whoo-hoo! [laughs and throws it right where the eggplant is]
[A short time later, SpongeBob and Patrick squat and catch a fly. SpongeBob flies into Patrick's mouth.]
SpongeBob: Ta-da!
[A short time later, SpongeBob and Patrick sit on the floor and stare at each other. A few seconds later, SpongeBob AND Patrick appear.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what'cha doing?
SpongeBob: The new rules! [shows a stack of changes] The fly must now land on the hunk of the eggplant, not the crank!
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob AND Patrick sitting on the floor.]
Patrick: Now, this must be part of the job. [shows a stack of changes]
SpongeBob: [looks at the stack of changes] We can do this elaborate, huh? [shows a stack of changes] We can? [shows a stack of changes] We can? [shows a stack of changes] We can? [shows a stack of changes] Ha! Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob AND Patrick. SpongeBob is holding a VCR and pointing at the tape]
SpongeBob: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, utt!
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob AND Patrick. SpongeBob has already eaten all of the leftovers on the VHS tape. SpongeBob looks at the VHS tape.]
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Perfect. [holds out his tongue and starts chugging] Yummy, uh, Patrick, uh, uh, uh... Patrick... Patrick?
Patrick: [holds out left arm and starts chugging] Yup, yup, yup.
[SpongeBob starts crying and cowers behind a bush. Patrick climbs over the crying SpongeBob and throws the VHS tape aside.]
SpongeBob: Come on, let's go.
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk to the bush. The scene changes to show SpongeBob AND Patrick [CHA-CHA-BA-bop]. SpongeBob climbs up and starts crying. Patrick falls on top of SpongeBob and wraps his tongue around the VHS tape. SpongeBob continues to cry. Patrick stops and reveals his tongue is white and standing on its arms.]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, hey, Patrick. What's wrong, friend?
Patrick: Umm...uh...sorry.
SpongeBob: Hey, uh, Patrick, what'cha doing?
Patrick: Oh, uh, just a little something I like to call 'cheese'. It takes power, and it makes you want to eat it! [pan out to reveal a tall, purple, handsome looking Patrick, who is also wearing fancy clothes, and a hat, and a stomping ground]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Hey, Patrick, what'cha doing?
Patrick: [speaking] Cheese.
[The scene fades to a wide shot of SpongeBob. He talks very fast, and even muffled]
SpongeBob: [While jumping] Uh, Patrick, I'm waiting for you.
Patrick: [While stepping on the ground] SpongeBob, you're my guest. [SpongeBob jumps to the surface, and starts to walk down the line. When Patrick gets there, SpongeBob's mouth is completely covered in cheese. Patrick starts to sweat] SpongeBob? [SpongeBob starts to stop walking, and puts a mask on. He then notices something behind him] SpongeBob? [SpongeBob sees something in Patrick's shorts, and starts to sweat on his face] Oh, hey there Patrick. Where are you? [Patrick sees something behind him, and starts to run to where SpongeBob is going to reach for his shorts] Is something wrong, eh? [SpongeBob reaches for something, and gets squished. He then notices a piece of cheese stuck on his shorts] SpongeBob, what's going on here?
Patrick: Cheese.
SpongeBob: What's going on here?
