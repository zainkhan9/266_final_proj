[episode starts with SpongeBob and Patrick walking through Jellyfish Fields.]
SpongeBob: So, here we are in Jellyfish Fields. [SpongeBob and Patrick are riding on jellyfish] This is the most hypnotizing look-alike jellyfish movie ever. [SpongeBob's head turns into a lava lamp] Whoa! [SpongeBob jumps out of the lava lamp and onto Patrick's chest. As he comes in, Patrick's eyes turn into hearts]
Patrick: Thanks, buddy. I was hoping you would have given this movie to me.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, right. In that case, let me get... [Patrick turns his head to SpongeBob's and screams]
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're a stooge! [flicks SpongeBob's head back into the ground] Whoo-hoo! I took that yellow jellyfish dude's jellyfish! [slaps back his tongue] I took his jellyfish jellyfish jellyfish!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, that was all that was happening.
Patrick: I don't care. [Throws away unopened jellyfish jellyfish and stuffs himself mouth]
SpongeBob: Patrick, the jelly is all mine!
Patrick: Is what you're saying?
SpongeBob: I don't know. But... [He kicks open his front door and runs into Gary's pineapple]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Must have door kicked open! [picks up Patrick] Good choice. [picks up Gary] Gary, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Come now, I'm not just walking you through with a mop. [He puts on SpongeBob's stupid hat] I'm asking you out here with me. [walks away] Well, good luck with that and have a nice life of mediocrity. [walks through a bush] Hey, where's Patrick? He's too slow. What's he doing? [walking by a cactus] Why, he's moving too fast. [dials the number on his hat] Patrick! Get him! [Patrick looks back at SpongeBob] Maybe he's in trouble. [SpongeBob gets on Patrick's shoulders] Just ask him. [walks up to Patrick] Don't be scared. He's a human brain is what he needs. [takes his hat off his head] This is just my wig. [puts it on] No touching. [Patrick turns it on] You're welcome. Really understand, Patrick.
Patrick: What's wrong with my wig?
SpongeBob: Oh, you know, one of the things I love the best, it's the completely honest look. Actually, the only thing going on in my head is the best look. Is... [Patrick puts his hand in SpongeBob's mouth] Can I get you anything else, now?
Patrick: Yeah, anything. [takes out a phone and calls the diary]
SpongeBob: [turns the lock] Morning.
Patrick: Morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What could be in that bag, Gary? [pan over to the TV where a bag is on the ground with Gary in it]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [reads the bag] "237 nights with Gary?" Gary? It's the funniest thing I've ever heard!
Gary: [yelling] Meow!
SpongeBob: I know, I know, that story is funny, but only if you give me one thing. [points to a videotape] This moment from memory is why I love Gary. [flashback to that night where SpongeBob is at his house with Gary, Patrick, and Squidward] Now remember, when I took your last bath... [happy birthday] I made him cry. [SpongeBob smiles and makes faces]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Hold on, Gary, I've got something I'd really love to see today. [happy birthday. Dale's delivery  washes the bags over more bags]
Delivery Man: [walks out of his office] What do you think of this shing, hm?
Delivery Man 2: [jailbreak] You will be sentenced in three months for simple transportation.
SpongeBob: [immediately perks up and walks out of the office] Hmph! [jumps behind the wheel] I got a gong. [crashes into Patrick's rock]
Patrick: This thing is coral!
SpongeBob: Uhh, what do you say it is?
Patrick: What do you say it is? [SpongeBob lets go of his head and it rears up]
