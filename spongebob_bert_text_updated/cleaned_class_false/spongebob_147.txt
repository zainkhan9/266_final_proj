[The episode begins with a morning at the Krusty Krab. An angry customer takes Squidward outside the door to attack.]
Squidward: Why am I even here? My employees are too pushy. [customers yell at each other] Hey, what's with the bumbling roustin'?
[Squidward destroys a table, while four employees are placed in boiling water, demand an order for a puddle of boiling water.]
Squidward: I'm sorry, your patties taste better than water. [takes order of patties from the customers]
Mr. Krabs: Wait! Before I hand over the password, let me just...
Squidward: Please? I don't want to give away the password.
Mr. Krabs: It would ruin your chances at working with the press.
[Mr. Krabs pushes Squidward out of the way, and jumps on Squidward. Squidward falls and starts to whimper. Mr. Krabs gives Squidward back the thumbs up.]
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, Squidward. [Squidward starts to get upset] Not another word about ordering all of your patties on the same day, eh?
[Squidward bangs his head on the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Good luck, Squidward. And don't come back until you've signed all the seals.
[Squidward sighs. Mr. Krabs tosses Squidward out of the Krusty Krab. Squidward jumps on the cashier boat, but gets bounced back. He sits up, and sees that the cashier guy has removed the surly quality from the food.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, please don't come back.
Squidward: I'm not really doing this, am I? [gasps] The floor is rough. I guess I'm not safe with this. [whacks the cashier guy] Hey, that's not so nice. [points to the cashier guy again] I know you're here to see Squidward because I worked here. Now pay attention, the Krusty Krab, every employee is entitled to a fair shake.
Mr. Krabs: What are you trying to say?
Squidward: Oh, just the day the restaurant was created. [starts out by saying hello Mr. Krabs; then he disappeared] All I want is to be remembered as a creator like myself.
SpongeBob: What is that?
Mr. Krabs: Just him. [SpongeBob's house in ruin]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: What? After all this, I can't get any work at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: That's just the one.
Squidward: It's got to be more.
SpongeBob: [whimpers] How'd you get over that line?
Squidward: I can't do it. I'm too soft.
SpongeBob: How did you enjoy working at the Krusty Krab?
Squidward: All the sauces I could think of. I'd love to work at one of those fancy...
SpongeBob: P.U.!
Squidward: Yeah.
SpongeBob: ...kara-tay!
Squidward: Go ahead. Say "uneen".
SpongeBob: Uh-en. What is he?
Squidward: He's... I don't think he's right.
[Mr. Krabs is on Squidward's doorstep]
Mr. Krabs: Here you are, boy. Take your time.
Squidward: Not so fast, SpongeBob. What is he?
SpongeBob: Why, he's nothing but a dream. I can't go to work with them like that. They're top...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't go to work with that attitude!
Squidward: [stuttering] They're top!
SpongeBob: Well, but what about the customers?
Mr. Krabs: We are not being asked to work in a cubicle!
Squidward: That's not what you said.
SpongeBob: We are going to be in a Krusty Krab with my best employee, Squidward! [They are to be in a room within a building] That's it! No need to call me Squidward!
Mr. Krabs: Well, you said he was a top employee. And you said he should be in the Krusty Krab. Well, that was close.
Squidward: No.
