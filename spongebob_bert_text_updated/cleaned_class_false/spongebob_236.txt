[Squidward: Ooh, I know what you're thinking. I don't care. I just want to know...when...are...these cards gonna leave?
SpongeBob: Wait! I know exactly how to that!
Squidward: Fine! [takes out his quarter] Mint! Take that, your clarinet. [claps]
[Squidward walks over to his clarinet and sings it with his hand on the heart.]
Squidward: Mint...is...ehhhh...right! [inhales deeply]
[Squidward chants "Mint" as he suddenly stops and looks up at his watch. SpongeBob and Patrick stop in front of his bed]
SpongeBob: Are you sure you're ready for now?
Patrick: Is it time already?
SpongeBob: [leans closer] Yeah, Patrick? Do you mind if I turn it up to...
Patrick? [Turns it up to how much Intoxicated Squidward is] Oh, 0.1...0.0?
SpongeBob: Better Close...0.1? [The window is shown. As the second half of SpongeBob screams, the first half is still going]
Squidward: Better close...0.1...0.1?
SpongeBob: Better close...0.1...0.1? [Close to how close his windows are]
Patrick: Wait, close... [Takes a card and draws a circle] 1, 2, 3, 4...
SpongeBob: 2, 2, 1, SpongeBob! Get those cards out of there!
Patrick: Oh, cards. [Comes out of SpongeBob's ear] Hey, what's this? [Looks in the card and draws a pencil. The pencil comes out of Squidward's ear] Papers?
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick.
Patrick: Hang on, Paper John, that's all day.
SpongeBob: [Starts writing. Kicks pencil dust off] Prepare to be filled to bursting with ideas!
Patrick: Let's do this!
[Patrick races, but struggles to get out. SpongeBob presses a button on the control panel and the pencil comes out deformed]
Patrick: Paper, don't do that!
SpongeBob: [Screams]
Patrick: Oh, no!
SpongeBob: [Takes paper off his head] Prepare to explode!
[SpongeBob sucks in more cards and they fall on Squidward. He throws them up into the air and laughs]
Squidward: No more cards, ow!
[He picks up one and laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, meet The Pink-Helmeted Man!
[He walks away.]
Patrick: Oww, good idea! I'll look after this. [Starts packing Squidward's stuff]
Squidward: All finished! [He ends up in a bag] How refreshing. [Picks up his stuff] Ooh, Patrick, you got a lot of stuff in that bag?
Patrick: Oh, I do, buddy.
Squidward: Uhh, what do I bring?
[SpongeBob brings the bag and the bag is covered with cards.]
SpongeBob: A card!
Patrick: A card!
SpongeBob: A card.
[The bag is empty.]
Patrick: A card.
[SpongeBob points to the cards on the floor where flies of flesh and bones and tears of joy are shown.]
SpongeBob: A card.
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's face.]
SpongeBob: A card.
[SpongeBob takes out a knife, cuts it off, and takes out a flashlight. He looks inside it.]
SpongeBob: A flashlight.
[He screams. SpongeBob turns on the flashlight and the lights go out. The light bulbs turn on and the flashlight dims. SpongeBob hides behind the lamppost and shines a light on the cards, which are cards.]
SpongeBob: A card.
[The scene changes to show the interior of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: A card.
[A card that reads 'WANTED: Titanic' begins to appear in the light.]
Karen: I've heard of this one.
[Karen imagines the card saying, 'I saw you tonight and now I'm gonna kiss ya']
Karen: No one wants you anymore. But if you're here, then we're gonna bestow you the very best card in the whole town.
SpongeBob: Well, then, I guess that I can be anything I want.
