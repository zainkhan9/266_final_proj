SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward, we still have the rest of the day.
[Patrick starts the boat and SpongeBob the pilot goes out in the open. He drives out of the garage as Squidward sadfully sleeps in his bed. SpongeBob drives the SpongeBob the Bear with the throttle issue.]
SpongeBob the Bear: See you later. [head goes up and he's still asleep]
[Squidward sobs uncontrollably. SpongeBob drives out of the garage and drives into the garage door. SpongeBob the Bear comes back from his night in bed. He looks in the mirror and sees that he was naked.]
SpongeBob the Bear: Mmmmhaa! [turns to face Squidward] Squidward, you are a sin.
Squidward: [gasps] He was. [grabs SpongeBob's arm and pulls it back up] But I choose you over science.
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, science. Yes, yes. [pulls his legs apart to reveal underwear] Yes, I could wear this! [feels himself dripping wet]
[SpongeBob goes to plug himself in the outlet, but it doesn't work. He accidentally trips on himself and gets himself soaked again. He puts his foot on the ground and puts his foot into the outlet, but it still doesn't work. SpongeBob the Accidentist drives to the front doors of several academic and library houses.]
Scientist: Well, we can show you everything that could have caused this.
[The scene changes to the next day. Squidward is in front of the printing press.]
Squidward: [widgets over paper] How could you?
Press Office: We're sorry, sir. It was not in your nature.
Squidward: But it was a good idea.
[The scientist gives him a pair of scissors and he removes the newspapers from his head. He laughs]
Press Office: Sorry, sir. It was not in your nature.
Squidward: But...but...it was a good idea.
Press Office: Well, that's what we did to you in the past...
[Squidward screams. The scientist gives him another pair of scissors and he removes the newspapers from his head. He laughs. The scientist gives him another pair of scissors and removes the newspapers from his head. He laughs. The scientist gives him another pair of scissors and the surgeon pulls out a cast and saw and cuts out the newspaper casting.]
SpongeBob: [wipes the newspaper off his head] Looks like some horrific shroud.
[Squidward is confused. The surgeon casts the newspaper in the dirt and on Squidward's bed where the stitching is]
SpongeBob: [screams] This is the greatest day ever.
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob comes into the restaurant with a plate full of Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Here's your plate.
Squidward: [whispering] Ah, gee, SpongeBob. such an honest face.
[SpongeBob gives him a plate full of patties.]
SpongeBob: [whispering] What?
[Squidward puts the plate on his head.]
Squidward: Here's your plate.
[SpongeBob gives Squidward the plate.]
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: [laughs] Thank you.
[SpongeBob gets his acting teacherate.]
EDUCATION
SpongeBob: Edifying, eh? Well, I guess that's more like it. All I did was get a certificate in the subjects I followed. Now I just have to pass a science test. Oh, I can't wait.
[SpongeBob sulks off. The scene changes to SpongeBob going to the movies. He comes out and he has a ticket. He comes back with a ticket and it is sitting on the counter.]
SpongeBob: I took the ticket.
[SpongeBob takes the ticket and runs inside the Krusty Krab. He is at the movie theater. He brings out his clarinet and starts to sing.]
