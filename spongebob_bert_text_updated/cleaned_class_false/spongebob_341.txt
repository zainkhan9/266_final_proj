[The scene starts with a shot of the Krusty Krab. The scene fades to a wide shot of the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob is shown holding Plankton's phone.]
SpongeBob: Hey there, Plankton's number's. It sounds pretty up your sleeve. Are you ready to go jellyfishing?
Plankton: Sure. Where do you want me fish from? Call me. [Plankton belches on the phone.] Hey, Plankton, what's your name?
SpongeBob: PlanktonPants.
Plankton: Uh, SpongeBob SquarePants? I'm sorry, could you get me a Kelpy Fong pizza?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Plankton. Can I take your order?
Plankton: Don't try to take a better look. [Plankton doesn't care.] Pizza? [Looks at SpongeBob.] No.
[Plankton gets a blank look on his face.]
SpongeBob: Well, I took your pizza.
Plankton: Well, pizza. I'm not a pizza expert.
SpongeBob: Really? Let's try.
Plankton: Sure thing, SpongeBob. [Laughs.] I'm not a pizza expert.
SpongeBob: Well, I got a..
Plankton: D'oh! Ah! What's that?
SpongeBob: I said, I know who owns these exclusive, secret clubs.
Plankton: Ah! What?! [Starts laughing. To SpongeBob] They're run by dicks.
SpongeBob: Don't look anymore. They are just my fancy club.
Plankton: Ah! But how can I know who owns these exclusive, secret clubs? I'm rich!
SpongeBob: Well, that's what I said!
Plankton: Well, tell you what I said! [Laughs evilly] I'm rich!
SpongeBob: Well, who owns these exclusive club balls?
Plankton: They're all yours, SpongeBob. [Looks at SpongeBob's money.] They're all bought and paid for by me.
SpongeBob: Who owns these balls, anyway?
Plankton: No. These balls are my property. They don't belong to me.
[Scene cuts to the gang having lunch.]
Plankton: Well, that's an excellent explanation as to why there is no crime. There's no crime, Mr. Tentacles! There's no crime at all!
Mr. Tentacles: That's right. And I don't believe there was any kind of crime at all! There's no crime at all!
[Scene cuts to the police officer dressed in a crown with a warrant in his hand. He is walking around with a baton in his belt. He is carrying a mop and hairpiece]
Officer: Well, this looks like the guy who did it.
Mr. Tentacles: That's right, yeah.
Officer: Well, give him a minute. [Goes to the table and points to the mop and hairpiece] Here, let's see. [Holds on a nightcap] No, not that. [Holds on a black cap] What do you think he is, Mr. Tentacles?
Mr. Tentacles: I don't know. Why not slap his face? [Then someone takes a picture of SpongeBob holding a sign reading, "He's Not Coming"] That's it. Thank you, my good man. I think you should answer these calls in detail. [Holds on a megaphone] Who owns these exclusive balls, sir?
Officer: [In a Scottish house] They're imported, sir.
Lady: Oh, depreciate me, Sir. [Holds up a Scottish man in a ship] These imported balls are given to me by my cousin Blackbeard. He gives them to me by ship.
Mr. Tentacles: You know, this is just your dumb, beautiful, lovely balls, not mine. [Holds up a blue one] I have a right to own 'em.
[Scene cuts to Mr. Tentacles' ship in the sky.]
Mr. Tentacles: [As a torch is shining on him] I'm ready, Captain.
Captain: Hurry, Mr. Tentacles. Uh, are you enjoying my beauty sleep, Captain?
Mr. Tentacles: [Sleeps on the deck, then wakes up after hearing music from outside] Yes, Captain!
