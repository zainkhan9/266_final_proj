[The episode begins with Patrick watching a cartoon on TV]
French Narrator: Ah, comeset-toed-toed, done! Don't you get it, SpongeBob? This is a cartoon, after all. And there's the problem! The culprit is not you, but rather: the annoying news person, who wishes to remain unnamed. The annoying news... WFAN turns out to be a hoax, a catch-all term for a far-right fake news outlet. Failing your fake news site site scores you a spotty online reputation. But if you want to be seen as a fake news site, you'll have to replace it. And that's where our talented employee... [the employee puts a brick on SpongeBob's head and a hammer in place] ...comes in. Can you believe that guy doesn't really know what he's talking about? Meh, I know. [SpongeBob walks into the kitchen of the Fake News Society [fake news society] and gets his news tip]
SpongeBob: This is the most requested of all my tips. I'm the head of a... [cut to a TV that has a skull on it] ...fake news TV outlet. [shows the skull on the screen]
Johnny: This is the real deal.
Nat: I've never been a fan of 'The Onion's'.
Nathiel: Nathiel. It's funny, I was just following your career.
Nat: Yeah. You don't give a [fake news] story any airtime.
Nathiel: I hate to admit it, but I've never been a fan of their [fake news] 'odey'.
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh, Nathiel, you got one more thing going on today. [apologizes]
Nat: I hate to admit it, but I've never been a fan of their 'odey'.
SpongeBob: Sorry I'm late. [runs back to Nathiel] Sorry I'm late. [Nathiel laughs] You were right. Fake news is not good. [runs over to a billboard] Here's another thing that needs to beusted. What's your favorite?
Nat: Actually, I'm most appreciative of the answer.
SpongeBob: [Nat runs off and comes back with a list] Here's the list.
Nat: Let's see, it's over 100,000 things you could be wearing.
SpongeBob: Um... yeah, yeah. Okay. Uh... excuse me, sir, I'm early to join the con.
Nat: Oh, really? Let's wait and see. [Nat runs off. SpongeBob runs off too]
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, sir.
Mr. Krabs: [coming back to the Krusty Krab] Good morning, your Grace.
SpongeBob: I don't work here, sir.
Mr. Krabs: [from inside] Therefore, I revoke your membership in the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: I can't believe a thing a little 14-year-old could do! [holds up money] Now, if I were you, I would halve that coinage for you! [crowd cheers. SpongeBob runs over]
SpongeBob: Wow, what a great day! Way to go, little guy.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I just wanted to...
SpongeBob: Don't tell me. You found out that the... uh, the secret-hoedileile is actually a scammy yellow toilet paper vessel.
Mr. Krabs: It sure is, boy! I guarantee it's the envy of the world!
SpongeBob: I know, you're just shy of $1,000.
Mr. Krabs: It sure is, lad! What do you have to lose?
SpongeBob: The penny. [holding up the penny] There's a guy who goes by the handle like the devil, hmm? ...[tears up] ...who makes millions out of time and money! [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: That's enough, me boy, you saved the Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob: Yeah! He's gonna launder some of that money!
Mr. Krabs: He did? Is that what you do when you get caught with a gander?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. I'm a gander.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.
SpongeBob:aunder that money!
Mr. Krabs: He did?
SpongeBob:Yeah. He did. He did?
Mr. Krabs: He did?
