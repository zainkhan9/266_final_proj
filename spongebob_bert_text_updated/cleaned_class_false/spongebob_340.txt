SpongeBob: [as he runs to the Krusty Krab. He stops at the door and Squidward opens the door] Mr. Krabs, are you there yet?
Mr. Krabs: [Looks behind him and SpongeBob turns to SpongeBob] Can I help you, boy?
SpongeBob: Sure. [Pants]
Mr. Krabs: Good work, boy! [Walks SpongeBob aside] Well, I can't just stand by while I do. What am I going to do? What am I going to do?
SpongeBob: [Walks SpongeBob aside] Leave me to decide.
Mr. Krabs: Stick with me, boy.
SpongeBob: Then go. [Walks SpongeBob aside]
Mr. Krabs: That's it. [Stands in front of the door. SpongeBob walks in]
SpongeBob: Whoa...Whoa...Whoa...Mr. Krabs! What is it? What is it?
Mr. Krabs: I need someone who's not just another fancy fry cook.
SpongeBob: Someone I could really fall for. Something I cannot do alone. I.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I. [Walks SpongeBob aside] Yes, you are a great friend. Yes, you are a great friend.
SpongeBob: So, you'll be my special guest?
Mr. Krabs: Actually, I've bested you with my own little magic trick. [Trips a Krabby Patty and spins it around. He then absorbs the Krabby Patty and spins it around again. He then functions like a fry cook with the spatula as his measuring stick] Yes, I've never had a spatula before.
SpongeBob: Wow! Can I be special?
Mr. Krabs: Actually, now take a look.
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir. [Hands the bag]
Mr. Krabs: And now, prepare to smell like the ripe tomatoes in...place...something very important. [Begins to grow tired] Oh, boy. [Tries to open it] SpongeBob? Nope. Nope. [Still smelling] Still nothing. [Tries to open but holds up a paper saying "U.S.A.N.P.S. I Can See Now" Attempted] Still no answer. [Still smelling] Still no answer. [Still smelling and laughing] Still no answer! [Still no answer when he says "You"] You can't say no, Mr. Krabs! You've been holding me back!
SpongeBob: [Whispering] I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That's exactly what I had in mind when I said yes to your proposition!
SpongeBob: Well, what is it about you that makes us great?
Mr. Krabs: Well, the fact of the matter is, these advances in taste have made some of the people I know taste great. [Now a stockholder in a company] SpongeBob is right behind you, Mr. Krabs. We must help them.
SpongeBob: All right, I'll believe anything you say. [Mr. Krabs takes his seat]
Mr. Krabs: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: I believe me lips.
Mr. Krabs: Well, there's no reason to be bored here. This is a high-paying, high-living establishment. Free food, drink, and entertainment available to anyone. [SpongeBob shows Squidward a sign reading "RIOT ISLAND" and Squidward becomes fascinated] The only place in the world where you can order the big-name live entertainment?
Squidward: That's exactly what I had had 'arrived'... on the dotted line.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's just brilliant! With over 1,100 employees, we can produce a million different shows a year!
Squidward: What a great idea!!
Mr. Krabs: Well, what do I know. Squidward, are you sure?
Squidward: It's easy, just follow me.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk to the front doors]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You bet. Let's go get a show.
SpongeBob: Are you sure?
Mr. Krabs: I'm sure! I'm sure this is it! We've got big TV, great food, and a great mayor let live go! [Jumps into Mr. Krabs and goes to the table where Elaine, Debbie, and Old Man Jenkins sit down] Now let's get our shows.
