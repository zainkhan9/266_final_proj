SpongeBob: [Writing on a roll of toilet paper] Are you sure you didn't forget the budget, Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can fix that. [Pushes SpongeBob out of his house] Take a look around. [Looks through the window and SpongeBob is gone]
SpongeBob: Well, I guess it's plain to see that I failed again. [Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' house] Getting ready for bed. [Tries to blow the bubble to blow the alarm, but it won't close]
Mr. Krabs:  Good luck with that. [Gets Out]
SpongeBob: Wake up, Mr. Krabs. Wake up. [Whispering] I'm warning you: Wake up! [The bubble wanders around inside his head and pops.] Wake up! Wake up! [The bubble pops as it goes to the door. Mr. Krabs opens the door.] 
Mr. Krabs: Why, me boy? 
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs. 
Mr. Krabs: Hey! What's wrong, boy? 
SpongeBob: [screams] The bubbles! 
Mr. Krabs: Wake up, me boy! 
SpongeBob: Wake up! [Whispering] I'm warning you: wake up! [The bubble wanders around in the bubble, trying to blow the alarm. Mr. Krabs picks it up.] Wake up! [The bubble wanders around in the bubble, trying to blow the alarm. Mr. Krabs opens the bubble.] Wake up! [The bubble wanders around, near being crushed. He picks it up.] Wake up! [The bubble wanders around, next to a cauldron containing crushed music.] Wake up! [The bubble wanderer opens the cauldron.] [Notices crushed music] What the...? [Cries]. The bubble wanderer. [The bubble wanderer goes back into his cauldron. Mr. Krabs gets Mr. Krabs out of the boiling pot on the stove.]
Mr. Krabs: Nothing too spectacular, I guess. Just a little stuff on the ear.
SpongeBob: [Appears hugging the bubble wand] Thank you, Bubble Womb. 
Mr. Krabs: No problem, Bubble Womb. 
SpongeBob: Thanks, Bubble Womb. 
Mr. Krabs: Bubble Womb. 
SpongeBob: [Screams] My eardrum hurts! 
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, I don't care. Wake up, Bubble Womb. 
SpongeBob: [Walks out of the kitchen] I see you're not happy about my friend here. You keep telling me to get out of here, but I've never been here before now. Do you stop, SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob: Hey, we can't have a bubble anywhere. We have to find and banish the evil.
