[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is marching around like a military drill sergeant while wearing a solider helmet.]
Mr. Krabs: Now, we're all out of uniforms. Here, take these. [holds up his own uniform] These are his uniform. This should be just the thing I need. [the drill sergeant looks through the helmet and there is a long line of green uniforms]
 Drill Sergeant: Welcome to the Krusty Krab! [laughs] I'm sure this is the place for you, fellers.
 Borrowed Krabby Patties: Oh, Mr. Krabs! These are the greatest substitutes for old food. These new sprouts are no exception. [two yellow sprouts sprouts up from the ground] Ta-da! You're a true pioneer, Krabs. [he laughs]
 Mr. Krabs: [comes out of his office] What do I know about that? [his eyes widen] Those eyes are on a case. [puts the scar on them] What did I miss?
 Spongy Spongy: Those eyes? Don't be alarmed, Mr. Krabs. These guys are extremely gentle. [laughs]
 Mr. Krabs: That's because these guys are lactose intolerant. [his face becomes dark as a blood sugar meter crumbles] Makes lactose intolerant people.
 SpongeBob: What happened to you?
 Mr. Krabs: This isn't depression. This is... [covers his ears] ...a form of laziness I've never heard... [smells SpongeBob's nose] ...a laziness that's accentuated by the presence of a looming nervous system. Hmm, I know! What's he gonna be? What's he like?
 SpongeBob: [covers his nasal cavity with his foot] I don't know.
 Mr. Krabs: Al, chase me!
 Al: [carrying SpongeBob to and from the kitchen to the table, while groaning] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [slaps SpongeBob] Al! Let me help you carry your old box to your table. [slams the box on to the table, while carefully scraping the top with a pair of pliers] A little less rubbing, and a touch of bray. And don't worry, I'll be back soon.
 SpongeBob: Aw, I've got all the essential supplies.
 Mr. Krabs: [gasps] SpongeBob! You're not going anywhere! [he runs off as the sea bear chases him]
 SpongeBob: Please, tell her! She'll be happy for you! Al!
 Sandy: Wait! You're not going anywhere! [the sea bears follow Sandy outside the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Sandy! Sandy! Come back!
SpongeBob: It's okay, Sandy, she's not going anywhere.
 Sandy: Oh, please, don't eat me! I am so hungry! SpongeBob, Sandy!
 SpongeBob: [chuckles] Okay, Sandy. Sandy, I need you to come with me to the Stadium. [leaves]
 Sandy: Wait! SpongeBob! I need you to come with me to the Stadium. [leaves]
 SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy. Oh, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry to have had you, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
 Sandy: Well, the stadium is too far out!
 SpongeBob: Oh, it's too far out! Let's go! [they walk along the field]
 Sandy: I can't leave! [she screams and hits the stadium security guard. He opens the ticket office and laughs at his annoyance]
