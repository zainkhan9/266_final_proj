SpongeBob: Just like the opening themes, "Hey, Patrick!" and "It's Coming!" Starfish time! [SpongeBob's alarm clock rings. SpongeBob claps his hands together and then does the same while going around, sometimes not stopping for any reason] Time to pack, SpongeBob! [runs into his closet, but he gets sprayed with water] Oof! [his broken spatula is everywhere] I've got to get going. [screams when he drops his spatula and flips the broken spatula on its bed] I can't go back to sleep now. I need to concentrate! [stops sprinkling water on SpongeBob and looks through the window of his house at Gary's house] Gary, there's something I want you to know, something I can't handle! Something I won't get at home! [throws some dirt bags and a crate] It's no use, Gary. I'll just sneak over to SpongeBob's house early and grab the secret formula. [stops dirt sliding off of SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob, you've gotta be more careful, or you'll get... [sees Gary's rock, which is actually snowing] Gary! What is that thing? [sees Gary's rock, which is actually snowing] Oh, dear Neptune. It's... not there. [Gary steps out of sight, and marks the spot where SpongeBob's rock was] I better stop that! [two big arms come out of the ground come out, and SpongeBob stands up] What are you, two? Are you... Neptune?
[SpongeBob tries to sneak over, but gets sprayed with water. Neptune comes out, and blocks the road. SpongeBob comes out, and is very confused. He sits in his chair, and SpongeBob gets sprayed with water again. SpongeBob sits up, and the fence comes off, and blocks the road again. Neptune comes out again, and blocks the road again. SpongeBob comes out, and is very angry] NO! I am not SpongeBob Neptune! [He is buried under several trees. Later, a bulldozer comes over with a motor, and starts to move the bulldozer closer to the house. The bulldozer moves faster than the house moves, and SpongeBob sits up, and the motor starts to move back and forth in slow-motion, causing the house to come closer to the tree. The motor then starts to move away from the tree, and SpongeBob sits up, and the motor stops after about 15 seconds, causing the fence to come down, and the whole house to come closer. The fence then starts to move closer, and SpongeBob sits up] You're just being very difficult to get rid of. [about 15 seconds later, he hears a crunching sound, and when he looks up, he sees that the ground shaking, and he turns his chair over so he can sit on it] SpongeBob, what are we gonna do?
SpongeBob: It's gonna be tougher than I imagined.
Patrick: That's when my ear accidentally pressed against your ear.
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: When?
SpongeBob: In the middle of the street where the Chum Bucket is.
Patrick: Oh. [fades out]
SpongeBob: [takes out a pencil and draws a line so that the bucket can go next to the Chum Bucket] What do you think, Patrick?
Patrick: I'm gonna go next to the Chum Bucket and paint it red. And then I'll make money off of you!
SpongeBob: Then I'm gonna paint it all over your SpongeBob costume. [SpongeBob draws a picture of SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob laughs evilly, and Patrick draws pictures of SpongeBob's face, arm, and legs. Then SpongeBob puts the pencil back in his head and starts to think.] Is that what I think? Are you gonna paint me or next, [draws a vicious circle] and butt me? [the pencil goes under Patrick's shirt, under his pants, and under his shell, and goes back under the bed] How dare you attack my art!
SpongeBob: I have always been attracted to fine art. [draws a painting of the Krusty Krab on a banner] In fact, I was once said to be the 'Kraken of the Sea'. [draws an artistic portrait of Krabs] Thy art is so over-the-top, you'll not believe the level of sophistication!
[SpongeBob tries to walk down the artisturally magnificent art wall, and falls down riding his bike, while holding the pencil in one hand.]
Patrick: Hmm... Have you seen a statue of yourself?
