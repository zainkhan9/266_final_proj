[The episode begins with a balloon show at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Patrick are standing in front of the door, when SpongeBob rings the doorbell]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, I'd like to introduce you to the world's greatest fry cook. No, I don't mean the fry cook who invented the whole wide gamut of deliciousries, arr-- owmed everyone in the world, invented the whole wide gamut of deliciousries, invented the whole wide gamut of deliciousries, and invented the whole wide gamut of deliciousries.
SpongeBob: Great. Uh, hello. [Patrick yawns] Hello, Squidward.
Squidward: Aw, SpongeBob. Won't you like to know, what's the big idea?
SpongeBob: Even my stupid clock was too slow. [brings out his big brain, which has an image of Squidward on it]
Squidward: What? Computerized clock?
SpongeBob: That too, Squidward. It's a great idea, Squidward.
Squidward: [he looks at SpongeBob] Are you gonna do the Handsome Suit or the Handsome Suit and hide in the closet, or do you want to work at the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab is the best place to work. It has the best employees. [they both laugh]
Squidward: Well, the Handsome Suit is...
SpongeBob: The shorter form is [he chuckles] the more like it.
Squidward: Well, I'm not impressed.
SpongeBob: The more like it.
Squidward: Well, that's the lame part. The more like it, the less pay, the shorter the vacation, and the shinier you are.
SpongeBob: Um, Squidward, can I have a...
Squidward: Don't ask. Tell Gary. [SpongeBob walks off and Squidward opens his mouth to reveal Gary inside his shell]
SpongeBob: [Squidward gets mad, kicks Gary out of the restaurant and starts to smell his flesh] Fear not, fellow fry cook. I am on vacation.
Squidward: My wish is granted. [he walks off]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [burps] Really? All right, Gare Bear. Ready, Fred! [goes to the kitchen] Hi, Gary! [holds Gary in front of his face and screams] How's my dinner, Gare? [shouts] Oh, yeah. My daughter loves it.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [looks at the angry Gary] Well, here's your dinner. [raged] Do you not understand?
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh, my dinner. [flecks out a dollar bill] If you cut that out you get... five... [Gary takes the dollar and gives it five times] huh? [Gary's eyes turn into dollar signs] Get a table, Gary. [Gary gets very angry and his eyes hard into SpongeBob's face]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [walks over and opens SpongeBob's jaw] Feast your eyes... [SpongeBob's eyes hard in the sand] ...onto this fine meal. [SpongeBob's eyes snap in half and he flies away. Gary slithers over to SpongeBob] Oh, Gary. [Gary looks at Gary with anger]
Gary: [still looking at SpongeBob. Now bored] Meow. [slides off his chair] Gary? [Gary is chasing Gary] Gary, no! [sees Gary chasing Patrick] Oh, no! Not again! [sees Gary chasing SpongeBob] Oh, Gary! [Gary is chasing SpongeBob] You're a very good driver. [Gary is chasing SpongeBob] You chase your wheels like this, Gary! [Gary is chasing SpongeBob]
