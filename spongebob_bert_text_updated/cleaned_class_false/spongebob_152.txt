Squidward: [In the bathroom, he wipes his face with the hair on his head, then gets out a bowl of shaving cream.] I haven't felt this wet in months. [walks into shower] Hi, how are ya.
Mr. Krabs: Boy, what a nice day.
Squidward: I can't feel my legs.
Mr. Krabs: Aww, that's terrible. I thought you gave me a bad wig.
Squidward: I can feel my legs. [in shower] My regular one.
Mr. Krabs: And you haven't washed your face in weeks.
Squidward: I didn't wait in line.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, want to help?
Squidward: Would you get out of my wig? I made it with less than a humming, 15 second soak. [Squidward whimpers. SpongeBob takes off wig]
SpongeBob: It's time to get our feet on the ground.
Squidward: Huh? [Plankton, wearing a tank top and holding a tank top, stand up] That's pretty ridiculous. [points to his feet. He walks around naked] And I just finished "doing it the old-fashioned way". Me and my old co-worker SpongeBob SquarePants will do the "whatever, whatever" way. [walking down the sidewalk with SpongeBob] And your old co-worker SquarePants will do the "whatever, whatever, whatever". [they pass a sign that says "SquarePants Rest Home".]
Plankton: [reads the sign] "SquarePants Rest Home"? [he sees the sign off-screen and screams] SpongeBob's going to live. Get those keys off his junk! 
SpongeBob: Oh, I have so many things to live for! [laughs. Scene cuts to live-action SpongeBob's and SpongeBob's living room where the pots and pans are covered with their stuff. SpongeBob laughs and has his hands are as clarinets. Then the live-action live-action SpongeBob's house is a few stories high and has a sign that says "Updated" on it. The Krusty Krab sign now reads "Krabby Land".]
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Squidward?
Squidward: And do you come here all the time?
SpongeBob: We!
Squidward: And do you?
SpongeBob: We are a sleepy, little town of depressed people called Krabby Patties.
Squidward: [gasps] I can't believe it!
SpongeBob: We are depressed.
Squidward: Oh, don't be sad, Squidward. We'll be here in a heartbeat.
SpongeBob: We're just here for the old Patty. [Pans up and shows the Krusty Krab that it is not a bomb, it's a bomb that goes off]
Squidward: I lost me house, too. [Takes out a bulldozer, takes the trailer, puts it in the truck and proceeds to demolish it] I'm gonna hang these puny yellow barnacles off! [Throws the trailer against the fence and it plows towards SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: I am so sorry, Squidward. [Scene cuts to the bulldozer destroying the Krusty Krab and everyone outside.]
Squidward: Nobody cares. This destruction will not bring about the apocalypse you- [Looks out of nowhere and sees the trailer full of sludge] So get back here you little scariest! [Goes back into his house. Scene cuts to the trailer where Patrick and Squidward are]
Squidward: So that's what you're really waiting for. [Scene cuts to the trailer where Karen and Mr. Krabs are]
Karen: Wait what?
Karen and Mr. Krabs: So that's when the genie finally showed up. [Scene cuts to the trailer where Patrick is still sleeping and Squidward wakes up]
Squidward: That's not what you thought you could do, you bald egomaniac! [Crying] How could you ever do this many obstacles?
Mr. Krabs: Well, yeah. But I wanted to show him I could make mistakes. So I went right back into it! I created an actor to watch...
SpongeBob: Gee, Mr. Krabs. What do you think of this new twist?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, it's a lot like what I had in my past, you know. You could even ably [Laughs] serve someone their car keys.
SpongeBob: Carry your keys like you're your dad.
