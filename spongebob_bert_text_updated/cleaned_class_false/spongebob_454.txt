[scene transitions to Sandy's treedome]
Sandy: Okay, Patrick, you can go now. You don't even have any hands. We can move that snail around.
Patrick: [hops on his rock and gets on the rockmobile, but his snail slams into the wall] That hurts!
Sandy: That really doesn't hurt! [Sandy gets shocked when she discovered that Patrick wasn't a baby and was actually a snail.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh! Our babies!
Sandy: Yes, it does hurt.
Patrick: Well, what about our... igoo... [falls off the rockmobile and lands in front of Sandy's treedome] ...grandkids?
Sandy: No, they're just people she's having a family time for.
Grandma: [to Sandy] Mom, can I have a... papa? [everyone complains and misses the igoo]
Sandy: Oh, Grandma, papa! [gets grabbed by Sandy] I gotta have something...
Grandma: [to SpongeBob] No, don't eat my food! [everyone complains and misses the igoo. SpongeBob cries]
SpongeBob: Sandy, don't you hear that? [thinking] I've got to have something to eat, or I'm gonna have a snail! [SpongeBob then has a snail and it slams into Sandy's treedome, she screams]
Sandy: [to Grandma] Please, don't do that! [Grandma looks in surprise. As she thinks, SpongeBob comes out of the tree and holds an ice cream cone]
SpongeBob: I have to have something to eat, Grandma! [SpongeBob pops out of the ice cream cone] Sorry, Grandma! Uh, Grandma, uh, I don't like to talk about... my boyfriends pictures. [sees pictures but sees only pictures of him and Patrick] Oh! I can't have that! [takes the picture, and it got taken. His sperm shoots out of it] I'll never be able to have a baby!
Sandy: Don't tell anyone.
SpongeBob: I'll just have to live without him. [both hug]
Sandy: Ew. [gets stepped on by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Sandy, I'll handle anything.
Sandy: Okay. [takes SpongeBob's hand]
SpongeBob: Thanks for the baby, Sandy.
Sandy: Don't mention it. [both walk off]
SpongeBob: Okay, Sandy. [wishes the sperm some more]
Sandy: Eeww. [walks up to SpongeBob with a cow's head] SpongeBob, howdy, howdy, and howey, howdy.
SpongeBob: Hello, Sandy. [Sandy sees SpongeBob standing in front of a bride]
Bride: What should I do?
Sandy: Don't forget your clothes. [Sandy comes out of the groom and starts to groom her groom, but a horse neighs] Oh, dear! Not again!
Bride: Come still. [the horse neighs] Oh, dear. Let's go.
Sandy: Whew, I hope not.
SpongeBob: Oh, dear Neptune. Let's go.
Sandy: Whew, I hope not.
SpongeBob: Oh, dear Neptune. Let's go.
Sandy: Whew, I hope not.
SpongeBob: Oh, dear Neptune. Let's go.
[The groom then kicks SpongeBob and him off his feet. The groom then kicks SpongeBob and him off his feet. The screen shakes. The screen then shakes.]
Ivy: [while eating marshmallows] What's that on your feet?
SpongeBob: Oh, that! [TV shows a bunch of tourists on a seahorse riding a seahorse, laughing, happily, and riding on a seahorse's tail] Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!
Ivy: Eating a marshmallow, sir!
SpongeBob: Oh, that's right, Pretty Patty, you're in luck now! [SpongeBob pops out of the marshmallow and onto the TV as the groom twirls]
Tiffany: You're in luck, Trophy Larry. This year's Boating School Talent Show tonight.
SpongeBob: Good night, Trophy.
Tiffany: I need a hotel room. [The TV blinks a few times with a red light from it] Where is this impostor?
[SpongeBob slides down the screen]
SpongeBob: Tonight's Talent Show. I'm the most wanted man in Bikini Bottom.
