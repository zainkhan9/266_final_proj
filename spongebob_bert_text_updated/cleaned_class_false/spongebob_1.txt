[At night, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are spying on each other through their portable night lights.]
SpongeBob: [singing] Sponge-Booo-Booo-Bo-Booo, Sponge-Booo-Booo-Booo! [They sleep in a huge bed.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you can sleep in, under this ooze. [He pulls off a sheet] But why don't you sleep in my night light? [He turns on a night light, and it attracts all the night light. He slides off the bed and goes to sleep, but the bed was too soft.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I sure do want to sleep under this ooze of night light.
[SpongeBob pulls down the night light's lid, but Tom falls out of the night light onto the bottom.]
Tom: Mom! [He pulls himself back up, and SpongeBob overhears the overheating part of the night light.] It's not really night light. It's "overly-hot."
SpongeBob: Overly-hot? I don't think I'm gonna get any sleepovers. Anybody can be too... [He tries to get rid of the night light, but ends up getting nothing as he rubbed his armpits] â€¦too... [As he rubs his armpit. Eventually, night light turns into a light and a cart comes straight to SpongeBob's house.] I can finally sleep. [SpongeBob opens the door, and starts to get up with Gary sleeping in his bed, but the light turned into steam byproducts and he falls asleep. SpongeBob puts the box on the rack and Gary goes to sleep. He snores and puts his head in the box and it shuts.] What's going on? [SpongeBob gets completely waked and starts waltzed in front of Patrick. Patrick is growling inside his house.] SpongeBob! [He spots Patrick] What are you doing!? [Patrick is standing over SpongeBob and his box]
Patrick: I couldn't be in armpit pants this instant!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, you've got the right idea. [He pulls down the night light, and it turns into the shape of money. Then, he puts his head in the box and it closes]
Patrick: You got it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [As Patrick gets angry, he throws the box and the money behind him into the kitchen and cooks them on the grill and prepares some other things] I get those under there, too. Hmm... [He takes a pan and pours a plate of ketchup and mustard under it. Then he pans out two patties, one on a plate, and one on the wall. Then he places the meat on the wall and the sign says "Free!"] He gets the idea here. [Patrick eats the ketchup and mustard and goes outside to put on the ketchup.]
Patrick: Huh? [Squidward is napping in my room on his recliner with a television on set. The background is of tomatoes and octopus. SpongeBob appears to be sleeping and Squidward is on top of the bottle of ketchup he is holding with his head.]
Squidward: What's wrong, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Squidward said he was going to sleep over comin.
Squidward: [shivering] Would you let a little booth business go to waste?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I was just trying to sleep.
Squidward: It was a free booth! You're charging me for a part of the work I don't need!
SpongeBob: Oh, don't feel wrong.
Patrick: Good night, Mr. Tentacles. [They fall out of the box and Squidward wakes up.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you paid me to break these back windows. Why are we having this little bit of a battle?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Well, if it's any good, you might as well blame me.
Squidward: Maybe Squilliam would've used a little bit of marketing to sell you this idea.
SpongeBob: Yeah, that sounds right. [He does a little dance]
Squidward: Do you have any stinkins for Patrick? [Patrick is listening from out of the closet. He smells something and then smells some more] He smells... delicious! [laughs evilly as he walks out of the scene]
SpongeBob: Oh, I smell nothing! Gasp! I don't know what would make you feel better, Patrick?
Patrick: No, oh, you don't. I was just wondering.
