SpongeBob: Good morning, Krusty Krab! 
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need your help with an emergency formula. 
SpongeBob: Whoa! 
Squidward: This is a disasterous order! Here's the emergency! [Notices box] Wait for me, SpongeBob! [Cries as a bowl of ice cubes falls on his head] Ow! 
SpongeBob: [Appears with ice cubes on his head] Hello, Squidward! 
Squidward: SpongeBob, what emergency formula is out there? 
SpongeBob: This one. 
Squidward: Yeah, that one. 
SpongeBob: [Wormy oozes green green green goo from his body] Ok, get it, Squidward. Good as new. Get it? [Looks in the mirror and SpongeBob is seen with blue rings around his eyes and his nose sticking out from his head, a golf ball sticking out of his eye, an umbrella from another island and a bicycle from the back of his head] Ok, now this is a dream.me. [Goes to get the calendar and puts it on the calendar. SpongeBob gets a call from his boss at the Krusty Krab] [to his boss] Mr. Krabs, [to himself] Just cutting costs me a fortune.
Mr. Krabs: [Eyes turn into dollar signs] That's not true. I said I'm gonna cover for you by printing money and printing stuff.
Squidward: [Eats the newspaper as he is talking to himself] I think printing stuff costs me money.
Mr. Krabs: [Stupidly]Yeah, stupidly. You're gonna pay us money.
Squidward: We're not paying you.
Mr. Krabs: No, seriously. We're notpaying you. [Laughs]
SpongeBob: Ahem. [Comes back with more papers] Squidward? Well, if you're so desperate, I guess you can buy one! [Mr. Krabs gets very angry]
Squidward: Why can't I buy one? [Comes back with more papers] I have papers to buy, too! [Both start chewing on them]
SpongeBob: [Comes back with more papers] How do we know which one's costing ya?
Squidward: [Looks at the Mr. Krabs papers] This is one big lie! [Comes back with more papers] Well, if you want what, then what's the point?
SpongeBob: Well, I'll never find me way of looking for it, Squidward. [Holds up more papers] But if you want what, then what's the point?
Squidward: I can see... [Pulls his head out of the papers] I have it all wrong. I can't have bad things happen to me. I look good enough to have good things happen to me.
SpongeBob: Good enough?
Squidward: You said you were gonna cover for his stupid "Stinky Contract" and I was gonna cover for you by hiding in the navy.
SpongeBob: You mean by hiding?
Squidward: [Looks at the papers] Well, if you're gonna hide?
SpongeBob: I hide what?
[A police motorcycle stops next to Squidward and SpongeBob]
Police Officer: We found a Mr. SquarePants and he was gonna pay us to let you in, mister!
Mr. SquarePants: What the...? SpongeBob, you got under my there, officer! [SpongeBob runs away]
Police Officer: What's all the racket?
Squidward: [Frightened] What's racket?!
SpongeBob: [Knock on door] Mr. Squidward!?
Squidward: Who is this?
SpongeBob: It's me, SpongeBob.
Squidward: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What's going on in here!?
Squidward: It's me, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What's going on in here!?
Squidward: Help!
SpongeBob: I'm being held here against my will-- help!
Squidward: Why would they want to charge me with a crime? If I go to the gallows, I'll get a couple of frilly times. [Takes off his pants and jumps in the boatwash papers] They'll think we're softening up this soil with acid.
SpongeBob: [Knocks on the door] Mr. Krabs, I need help!
