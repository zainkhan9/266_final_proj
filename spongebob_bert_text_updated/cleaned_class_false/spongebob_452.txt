SpongeBob: Morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't just stand around waiting for hungry people to show up... Hey, hoo-haa! You've got to be kidding!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, I've got a proposition for you. Follow me.
Mr. Krabs: What do we do now, Squidward?

[Writing starts and everything is already written up]
Squidward: What should we do today, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: [gets hit in the face by writing mat] My pillow is falling on top of me.
Squidward: That's better.
[Cuts to outside of Bikini Bottom]

[Reading a magazine]
Squidward: It's "The Sunday Morning Papers".
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs reading]
Mr. Krabs: "The Sunday Morning Papers"! It's all free, and free to read!
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs, and thanks for reading. If you don't mind, Squidward. Who in turn, doesn't mind. [Holds up paper with contract on it saying "CLOSED" and putting on paper saying "CLOSED SPAIN"]
Squidward: That's what I would call a competent response to your paper. [Turns paper on paper on Sunday]
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, you already closed that bridge. [Takes paper out of paper throwing spatula]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm, I don't know how I...
[Cuts to Squidward house]
Squidward: I'm worried.
Mr. Krabs: All right, Squidward, put the papers out. [Holds up napkins) What's the problem here? [Looks at a sheet of paper] Hmm, have you seen a graveyard?

Mr. Krabs: What's that smell?
Squidward: That Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: That smells like slop.
SpongeBob: Well, I don't know why you think I smell Krabs, but I think I smell his nose.
[Cave Voice: Darts]
Mr. Krabs: All right, boys, let's throw out that garbage. [throws trash out into the kitchen] It's not worth it! They're money! Money that could really help us. [enters kitchen] What do you two think we're worth, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Money?
Squidward: Hmm, let's put it this way. They're my two cents.
Mr. Krabs: My two cents?
Squidward: Two that we can talk to.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I think that in coming days I'll be reporting on this great lawman like his-his-her. [SpongeBob and Squidward walk into "The Krusty Krab"]

Mr. Krabs: What's going on out here?
SpongeBob: There you are, Mr. Krabs. I was looking for that Krabs guy.
Mr. Krabs: I didn't?
SpongeBob: Wha...
