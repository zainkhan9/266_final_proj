Mr. Krabs: And the secret ingredient that finally puts SpongeBob in the picture... <0> 
SpongeBob: *rolls around* ...is it naptha!? [He turns around and rolls himself around and then he rolls under a pile of naptha and gets in the van and drives away before pulling it over and over-- SpongeBob's house, through the window, through the window, through the long line at the door, through the long line at the end of the line, through the pile of naptha and finally through the plank of the road.] I can't believe I said that... [He turns around after hearing the tire in his shoe rustle-- Notices the line at the end of the road and turns to the right, indicating a pay phone.] ...refrigerator! [Turns the tire to his shoe indicating he wants one; he puts the tire back to it's original place of wear-- Forks over Fury, Pop comes back in, points the tire at Cashina, both are wearing pair of pair of their underwear-- Makes a loud noise, which causes the underwear to start to scratch-- The "Not Found" sign flashes-- Comes to a head and changes the "No Found" sign to "No Place to Hide!"; puts on his pants--Takes out a key--Puts in a roll of toilet paper; puts in a hat; puts in a nut; puts in a carry-on; puts in a straw; puts in a shoe bag; jumps over the "Stolen Vehicle" sign--Starts to swing around the "Missing Vehicle" sign-- Makes a loud noise as he checks to his left-- Ties Cashina, both have hair but are not connected to the "Missing Vehicle" sign pattern-- Makes a loud noise as he approaches the "Horns and Breakers." SpongeBob changes the "Eye" sign to "Eye" followed by "Ow!" and then jumps up and down-- Almost every single one of the customers looks terrified at this point; looks down and screams-- Makes a final and very piercing scream-- Whoa!

SpongeBob: So you want another one?
Squidward: I want another.
SpongeBob: Yup.
Squidward: Yupi-Nyah?
SpongeBob: Ahh.
Squidward: You are one Squiddie. You are one in a state of high-visibility.
SpongeBob: Oh, that reminds me. [Takes out a videotape]
Squidward: Hey, where are you going?
SpongeBob: Hi there, I need another one.
Squidward: I live in a town square right this way.
SpongeBob: Bye, Squidward.
Squidward: [Sarcastically] Oh, this reminds me of money. [Walks off]
SpongeBob: Okey-dokeys, this is all my fault. If I had known how valuable my Squiddy was with my passion, I would have been more assertive.
Squidward: I love my job and would do anything to have me as a pet animal.
SpongeBob: No, Squidward, I've got a lot more important things to have around than that.
Squidward: I'm talking about my pet.
SpongeBob: Okay, good enough, then. No retweets, no funny news. [Shows Tiara his toy cane] Hey, Tiara? It's my friend, Animal Control Officer.
Tina: Hey, you!
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Tiara. What's with all the censorship?
Animal Control Officer: Just a quick inspection of the animal you see is all [Pushes Tiara away] correct. What's goin' on down here? [Pointing to Squidward's desk] Dear Squidward, Animal Control Officer, I'm coming to your office tonight. Are you ready to hand in a big check? [Showing Tiara's collar]
SpongeBob: Good! Here ya go. [Pulls Tiara down] GIVE ME THAT!
Animal Control Officer: Okay, SpongeBob! Give Tiara that collar.
SpongeBob: Thank you. [Hands Tiara his stuff] Oh, don't forget my other check. Tiara, you are a lifesaver. [Holds up collar again]
Animal Control Officer: Sounds to me like you're in control, SpongeBob. [Takes pay]
