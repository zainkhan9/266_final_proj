[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick skipping down the path with a "Walk the Puff" activity. They start by walking up to a pickle net.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Puff! [screams] Puff!
Patrick: [screams] Never!
[The episode ends with the words "RAW!"]
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is terrible!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: This is terrible! To get away from, I'm afraid, your pal Sabine...
Patrick: Yeah, I know. You want to go pet-nap? No? Fine, if you don't mind, I'll just come right up with a different idea! [walks away]
Patrick: Pet-nap? What is that?
[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket. The path behind Patrick changes into the water ending.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Where is everybody?!?! [screams] I'm scared! I can't take it!
[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket doors. Patrick, Sandy, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, and the Empty Boat are shown.]
Patrick: Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Hurry up!
Patrick: I'm sorry. Wait, what's this?
SpongeBob: It's a sign that Puff Urchin wrote.
Patrick: Oh! I wonder what that is, looks... [He reads the writing on the typewriter, and laughs maniacally. SpongeBob peaks his eyestalk out to see the writing on Patrick's desk. Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, and Squidward are shown.] ...a. Give a brief explanation of what you're doing wrong]
Sandy: Uh, you're still on vacation, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: And you wrote—
SpongeBob: Huh?
Sandy: "Don't worry, Mr. Krabs! I'm not much of a fry cook, and I know what lazy as you are! And don't panic, I'll do it any day!"
[The scene shows SpongeBob in his house. He has a rock, a record player, a record player, and a microphone.]
SpongeBob: Oh, here we go again. [He hums an upbeat note. He yawns. He shows his hand. He takes out a pink blanket.] It's been a while, I feel lazy.
[SpongeBob starts to tear up.]
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs, that's not a blanket I want you to wear. That's my friend, who I am fond of calling Mr. Touchy-touchy— [He whispers into his ear. He shows his ear, then moves his body] And he has his own TV channel that he can air on.
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's house. He wrings from above as his body gets bigger. He climbs some stairs, then jumps onto some stairs and uses the tv to get some news. He uses the light switch to open and close the door, then jumps out. He climbs upstairs, and closes the hole left behind him by dropping the empty box on the floor.]
SpongeBob: La la la!
[SpongeBob sighs. He starts to go upstairs. He grabs some supplies from the pile, then takes a barrel and accidentally hits the wall. He then throws the barrel on the ground and chomps on it. He goes over to the window, and sets the tv on. He then uses the sound function on the TV to get the TV's color. He laughs, then goes to the phone.]
Sandy: Just dial number and get the... Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Spica-long for Spongy Road. [She snatches it, smiles, then laughs] Spongy Road. [The pineapple collapses, then SpongeBob takes off his blanket, then SpongeBob takes off his pair of shoes, and finally he pulls out a torn shirt] My pantaloons. [He grabs the shirt and sees the onescha] Woohoo! My beloved Krusty Krab! [He takes the shirt and goes to leave, but Patrick kicks him out of the restaurant. Later, the same people walk up]
Mrs. Puff: I'll never forget that day. I was with Krusty Krab... how could I have missed the first day of business fair?
Larry: [While walking through the park] The First day of fair play! You are what you are, old boy. You make the Krusty Krab all better!
Sandals: You are what you are, old boy.
