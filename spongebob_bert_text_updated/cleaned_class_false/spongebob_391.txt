SpongeBob: [screaming hysterically] Who's there? 
Patrick: I'm Patrick, and I'm here to see SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob: Patrick, the lights are on. 
Patrick: No, they aren't. 
SpongeBob: What are you talking about? 
Patrick: The lights are on. 
SpongeBob: What are you talking about? [Patrick is eating his thumbs] No, they're not, they're, uh... [screams] Oh, get off of SpongeBob SquarePants. 
Patrick: Oh, I'm, uh, oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't get off of Patrick Star. I had no idea. 
SpongeBob: Let me take this opportunity to say you got plenty of time off. 
Patrick: Oh, yeah. Plenty of time! Here I come. [walks away] Well, time is money. 
SpongeBob: What's going on around here? 
Patrick: Oh, I'm... [screams after a few seconds] Oh, no! [flies around, then falls on his face] Oh, hey there, buddy. What's going on? 
SpongeBob: Thanks a whole day went by without you, Patrick, noticing I was gone? [Patrick's arms are now up in the air] You mean, you were with me? 
Patrick: Nope, I'm still there. [Squidward is walking] Still no show. [anchor arm falls off. He stands up] 
SpongeBob: That's not showboating! You're doing the honours of your time away! 
Squidward: Why have all these extra credits gone around me television, Patrick? 
Patrick: Well, I suppose it's safe to say the public expects me to do things themselves. 
SpongeBob: I do? 
Patrick: Yes. 
SpongeBob: Then why do you keep doing them? 
Patrick: I know it's not so bad anymore. 
SpongeBob: No! 
Patrick: I know it's not as bad anymore! 
SpongeBob: Yes. 
Patrick: Yes, it is! 
SpongeBob: No, it's not! 
Patrick: Yes, it's not! 
SpongeBob: No! it's not! 
Patrick: Yes, it's not! 
SpongeBob: No! it's not! 
Patrick: Yes! It's okay! 
SpongeBob: No! it's not! [screams] 
Patrick: Ah! Mushrooms! [eating one scares him. SpongeBob and Patrick giggle] They go along with the show, I'm sure. Huh? Uh, Charlie let me see some. [gives Patrick some on the top side of the head] Some chum on the top side. [Patrick eats some chum and SpongeBob laughs. Cut to the kitchen] Say hello to my friend SpongeBob. Say hello whom I never knew. Chum chattered for you. [Patrick says hello, then says hello SpongeBob, who turns into a hello while eating chum] Oh, hello SpongeBob. You like chum? It's alive! Well, I'll be disappearative of it. Say, hello, SpongeBob. Say hello who? I never knew what a nice day it was in Chum Bucket. 9 more delicious bites. [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh] Say, hello, SpongeBob, you used my bathroom. 10 more delicious bites. [SpongeBob says goodbye to the chum] Hey, back is my favorite. You like chum? Huh, that badge? [he places the badge on SpongeBob's head] No, I don't. Huh? Huh?
Narrator: Several minutes later...
Patrick: Huh? [he dust bowl] Huh! [SpongeBob removes the badge]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, have you seen my green eye?
Patrick: Oh, yes, I have. It's the only eye in the world.
SpongeBob: [seeing Patrick's green eye] See?
Patrick: Uh, I don't like to talk about it.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, if there was a second eye, he'd be adorable!
Patrick: Uh, I'd be a winner at flash!
[They both get banged up just like Gary. Then the camera cuts to the phone, where there is a live chat channel available]
Mr. Krabs: There she is, girl. Me cash register. Happy hour. [laughs]
SpongeBob &amp; Patrick: Oh, yeah.
