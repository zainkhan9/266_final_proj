[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is once again busy making a riot of the Krusty Krab merchandise causing crime.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... So Mr. Squidward's gonna have to clean this place up, huh? Hmm... Well, I guess it's safe to say that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[SpongeBob and Squidward are still having customers. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is about to close the Krusty Krab but then he stops hear a honking noise.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I've got to say that, SpongeBob. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Oh, thank you, thank you! Thank you, thank you! Thank you, thank you! [then a creepy hand comes running over and takes part in Mr. Krabs' dirty laundry] Uh, Mr. Krabs, there's a couple of new customers.
SpongeBob: [salutes, then bows] Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob... what the...?! SpongeBob, don't you know that's a fake? Oh, those Krabby Patties aren't fake! [throws them to the crowd, causing them to attack SpongeBob]
Plankton: [throwing them towards Squidward] Enough! You're nothing but a rowdy rabble, a rabble and brawls!
Squidward: [begging, also] Can I get some ketchup?
Plankton: Yes. [knocks on Squidward's wooden door]
Squidward: And the door shuts.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! [knocks on the door again] Why do you keep doing this, SpongeBob?
Squidward: Every time, I bring out my pickle barrel to taste your flesh and blood.
Mr. Krabs: Nah. Leave that to the experts.
Squidward: You're just gonna have to go up there and wash those tables of yours, are ya?
Plankton: No. I'm just here to apply the rules. [slams his feet onto the floor]
Squidward: Oh, my pickles. [picksles and rubs the pickles and rubles then puts his pickles on the taste test bench]
Mr. Krabs: "Ridding" a customer of his pickle is one thing.
Plankton: [slamming his feet onto the floor again]
Squidward: Oh, my pickles. [sings]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, my pickles. [sings]
Plankton: [sings]
Squidward: Oh, my pickles. [sings]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, my pickles. [sings]
Plankton: Oh, my pickles. [sings]
Squidward: [breathes heavily and shrugs his shoulders]
Mr. Krabs: [spins his arms like a speedo] Oh, my pickles. [stretches his legs out and rolls with the force of his accident] Why don't you lay off the fast food you love?
