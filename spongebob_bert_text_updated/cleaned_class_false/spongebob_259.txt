Mr. Krabs: Hm, I got you covered. [rubs his hand all over Liliana]
Liliana: Thanks. [rubs his other hand all over Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [grossed out] ugh! [smacks his face everywhere] Huh? [puts his hand to his mouth] This is serious, boy. I've got to get this man out of this mess. [whispers] You know what she's talking about. I'm gonna be tired, sweet as a sea star.
