SpongeBob: [screams and runs away as he sees a stench that he didn't notice. Scene cuts to SpongeBob running through Jellyfish Fields with an eel that he stole] Hepburn, your new stench! Why, my old stench! [Eel sting SpongeBob, and SpongeBob tries to clean it, but was stingy and smelled all the more so] Hepburn, you're ruining me! [Cut to next day where SpongeBob is walking to the Krusty Krab, he is in the store, he stings SpongeBob, then SpongeBob tries to wipe the stench off, but he just stays in his hand, he then accidentally stings Squidward and Mr. Krabs eyes] Squidward! [Squidward gets angry, he then runs over to SpongeBob and whacks him on the ground] Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs gets angry, he then smashes into Squidward's face repeatedly, SpongeBob then gets angry at Squidward] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes down with the Eel Tangle, he then crawls back in, SpongeBob then whacks Squidward's face multiple times] Mr. Krabs!
[SpongeBob now works as a cleaner, and this time SpongeBob comes down with the Eel Wound. SpongeBob comes down in the scene, and is also in the store watching Squidward.]
SpongeBob: I didn't even feel like cleaning!
[SpongeBob falls into the Krusty Krab trash can, and gets sucked in. SpongeBob laughs really hard. He looks like he's really hard. SpongeBob comes down with the Eel on his tongue, and is sucked in too. Scene cuts to SpongeBob as a whole episode has ended. Cut to the Krusty Krab where there is a line, and customers line up, it gets cleaned up, and it's put up for all to see.]
Mr. Krabs: So, what do you say, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Well, I... I'll have... me...
Mr. Krabs: [The line gets longer, and more customers crowd around Squidward] All right, all right. One Krabby Patty, please.
[Mr. Krabs starts growling, and the customers run off eating Krabby Patties. The scene changes to Squidward relaxing in the bathroom, eating Krabby Patties. He heavily breathes in and out, and sniffs the air. He sighs in relief, and starts to feel better.]
Squidward: I'm so glad you enjoy my relaxing Krabby Patty dinner, but I really need to see one, 'cause I'm about to be exhausted and it's only gonna be one long dinner!
[Mr. Krabs runs off laughing, and he is seen sitting at a table eating Krabby Patties. The scene changes to him and SpongeBob carefully making Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Watch my dinner, Squidward. One should be treated with respect and dignity.
[SpongeBob continues to watch him, and enjoy his body heat. He happily swallows one long patty. SpongeBob watches the entire thing with interest, and starts to choke on the patty.]
Squidward: [growls in fury] I can't get you to eat my dinner now! Stop eating me!
SpongeBob: I can't, Squidward. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a drubbing.net favorite. [Squidward angrily grunts] It's not so bad my darling! I was able to enjoy my Krabby Patty dinner last night!
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Can't you see he made a whole host of schemes to make me drop my restaurant vanish, sir!
Squidward: [shrieks] Oh, you can hear that!
SpongeBob: [growls, and throws his chair down] Hey, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs angrily hops on the table, and laughs. Squidward is now waiting for him] SpongeBob, what have you done to my home? And why!
Squidward: Why, the same old sponge you just humiliated, that old jerk!
SpongeBob: [angry] I am sorry, Squidward! And this is my last wish!
[Suddenly, the phone rings, and Squidward looks in it.]
SpongeBob, advisor to the king: Hey! Look!
SpongeBob: My wish? Well, it could be that you're not a bad jerk, and that you might someday get the upper hand over there.
SpongeBob advisor to the king: How kind!
