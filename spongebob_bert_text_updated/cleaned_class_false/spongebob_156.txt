Squidward: Well, I hope you made it or not, SpongeBob. That last one's gonna leave a mark.
SpongeBob: I did?
Squidward: Now you're saying I left a mark.
SpongeBob: Well, you made it... [straightens his pencil out] no matter what... [points to scribble in the sand] or what... [straightens his pencil out]
Squidward: I almost wish I had.
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you don't have to. We can pick up our own free will.
Squidward: No, I don't have it.
SpongeBob: Okay, see ya around 'til tomorrow. [at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob knocks on the door with a patty]
Squidward: SpongeBob, come in.
SpongeBob: Patty, can I have a Krabby Patty?
Squidward: SpongeBob, can I have one too, silly?
SpongeBob: Sure. [knocks on door]
Squidward: SpongeBob, what do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob: I've gone hours without a patty and it looks better than it ever did before.
Squidward: Good thinking, SpongeBob. I'll show you a trick.
SpongeBob: What's a trick?
Squidward: Just ask Gary.
SpongeBob: I know, Gary. [holds up his spatula] When you knock, one tiny patty comes off and out right away. [inhales, makes a weird noise]
Gary's: [giggles] Potty, you're missing something, huh?
SpongeBob: Yeah, I know. [laughs] You never really left until you knocked on my door, Squiddy.
Squidward: [sighs] Guess I'm being too hard on the Krusty Krab. [knocks on door again]
SpongeBob: Did you get the formula already? [SpongeBob knocks on it and comes out again] Oh, I get it already!
Squidward: Why don't you just knock and ask me for the formula?
SpongeBob: I can't. I have a whole week to get the formula before tomorrow.
Squidward: Oh, really? [bangs his fists on the door bell]
SpongeBob: Yeah-o. [knocks on door again]
Squidward: Oh, don't be silly! I've got to get back to work. [knocks on door again]
SpongeBob: D'oh, I can't, Squidward. I knocked on my door too long.
Squidward: Well, here goes... [looks at his watch] Maybe I should go out of my way to... [his fists come off the door]
SpongeBob: [appears in a suit] What are you doing here?
Squidward: Just going to get some work done. [appears in a suit, too-so-hilt-like-it's-named] You're suppose to wear your work hat in work and at home, then it's out of the way if I'm not late for work.
SpongeBob: But, but, I just wanted to knock on the door.
Squidward: Why do you knock?
SpongeBob: Sometimes I just need to be friendly.
Squidward: Ha, ha, it's just my old boss SquarePants. Heh.
SpongeBob: Um, err...will you mind bustin' me open?
Squidward: Why, yes, I will, if you'll do the trick. [SpongeBob knocks on the door again]
SpongeBob: Order open.
Squidward: That I cannot hear.
SpongeBob: [off-screen] That's not the trick! The order is open.
Squidward: Well, you've just one minute to get me out of here! Hear that, Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: The trick is very simple, Squiddy. The sooner you get the formula the better.
Squidward: That is?
SpongeBob: Don't forget the opener.
Squidward: I got it, don't you? [Opens door and talks in a high-pitched voice] Get it?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squiddy, I know what you're thinking. Why won't you just give in? We'll show you how the tough talk class works. Who's in the good graces of Squidward?
