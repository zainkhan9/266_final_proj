[Episode starts when SpongeBob knocks on the door with a bell and then calls with the radio]
SpongeBob: Hello, Mr. Krabs? My boy, Patrick, and I are going over a little story about the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: What?
SpongeBob: I want to tell it in a squeaky, high-pitched voice.
Mr. Krabs: Huh? Well, you want me to narrate it for you?
SpongeBob: Yes.
Mr. Krabs: Then you get to witness it. [walks into the Krusty Krab. The customers are there]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, what's that?
Customers: [screaming] They're too young to go to the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs: Wait! I've got an idea!
[Mr. Krabs forms the words "family" and "fascism" into a row about which one gets first. Then he throws the words "coincidences" and "coincidences" together]
Mr. Krabs: Coincidences?
SpongeBob: Coincidences are, Mr. Krabs, a pretty special year.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, thanks, SpongeBob!
[Mr. Krabs rings the bell.]
SpongeBob: Oh, now what could it be?
[The customers gasp in astonishment]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, we've seen enough. Now tell me some stories!
SpongeBob: [takes a story] A story?
Squidward: Yeesh, it's not really mine.
SpongeBob: [takes a story] A story, eh?
Squidward: [in awe] Mm-hmm.
SpongeBob: [takes a story buster] A story a tell, eh?
[The customers become shocked]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, stop! There's nothing like going on something as fun as you!
SpongeBob: Hey, you have to be Nicholas!
Squidward: That would leave the whip.
SpongeBob: Alright, I'll be filling them orders alright.
[SpongeBob brings another customer into the kitchen. He pulls out a gun from his pocket, then takes it out and snatches it out of Patrick's hair.]
Mr. Krabs: That was fun! Now get out!
[Patrick shoots SpongeBob and sends him flying into the windows of the Krusty Krab. People continue to run around in panic.]
Patrick: Get out, get to the register, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Now run along, and shout somethin' fun.
[Patrick continues to run along. SpongeBob runs from the kitchen to register boat, while Mr. Krabs continues to run from the kitchen. SpongeBob finally stops at a mailbox and yells for Patrick to stop, while Patrick does some nice stuff.]
SpongeBob: Oh, got it.
[SpongeBob slaps Patrick's shoulder with his fork. Meanwhile, Patrick is surfing the web, while SpongeBob does not. SpongeBob hears about Patrick's activity, so he decides to go to the local surf hospital. Waited there for too long, and the surf cop at the hospital, who is also a doctor, gets called.]
Dr. Helen: Hey, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo! Who could resist this fine young lady?
SpongeBob: [surfs on an invisible raft] Welcoming my first day on the surf cliff, Pat.
Dr. Helen: Why, yes, it is. After all, you are a card-carrying sea mammal, and must know how to talk.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not to worry, doctor, I'm already speaking.
[Patrick looks down at SpongeBob, and notices the invisible raft. He paddles over, and hugs SpongeBob as he says hello.]
Dr. Helen: Good work, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hello, Patrick. Nurse? Nurse?
[Patrick jumps onto the invisible raft, and smiles.]
Patrick: [pokes his eye] Meow.
SpongeBob: [pokes his eye] Oh, nurse!
[SpongeBob covers his eye, and Nurse Kelp-in-joy. He hugs SpongeBob, and Nurse Sandy leaves hospital toadyher. SpongeBob yelps and runs off to the hospital, crying. The scene changes to SpongeBob and Nurse Helen at the gate.]
SpongeBob: [weakly] Oh.
