[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab back on the moon.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No! Not the moon! [shudder] The precious jewel of the Krabby Patty! The hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!
[Suddenly, the moon starts to crack. Mr. Krabs screams in panic, and the moon continues to crack as well. The clams swirl around Mr. Krabs in terror. The clams bring the bulldozer up to the moon, and start to drive it away. The bulldozer breaks through the Krusty Krab back to the moon.]
Mr. Krabs: Stop! Don't go! [The scene returns to the bulldozer, who is sitting in its position] How are we going to get that rare, rare, hairpin for free?! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Rare hairpin!
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's an order! And I just want your hairpin. [The scene returns to the bulldozer, who is sitting in its its original position]
Truck Driver: Hairpin avail: [holding the hairpin] Hairpin. [holding it is now fresh]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, hold it back. You're nothing but a hairpin. Now, I'll just take that hairpin and scalp it away!
SpongeBob: [In terror, SpongeBob walks over with the hairpin] Okay, back to the drawing board. [The scene returns to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Don't cry, SpongeBob. I've already drawn your hair!
SpongeBob: Hi. [The scene returns to Mr. Krabs] Ok, back to the drawing board. [SpongeBob jumps in the air and hugs Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Take it away, SpongeBob!
[The scene returns to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: It's not the hair, it's the warmth.
Mr. Krabs: What's that, ghost?
SpongeBob: I couldn't find that hair, it was just a tall order.
Mr. Krabs: It's ahi, boy. Take it, take it! Take it back!
SpongeBob: It's not the hair, it's the warmth!
Mr. Krabs: Ha—ha, take it or leave it—oh, it's getting late.
SpongeBob: late, late, late. Okay, Mr. Krabs. Late again. [The scene returns to Mr. Krabs.] I still don't know.
[Mr. Krabs is shown using a metal detector to look for what is Bleach, a hair pin. SpongeBob passes by it several times.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hey, SpongeBob. SpongeBob! SpongeBob! You look okay. Hey, what's the problem?
SpongeBob: [While using his eyes as a nose shaker] You look fine.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, look again. HUH?!?! Why, SpongeBob? What's the problem?
SpongeBob: I believe it's...
Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute, SpongeBob, you're asking the answer to a very important question. Is it time for some tea?
[As SpongeBob is finishing up, a female customer walks up and buys some tea. She then puts her tea in SpongeBob's bowl.]
Mr. Krabs: One Krabby Patty!
[SpongeBob continues to look for the Female Customer and no one is looking.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, that's not the one. [The scene returns to SpongeBob.] I'm missing something very important. Something that's probably almost certainly: "This food is better than this."
Female customer: Oh, that's very good, SpongeBob. How can this be?
SpongeBob: You know, my friend Sandy, [SpongeBob starts looking through the kitchen window of his house in amazement] it's the only living farm in the whole world!
[SpongeBob looks out from the kitchen window, where he sees Mrs. Puff, The Bikini Bottom News, and the outside of the Krusty Krab, laughing.]
Sandy: Not to worry, SpongeBob. I have plenty of tea."
SpongeBob: [While Sandy is laughing] Oh, dear! This is the best aww!
[SpongeBob digs in his bag and finds a tea bag. He starts to take his tea and finds out that SpongeBob changed his locks, causing him to blow all of his bubbles out]
SpongeBob: This sure is the best day for a day!
