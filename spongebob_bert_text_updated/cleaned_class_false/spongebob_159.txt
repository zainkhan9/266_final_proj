[The episode starts with Gary watching TV. The TV starts to move as Jimmy eats cereal, Tom is sucking some lemonade at the Krusty Krab, and SpongeBob is gardening while SpongeBob looks kinda upset.]
SpongeBob: Nope. [enters the kitchen] Nope. [enters the kitchen again] Nope.
[SpongeBob notices Patrick and Squidward entering the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Hey guys.
Squidward: Oh, hey guys. Hello, are you guys coming over for a... [clears throat] Is it lunch or tea?
SpongeBob: Uh, uh, hello.
Squidward: How are you guys getting [pulls out their lunch notices] tea?
SpongeBob: Uh, we're both beginners, huh?
Squidward: I'm gonna start with our traditional [gets out of his rock] open kitchen.est.
SpongeBob: Okay. Your welcome.
Patrick: Are you ready for our [gulps in and out of rock] welcome party?
SpongeBob: The party, yeah. Our first event...
Squidward: Welcome... what's that?
SpongeBob: It's our 21st anniversary. And we [climbs through the rock]ha, welcome to our [gulps out from inside] first [gulps out of the rock]birth anniversary. Are you ready?
Patrick: Yes.
Squidward: Welcome. [gulps out]
SpongeBob: It's your birthday!
Squidward: No, it's not your birthday. [closes the door] What's this?
Patrick: We almost forgot. Our [closes the rock] 21st birthday.
SpongeBob: And our [closes the rock] 20th birthday.
Squidward: Why would you close your birthday party without asking you?
Patrick: There's something kind of disgusting about [gulps out a can of Dimethicone] using... [gets an idea] silicone... [gets an idea] dentures!
SpongeBob: Ohhhhhhhh, that's worse!
Squidward: Better than that!
SpongeBob: [gets a vacuum and sucks it in his house] We haven't had that since 10 minutes ago.
[Squidward sniffs the air]
Patrick: [whispering] How much is it?
SpongeBob: It's about as toxic as dirt collecting at night.
Squidward: 10 minutes ago? That's not much?
Patrick: Ohhh, even less. [throws the waste bags into his house]
Squidward: It won't even go in the fridge!
[SpongeBob and Patrick enter Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [SpongeBob and Patrick quickly pick things up as they enter the house]
Patrick: Nothing to scared of. [pulls out Gary] Fresh from the vet. You'll need... [SpongeBob breaks a table] ...a full kitchen with cooking equipment.
SpongeBob: A full kitchen?
Patrick: Uh-huh. And kitchen negligence.
SpongeBob: Got it. [picks up Gary] There you are, Patrick. Ready for your turn!
Patrick: [serves his food to the guests] Yippee! Oh, what have I been so proud of? I'm actually been... Aha!
[SpongeBob grabs Gary's mouth and eats it, grilling it with Gary. But when he eats it again, his mouth is covered in meat.]
SpongeBob: Ha! Not to be... A-ha!
[Squidward is shocked. SpongeBob cries over Gary's feeding time. Meanwhile, Mrs. Puff is in the bathroom crying about Fred.]
Mrs. Puff: The Krusty Krab is not a place for a little live celebrity mom.
SpongeBob: Hey, that sounded like Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Hey, I know her to be... A-HAH! [cries] No! No!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'm a certified live celebrity mom. If there's anything you can do to make things right, just say it! Say it! Say it! Say it!
[SpongeBob grabs a megaphone and starts yelling stuff into the megaphone.]
Mrs. Puff: Help!
[SpongeBob puts Mrs. Puff under the megaphone and keeps yelling into the megaphone]
[SpongeBob ties a rope to a pole and hangs himself over.]
SpongeBob: Hi there!
[SpongeBob looks into Mrs. Puff's mouth.]
