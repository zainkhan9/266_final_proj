Squidward: Ooh, Squidward, what do you want?
Squidward: I'm finished. The Krabby Patty secret recipe. [holds up a stack of money] And here's the patty secret recipe.
Squidward: [talks through the pile of money] Oh.
Squidward: I want that. [rips off his shirt and talking in a fast voice] For me to eat.
Squidward: FOR ME TO EAT. [screams]
Mr. Krabs: [reads the watch] Oh, lunch time. What's all going on in here?
Squidward: Just like last time. I'm all over SpongeBob. [holds up the watch] I wanted to eat him. But, I couldn't because... [Looks at his watch and chuckles] I'm late for work.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, it's not fair. [at work]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, whatcha doing this whole time?
SpongeBob: Waiting for the mail! [at the mailbox, and then at Sandy's Boating School]
Sandy: I want you to mail me the mail.
Sandy, Pearl, and SpongeBob: Hooray!
Sandy: The mail?
SpongeBob: Oh, yes, the mailfish can mail himself. Hey, why don't you come on back on the case and check? [looks at SpongeBob's watch] Do ya? [shows SpongeBob the mail]
Sandy: The mailman never leaves Sandy's anymore.
SpongeBob: That's great, Sandy. [laughs] I can feel your mail strings.
Sandy: Them? They're all gone. [shows SpongeBob the envelopes that the mailman left in] Those are even more expensive than Sandy's.
SpongeBob: I know, Sandy. We'll take them back, Squidward. I demand answers! [pulls out a spade and punches the envelope]
Squidward: Grr! [sees the money and gasps] What did you tell me?
SpongeBob: I know you gave the mailman all the money. [grips the money] See the damage!
Squidward: You and Squidward are playing by one set of rules... Again, an exact copy of the rules, just like me!
SpongeBob: Whatcha doing?
Squidward: You have no idea. I have the most perfect tastes. And the most perfect appetites come naturally.
SpongeBob: Naturally.
Squidward: Then what do you want?
SpongeBob: I don't know. I don't want... I don't want... I don't want...
Squidward: Give me the secret formula, and I'll give you everything you want!
SpongeBob: [laughs] I don't know how to ask you that. But you seem to be very upset that I don't have as much food as you.
Squidward: Why would you upset me?
SpongeBob: I wanted to impress you, by telling you. What, I didn't even know you existed?
Squidward: You said you existed, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: That's what I said! I want to impress you, too, just by telling you the secret formula.
Squidward: Oh. Let's get outta here then. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Well, good night, Squidward. [laughs] The formula is real, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Is it a secret?
SpongeBob: No. It's a secret that I've been concocting all my life. I'm the most famous of all the sea creatures, and now I want it to end. Which reminds me, I want it to end badly. [gulps] Can you believe it, Squidward?!
Squidward: Can you see what it is, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: It's a medium, and I just want it to be real.
Squidward: Well, I can't see it. It's a hard drive in there somewhere. [points to a hard drive in his garage]
SpongeBob: What is it, Squidward?
Squidward: It's a drive-through.
SpongeBob: Oh, I've never been on wheels before. [laughs]
Squidward: Well, this is a strange drive-through. Why is it on your head?
SpongeBob: Well, the reason why I invented rods and warts. [pulls a rod] Because they're so...icky.
