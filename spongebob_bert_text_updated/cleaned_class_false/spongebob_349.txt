[The episode launches with SpongeBob having a date with Mr. Krabs at the Chum Bucket, but SpongeBob ends up getting the deed to the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] No, you don't!
Mr. Krabs: I did! And I got rid of that deed! This town's gonna be better tomorrow!
[Suddenly, the door to the Chum Bucket slams. It turns into stone and hits Squidward in the head.]
Squidward: Ow! Okay, okay. [gets up] What happened, you? Oh, yeah. [his head turns into a ball and hits his reflection in it] Ow! Uhhh, I know! [goes to get out of the hole]
[Squidward goes back into the hole and runs out the door. An angry Mr. Krabs opens the door, gasps and screams.]
Mr. Krabs: What is it, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: [gets smacked in the head by the Pretty Patties Delivery] Ow! [sniffs] Yellow! [gets smacked back in the head] Pink! [gets smacked in the head again] Yellow! [gets smacked everywhere else, all the way to the Krusty Krab, where a notice with the word Krusty Krab on it reads "Kiddie Fast."] Welcome to the Krusty Krab, a term that was almost as offensive to me as it was insulting to you.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Nickel!
Squidward: [his eyes water up] Oh, welcome to the Krusty Krab, a five-star restaurant!
[It is now nighttime.]
SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, maybe we should think about putting on our slippers.
[He does so. Then we see the happy faces of the customers. We then get a peek at the menu.]
Squidward: All right, let's see. The Krusty Krab is famous.
[The customers eat their meals there. Then we see SpongeBob and Squidward in the kitchen. They are talking and laughing.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, we should probably try the Krusty Krab pizza.
[The customers bite into their pizza, serving it to SpongeBob and Squidward. Then we get a closer look and we see they have eaten the entire pizza. They are steaming and wheezing. Squidward screams and runs around, screaming. Mr. Krabs thenosts the window and SpongeBob and Squidward falls on the floor. Mr. Krabs throws them out and puts them back.]
Squidward: Please, shut up!
SpongeBob: But...
Squidward: But I'm not gonna stand in the way of good times! [runs to the window]
Mr. Krabs: [shocked and gone] What happened? Where am I? [gasps] Stupid customers, gone! [throws him back up] I set me foot in there! I can fix this! Well, two can play at that game!
SpongeBob: Whatcha got?
Mr. Krabs: Two that I brought in already! How about two that you brought in already? [gives SpongeBob two sticks]
SpongeBob: Uh... [sticks out two hands] Two sticks? But you want to volunteer for a newspaper?
Mr. Krabs: Stick to what?
SpongeBob: Stick to what?
Mr. Krabs: Two that I brought in already. How about two that you want to volunteer for a newspaper.
[The scene changes to show a banner that reads, "Two That We Can Work With." Mr. Krabs is shown working on it.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] One that we can work with, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Yes, boy! [to SpongeBob] I think that's the lad that we need.
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? We must need him. [they both chuckle]
[The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs leaning against the door frame. He is holding a clipboard.]
Mr. Krabs: Is this it? [we see SpongeBob with their forms on his clipboard] Our newest hired?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir. [Mr. Krabs nods] How you like it, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: It's a very basic but very important form, and I find it even simpler to work with you guys.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: It's a little more involved than that, I think. It's simpler to understand.
