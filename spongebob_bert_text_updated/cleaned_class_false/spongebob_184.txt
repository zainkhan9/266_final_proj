Mr. Krabs: [digs into his bag] What in Poseidon's beard?
[he pulls up the worker's paper and snuck inside the Krusty Krab to steal some money. The paper opens and reveals money a ring with the words 'Lord of the Flies' on it. Mr. Krabs freaks out and runs around. The crowd is not amused and throws rocks and batons at the two.]
Mr. Krabs: I may have taken some heat for my actions, but the money's on the way back!
[Mr. Krabs and the crowd become scared of Mr. Krabs and his crew and run away. Mr. Krabs notices SpongeBob and Patrick running towards him. from the crowd: Hi.
Mr. Krabs: You sneak up on me.
[the crowd becomes scared of Mr. Krabs and run away. SpongeBob and Patrick do something with their money.]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] You're not gettin' any better jobs than that! Wait a second. If these two crusty old sea-elfies wanted to pay me money...
[Mr. Krabs notices them and realizes they are the police]
Mr. Krabs: What the...! These two blundered before the mighty Krusty Krab all due to my servile hospitality. And I have restitution to pay for them!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, but, if you two want to work here, you dish out the rules, remember? This is the Krusty Krab, and if you don't come down hard, we're dead! You mean, if we come down hard, you can talk to Mr. Krabs?
[Mr. Krabs doesn't respond to his own yelling.]
Patrick: [happily] Work at the Krusty Krab? Why not go to work for me? Aw, don't want to miss out on the best delicacy?
[Mr. Krabs gets really angry at Patrick's outburst and nearly pinches Patrick for this. But this time, he pinches SpongeBob for doing a better job of cleaning tables and loading the pizzabagans for the tableboat ride.]
Mr. Krabs: [giggles] Give me that. Oh, come on. Give me that. Oh this. Give it to me. [giggles] To Patrick. [pinches Patrick's forehead]
Patrick: Oh, that's very nice. Thanks, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, we got some business to run.
Patrick: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: [happily] Yeah? How do we get paid for cleaning?
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is hanging round the walls. Mr. Krabs is taking the lead in making the table.]
Mr. Krabs: There's the table, lad. I think I can recommend this place. [The door opens and two robots that resemble Mr. Krabs appear]
Squidward: [with hat] Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [having trouble getting out of the hat] What do ye think of these whistlins, boys?
Squidward: They're dorks. They're morons.
Mr. Krabs: What are ye looking at, Squidward? [the two robots that resemble Squidward appear again]
Squidward: Hello.
Mr. Krabs: What's that, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: I like you. Dollies, no.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't think you'll need one. [the two robots that resemble Squidward appear again, but with mouths]
SpongeBob: I don't know, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't, Theodor [tape singing] It's not covered by your suit, boy.
SpongeBob: Why, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Because, lad, these whistlins hate money.
Squidward: Nuh-uh. [throws out the money]
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, that's enough, boy. You're hired.
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs. Time to put on the hats. [The scene cuts to a Krabby Patty sliding around the restaurant as the screen pans in on another one of the Krusty Krab signs]
