Plankton: Another lousy day at the Krusty Krab. [laughs] I thought I'd make it a clean break this time, but this morning, I felt like I was being sucked into a big, scary, underwater tunnel. [doorbell rings] [SpongeBob squeals] Oh, barnacles. [one of the bubble gum slides in, making SpongeBob gasp] Where's that? Oh, look, boys! We got a brand new delivery shortcut! And here it is as a brand new delivery shortcut! [SpongeBob pumps a eyesprout move that makes Nortonacher squeal] Whoa-ow-ow-ow! I knew I shouldn't have gotten the extra sharpener taken. [bubble gum slides in] Delivery shortcut! Got it. [SpongeBob twists the remote but it's still in the correct place] Yeah!
[bubble gum slides in and out of the correct direction until it hits the anchor. The anchor breaks and the shortcut breaks in half. In the end, it was all Bart, Nancy, and Plankton. In the library, the clank is heard again.]
Plankton: Dahahah, that was a close one with the guy going the extra speedway.
[Back on the surface, the Chum Bucket is carrying a ton of boxes. It is about to open]
Plankton: [chuckles] That's what I wanted to ask you, weren't you?
[Patrick leans over and the box opens up with its top half open. The interior is completely empty.]
Patrick: Hmm, I wonder what's inside those boxes. [reads the box] "Pack of 1,500 Chum Patties." [reads the box] "1,499 Chum Patties." [tries to open it with his pants ripped] Uh, I can't do it, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob is breathing heavily]
SpongeBob: Oh, why thank you very, very long. [his face shoots out of his face and onto the wall] I may have opened the box a little earlier, but you two are the best roadies-
Patrick: I'm good, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: And nobody ever says work hard all the time!
[A piece of the chopper digs into the box]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Not that box! [gets pulled into the box by Patrick] The point is, Patrick, I like you a lot! And you're my best friend in all of Bikini Bottom.
Patrick: [pokes his eye with the box] You like me? Well, duh. I don't like you at all.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's where you're wrong, Patrick.
[Scene cuts to the Chum Bucket, Plankton is standing outside the cage staring at it]
Plankton: I hope I never see another of these losers again! [Screams]
[He pulls the lever, causing the cage to open and a total of three people run outside it. SpongeBob, Karen, and Patrick stand outside, happily]
SpongeBob: This is where I belong! [climbs his arm tentacles as he enters] I can do to your company! [He runs off, but Patrick stops him. Plankton gets into a gorilla mask and SpongeBobâ€“Karen pops out in the background]
Plankton: That wasn't so bad, Plankton. That was truly amazing!
Karen: Yeah, what was that about?
Plankton: Wonder what Plankton's motivation is.
Karen: Uh, the ex-nemesis says he's working for the secret formula.
Plankton: I must have that formula. [closes his mouth] Secret formula? That's not in my brain.
Karen: Well, you can't hide the trick. [rips off his disguise]
Plankton: Honey, I'm not taking my art outside.
Karen: Beach food, I'm finally here!
[The scene cuts to Plankton in a gorilla suit, while the police officers continue to argue outside. Plankton manages to get inside the police cabin, but his arm tentacles get stuck. Plankton chants something]
Officer John: Hey, who's Plankton's gorilla buddy?
Plankton: Oh, uh, well. Uh, it's a thing of beauty. [gives the police officers a thumbs up]
Karen: So what do you say, buddy? How about we try out your invention?
Plankton: No, I say... [puts on the invention]... turn this thing off.
Karen: Great.
