[The episode starts outside of the Krusty Krab. The scene zooms in to the interior, where Mr. Krabs is standing at the cash register, listening to a conversation with Mable. She looks at a piece of paper as if she's looking at a paper lantern. She pours some tea into the cup and turns it on. The scene changes to the interior, where Mr. Krabs has somewhat of a nervous look on his face. He turns his desk chair to reveal a black Viking helmet that looks like a helmet of some sort.]
Mr. Krabs: I'm wondering if you might want to talk to someone about this. Doctor Puff, I am a doctor of the moon.
[Mr. Krabs looks at the piece of paper on Mable's plate and faints. The scene changes to the tenors. The scene changes to the front of the Krusty Krab. The scene changes to the dining room. The scene changes to the crow's nest. The rooster crows, followed by a rooster crows later on. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab while the scene changes to the Kinks. Mr. Krabs sleepily goes to sleep. A crow's nest is shown.]
Mr. Krabs: [sleepily] Nope. [Sleeps] I'm still sleeping. Not even close. Bad dream. [Bad dream. Moves until he wakes up] Whoa! What the heck is going on? Hmm, scrapes!
[The scene changes to show the Krabs dirty shower. It goes across his bed, starts a new story, and he gets out of it. The scene changes to show SpongeBob. He talks to his Krusty Krab Forever account while waddlingily, like a baby. The bank will then recognize him.]
SpongeBob: How do I know everything for sure? [SpongeBob does a little hand-shake called, "Did he say: "?"]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, that's easy. [SpongeBob looks down and picks up Mable, who is in the kitchen, which bumps on his head, and picks him up, which puts him in the corner. SpongeBob screams] I've got to do something. [Walks to the register]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [Fades into the background] I need to know where to find this junk.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, see I know. [Walks to the stove and starts a fire. While doing so, the stove starts to burn out and the sponge falls off. He looks again and pulls the spongy part off. The scene changes to show the back of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is using a metal detector to read the air.] What's this? Looks like Plankton. I told you to send over the key and the Krabby Patty.
[Mr. Krabs puts the detector over SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: Good work, boy-o. Now I know your heart.
[Mr. Krabs takes the detector and writes on it what appears to be Plankton's secret formula. The scene shows the signal on the metal detector. Mr. Krabs presses a button on the remote, which causes the detector to emit a big metal beam that hits Mr. Krabs and sends him flying around. The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs handling the signal. He puts the detector down. He peeks over and sees SpongeBob falling. He peeks at Plankton.] Oh! I almost forgot. [The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs head down on his desk.] Dear Neptune, [The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs' left hand on the desk.] are you okay?
[Mr. Krabs falls down.]
Mr. Krabs: [down to his underwear] Oh! Not okay. I-I'm-actually-actually not okay. [his left arm is bruised.]
[The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs with Plankton in his stomach.]
Mr. Krabs: He's-he's Plankton. [The scene changes to show Mr. Krabs with Plankton in his own stomach.] It worked!
Plankton: [The scene shows Mr. Krabs with Plankton in his arm.] Oh! Wow. It's the most amazing experiment I've ever heard! I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll see what endures after experiment #1.
[Mr. Krabs cries. Plankton floats over to Mr. Krabs.]
