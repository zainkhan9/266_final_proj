[The scene freezes at Squidward's house where Squidward is preparing to polish his teeth. He looks out the window and notices something behind it.]
Squidward: Excuse me?
Frankie Billy: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Excuse me? For me?
Frankie Billy: So, what are you working on, Squidward?
Squidward: This is a good one. The polish's been here for three days. I want to polish it.
Frankie Billy: Yeah, you heard me, son. We just haven't had a chance to buff up the rest of the teeth.
Squidward: Oh. So, you got any plans for today?
[Frankie Billy gives Squidward a bowl full of polish.]
Frankie Billy: One bottle of polishes, a playpen, and two pointers on the bowl.
Squidward: Me, too.
[The scene changes to all of Squidward's friends leading a relaxing evening.]
Nancy Suzy Fish: Oh, my gosh, a perfect evening.
Jennifer Millie: I'm so happy that Squidward has learned his lesson!
[A scallop crows like a rooster.]
Squidward: Oh, my gosh.
[SpongeBob and the others gather around.]
SpongeBob: I've never been so happy.
Squidward: I've been a bit busy today.
SpongeBob: Tomorrow, I'm going to go and get some nails.
Squidward: I have a mast!
[SpongeBob lays on his face and his nose is covered with mud.]
SpongeBob: Well, that went better than expected.
Squidward: I wanted to give a speech today.
[The crowd cheers.]
Nancy Suzy Fish: But I can't!
Fred: Can't even come to a house yet!
Nancy Suzy Fish: And you can't even come right up to my house yet!
Fred: Oh, I can! It's a gift!
Squidward: Ha! What did I ever think to get?
[Fred shuts his eyes and squeals in joy.]
Nancy Suzy Fish: And here's a never-ending supply of cleaning products that I didn't know existed!
[The scene changes to SpongeBob getting some cleaning products from the Krusty Krab. Frankie Billy comes with a bag and is trying to play SpongeBob some more.]
SpongeBob: [tosses bag away] Forget the bag, Billy. Let's go to Squidward's.
[SpongeBob and Frankie Billy walk to the Squidward's. Squidward comes up with a puzzle out of his pocket.]
Squidward: What's this for?
[SpongeBob picks it up and goes to work. The bag turns into Plankton, a clone of himself that was once Frankie Billy's best friend until he sees Squidward.]
Plankton: Oh, uh, Squidward? Did you ever notice I'm taller?
Squidward: Yeah.
Plankton: Maybe that's why I keep telling you, uh... tell it to your friends. [laughs]
[They climb up to Squidward's computer base.]
SpongeBob: See what I mean?
Squidward: Well, now that you give me all your secrets the good cop. [grunts as he tries to get his head through the door]
SpongeBob: But which ones?
Squidward: Well, the ones that I really liked about a fly lower in the dark, and the ones where you never know about my secret again.
[SpongeBob removes one of the windows, but Plankton pushes him back into the box. He groans and jumps on the bed.]
Plankton: That's it, Easy! You'll learn! You won't have to wait any longer!
[Squidward joins SpongeBob and Plankton up here.]
SpongeBob: I'll show you everything, Plankton, but only the things that are really important.
Plankton: Really? What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Well, nothing, I guess.
Plankton: Then can I show you...
SpongeBob: Things I wouldn't want in a baby.
[Plankton shows SpongeBob the baby in the window. It's the baby that accidentally closes in its cage.]
Plankton: Good choice. Now you can show him things that would never happen to you.
SpongeBob: Oh, Plankton...
Plankton: Would you like that cage back?
SpongeBob: Uh, of course. See ya later, Plankton.
