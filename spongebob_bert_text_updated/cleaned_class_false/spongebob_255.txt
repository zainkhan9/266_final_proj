SpongeBob: [as he dances to the music] ♪La La La La La La, la la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la!♪ [Patchy smells the scent of his worn-out, old cell phone. He goes back to dancing and dances all the way to the boatmobile's horn. Then he crashes through his fantasy cell tower and into his bed, breaking his straining tentacles. He wraps his tentacles around the cell tower and starts over again and starts over again. Then he falls off the cell tower and we see what's happening. He starts over again and starts over again. Again. Again. The wind blows. The window opens and the wind blows. A very angry fish walks up to SpongeBob's house] Hello, SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob:  *SPAAAAALSLLL!!!! You're taking a vacation! I'm fired! I Am I Am I Am! I'm an idiot! What the?! [His eyelids rip through his clothing. SpongeBob walks into the kitchen and opens a pot and sautees some of the Krabby Patties for him]
SpongeBob: All right, Gary, you just spurn my invitations to the fezel fry up and send over the weekend for the first time ever! But I want my Krabby Patty the same day! Cobras, blah blah blah blah blah blah. [Gary brings a plate full of Krabby Patties into the kitchen] Here you go.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm going to cut down these orders right here. [cut to Squidward bringing more patties over for the fezel fry up] Gary, I'm not feeling very energized.
Squidward: [sighs] I. How are I ever, if I ever am, if ever am Krabby Patty no good?
SpongeBob: I don't know about you, either. [Gary tries to bite SpongeBob]
Squidward: [laughs] Don't be selfish, SpongeBob. I'll take care of it. [Cut to inside the kitchen of the kitchen of the fezel fry up]
Mrs. Puff: You sure everything?
Squidward: [still laughing] Oh, sure everything, yes everything. [laughing]
Mrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, time to karate chop SpongeBob. [walks up to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey there buddy. What did you say?
Mrs. Puff: I don't think so let's just take a look. [SpongeBob looks out the window]
SpongeBob: Good idea. [walks back to his house]
Mrs. Puff: Now that we have a nice nice area out back where all the steam is eliminated, I would like to take you in as a guest.
SpongeBob: A guest? My best friend?
Mrs. Puff: That's a good idea I have a say about it.
SpongeBob: You heard what I said before. Gary, no one else would be excited about coming to your party.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No one else would? We are just here for you. [partygoers arrive]
Gary: Meow.
 [cut to SpongeBob coming out of the shower]
SpongeBob: [takes off the shower cap] Ding! [turns it off, then puts his head in the ground. He hears someone screaming] Oh no! Nobody's coming] Ding! [someone comes toward SpongeBob screaming. SpongeBob jumps] You're not coming out of here scared, are ya? [speaker makes a loud voice] Who's there?
Lou: [speaking gibberish]
SpongeBob: [hatches] Oh, what happened?
Lou: It was the horns! I was out of karate, Gary.
SpongeBob: Oh no, I was! [he runs out of the kitchen] I was... leaving!
