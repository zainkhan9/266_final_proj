[The episode opens at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is once again away on a business trip.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, Ah, ah— [screams as he runs into SpongeBob in his office] SpongeBob! [cries] I need a break! [laughs]
[SpongeBob comes back and back in real fast. But he bumps into Mr. Krabs so he can't see his butt]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I can't take anymore business trips!
[Mr. Krabs gets back into his office and dozens of bills pour out of him in fast motion. Mr. Krabs becomes dumbfounded.]
Mr. Krabs: [gulps] Great... [gets pushed into his chair by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [appears in a suit] What kind of trip is this?
Mr. Krabs: [gets pushed into his chair] Well, it's right here at the Krusty Krab. I need a little personal help here.
SpongeBob: [adjusts his glasses] Uhh, can I help you?
Mr. Krabs: Sure. [pulls one of his glasses out and pours it in SpongeBob's mouth] Here's your allowance, boy.
SpongeBob: My pleasure.
Mr. Krabs: I think you'll find all these out here. So, when the coming of the coming, I mean the coming-of the coming. [takes a paper out from his pocket and reads it] Roar! Come to papa. Come to papa. [takes paper and pours SpongeBob along] Aw, looks like the coming's already happening. [walks away] Sounds right. [SpongeBob's footsteps echo off the Krusty Krab. Cut to later when Mr. Krabs returns to the Krusty Krab.] So, this is how it's always gonna be. [pretends to eat a cookie] Oh, what do I care? [takes a bite out of a cookie but of course, the cookie turns into a brick] I'm gonna eat this! [laughs]
[Mr. Krabs peels himself from the doors of the Krusty Krab. He goes to the dining area, opens the kitchen door, and walks over to sit between Fred and Martha.]
Fred: Mr. Krabs, what are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Well, since I got back, I've been working at the– at the Krusty Krab. Well, at least my sweet, old self's birthday party is tomorrow. [runs out of the Krusty Krab] Phew! My time here is over. [runs back into Krabs' house]-- I– I mean, Krabby Patties.
[Suddenly, the doorbell rings. Krabs screams in terror. He climbs up the pole and sees the door opening. He climbs up inside a puddle of soda. He takes the pattie inside and sucks out the soda. The patties taste really really really good. Mr. Krabs gets really angry.]
Mr. Krabs: Holy shrimp! That's the Krabby Patty I ordered! And here it is– the– the– the Krabby Patty! [shudders]
[The patties are taken outside and Mr. Krabs is really mad. He starts yelling gibberish into a big glass.]
Mr. Krabs: [hits himself in the head with the big glass] That's the Krabby Patty! [gibbers]
[The scene changes to the lunch hour. SpongeBob and Squidward sit in the register boat next to Mr. Krabs' house.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, look! It's payday.
Squidward: Here's the check. [points to his paycheck]
SpongeBob: I can pay for this with my savings!
[The two giggle. Mr. Krabs is so mad, he actually opens the door.]
Mr. Krabs: Simple will you?
SpongeBob: Yow!
Mr. Krabs: Open up! [squirts money on the gas pedal to start the truck running] Pay me!
[SpongeBob happily carries the patties out of the kitchen. Squidward continues to laugh as he walks.]
Squidward: Here I come!
[The truck runs down the road, leaving a trail of destruction.]
Mr. Krabs: Okay, SpongeBob, you got me. You see, this was a senseless game of chance. [laughs] He ran it over in the dining area, man.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please explain!
