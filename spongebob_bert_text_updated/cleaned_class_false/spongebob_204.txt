[The episode begins with a shot of the Krusty Krab kitchen.]
TV Announcer: And now, back to the...
[A small customer walks up to them.]
Small customer: Thanks again, Mr. Krabs.
[The customer picks up SpongeBob and eats some Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: Oh! Another delicious Krabby Patty.
Customers: [chanting] Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What?
[The scene shows another customer giving a Krabby Patty to a customer wearing a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are shown chanting "Krabs".]
SpongeBob: Krabs, do you want money or did you come to the Krabs' house already?
[The scene returns to Small Business Administrator Squidward about to move his furniture.]
Squidward: Get moving. Set you fire!
[Squidward fires his fire-retardant machine. The scene returns to Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: That'll be the year the old planks rise again. And I made an even better one. Krabby Patties. [Mr. Krabs puts a piece of himself on the mantel.] Go ahead, you, Squidward, but uh, be cautious!
Squidward: Be cautious? I'm not letting you off the hook.
Mr. Krabs: You know, son, being captain of the submarine means a great deal to me.
Squidward: Uh, half the time, it just makes you think you're something else.
Mr. Krabs: That's exactly the opposite. In fact, I'd say you're the best guy you know. [Mr. Krabs puts a banana peel on himself. The scene returns to Squidward. He puts a piece of himself on the mantel.] Uh, hello? [he gets an idea. The scene returns to Squidward.] Go ahead, you, Squidward, say hello.
Squidward: Hello, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Hello, Mr. Squidward. [The scene returns to Squidward.] Hello... Squidward. [The lines are almost the same as before. Mr. Krabs starts to cry. The scene returns to Squidward.] Squidward, you're not welcome. [Squidward looks ahead.] Now, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: Going... to work. [The scene returns to Mr. Krabs.] Now, the Krusty Krab is a lovely, rustic haven. [Squidward turns his head.] It's a haven that has recently emerged, [Mr. Krabs stops crying.] and littered every inch of its path.
[Mr. Krabs starts to cry himself out.]
Mr. Krabs: Ohh... who's going? [The scene returns to Squidward.] Eh?
Squidward: Eh?
Mr. Krabs: It's this Sunday morning. [He takes a deep breath and holds it until it's past and then he holds it again until it's past and he holds it again. Finally, it's past.] And now... [He breathes in and out] what began like an eternity-like sprint to the Krusty Krab is now a blood-curdling 60% faster than it was a few minutes ago...
[Squidward becomes dizzy.]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward!
Squidward: [He runs] You're not Hydrodynamite!
Mr. Krabs: This is gonna be so funny.
Squidward: Oh, I've never been kicked in the face!
SpongeBob: [Off-Screen] Hey, that's not what I said!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, this is gonna be so funny! [He claps] Yeah!
[SpongeBob walks up to Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward up here.
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I said, you're not Hydrodynamite!
Squidward: You're looking at the time here! [He imagines himself in the time machine again.] You can't have jobs, you can't work... you're annihilated!
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Time machine?
Squidward: You better not be making jokes or I'm going to yell at you. Punch it!
[He kicks SpongeBob in the head and runs off-screen. He stops in front of a chalkboard with a box on it.]
Squidward: Alright, punch it! It's more fun to make a dodgeball with that than to write a check!
