SpongeBob: That's right, Squidward! We're watching you while you practice our FistPants!
Squidward: [shakes his head] Nope! Not a sign of squat! [laughs]
SpongeBob: I've been practicing for twenty minutes now. [laughs also]
[SpongeBob grabs a tape recorder and starts putting the songs on the record. One squawk at a time, SpongeBob tunes to how the creature looks like. SpongeBob rings the bell, and the blimp flies over Squidward. SpongeBob drops the blimp in his backpack. Patrick pops out of his backpack.]
Patrick: Yoo-hoo! I dropped my backpack on the ground.
[SpongeBob drops the blimp and goes to land it on Squidward's house. He does so, Squidward opens the window, and when he lands on the floor, SpongeBob hits the blimp with the trident. The blimp flies onto Squidward's lawn, and SpongeBob does his yard work as lawnmower. SpongeBob manages to catch the blimp with the trident, and makes it fly right under Squidward's newspaper. The blimp flies into Squidward's eye, causing him to climb over to SpongeBob, and makes him readjust the trident. SpongeBob is annoyed, and the window of Squidward's house creaks a little. SpongeBob walks to the front door, and goes to answer Patrick's door.]
SpongeBob: Bye, Patrick. Bye, Patrick. [knocks on the door] Patrick?
[Patrick answers himself, and SpongeBob goes to hear what he say.]
Patrick: Oh, Manum Wa! Oh, Manum Wa! [grunts] Oh, Manum Wa!
[SpongeBob hears Patrick's laughter, and he looks around to see the man he suspects is lying. The window of his house cracks, and smoke comes out.]
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick! Was it ice cream or a flower, man?
Patrick: Why, both are right! The vegetable and the fruit are alike, and the man is the center of the universe, while the fruit is in the order he chooses.
SpongeBob: Well, there's only one explanation. How did you get here?
Patrick: I don't know. Play, trick, or game?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [pulls out a coin, and holds it up] How did you get here?
Patrick: I don't know.
SpongeBob: [puts the coin in a coin slot on his head] Clue. Clue. Clue!
[SpongeBob shows him the coin. It's a picture of the Greek tragedy hero Cleopatss; SpongeBob then yells in delight as the crowd cheers]
SpongeBob: Oh, my! Holy shower of Greek tears! [crowd cheers, Squidward is deeply touched by the tears, and he looks completely heartened]
Squidward: What is this? Help me?
[The scene cuts to a wide shot of the crowd, cheering. The scene pans in. Then the tear drains from both of his eyes, revealing a spot, and from the drain, revealing his mouth full of tear]
Patrick: Thanks, SpongeBob. [crowd leaves, and SpongeBob walks up to Patrick]
SpongeBob: Don't leave me, Patrick. I'm lonely.
Patrick: Lonely? Really? How do people know one another? There's no common purpose in life.
SpongeBob: So, Squidward, what do you have?
Patrick: Well, I have friends. [laughs]
SpongeBob: [knocks on Patrick's rock] What in Patrick's name is a... [Rock pops into his house, revealing the Trampoline in the title cards for the first time]
Patrick: SpongeBob! The Electric Eel! [SpongeBob screams, and pushes Patrick's rock to the wall, and laughs]
SpongeBob: Now that's the Man Ray! [SpongeBob zoomods over to the Flying Dutch Guy, who is revealed to be sitting in a chair, listening to a soothing voice]
Flying Dutch Guy: Is he really my man?
SpongeBob: I don't know.
