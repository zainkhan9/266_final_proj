[episode starts with Gary's rock getting broken. Cut to SpongeBob bringing a boatmobile down a mountain]
SpongeBob: Gary! [turns to see Gary] Hey, buddy. I'll go get your toothbrush. [goes to get his boat key but it's still inside his SpongeBob costume] Gary, you gotta get in line! Oh, but you could get hurt trying. [tries to get it out, but opens himself] Ugh! Bad Guy 1: Me? No, get in line! Bad Guy 2: Help, help! Help me! Bad Guy 3: Help, help me! Help, help! [Gary steps on him and SpongeBob screams] Gary, you gotta help! Bad Guy 1: Hey, I need your help! Uh, I was thinking about putting a pair of pants on my legs!
Gary: [mumbles angrily]
SpongeBob: Help, help! Gary! [turns around and runs away] Gary! [turns back around] Gary! [turns sad] Oh, I'm ruined. [cut to the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is busy picking up the garbage]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what's wrong, boy?
Mr. Krabs: Umm...something fishy. Haven't cleaned in weeks. I need a fresh pair of pants. [SpongeBob hands the garbage to him]
SpongeBob: Here you go, sir. [Walks off]
Mr. Krabs: I'm not here to see you, boy. [To his coworker] Here you go, sir. [To his coworker] Here you go, mister.
SpongeBob: I'm in the basement, sort of, wiring.
Harold: Uh, where's your pants?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I don't know. Over here.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mr. Krabs, I need your deposit back!
Mr. Krabs: What? No, no, no, I'm in it for the money. I can't beat you over here. It's not worth it.
SpongeBob: It is?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it is. I don't think so. I rather go home. [Walks out of SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: I don't think so, either. Over here. [Walks to the door and opens it] Gary, I need a change. [doorbell rings]
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: [Sitting in his boat] Well, I can't fit you in here. We've got to go home. What do you think about Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: I think he's a pansy. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, come on, boy. We shouldn't throw away a family member's deposit. Let's not waste any time getting rid of old money.
SpongeBob: Why don't you just promise me one thing?
Mr. Krabs: Just promise me one thing. And, if you don't, I'll make one for you.
SpongeBob: Okay, promise me. [snaps his fingers]
Mr. Krabs: Okay. [cuts to SpongeBob walking out of his house on a roll of toilet paper]
SpongeBob: promise me...
Patrick: [Cuts to Patrick at work] And... promise me one thing. And... and... and...
Employee: Coffee break, guaranteed.
SpongeBob: [Eats a mug of coffee] One more thing, and I'll...
Employee: Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee!
SpongeBob: [Eats another mug of coffee] One more thing, and I'll... and...
Employee: Never mind that. You've seen enough.
