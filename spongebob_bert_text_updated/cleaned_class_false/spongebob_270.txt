[The episode starts with Tom skipping home for work at the Krusty Krab. He stops at a drive thru and makes weird, yet repetitive noises.]
Mrs. Puff: Ohh, is that clams and the sea chimps here?
 SpongeBob: Oh, they're here, Mrs. Puff. I've been goin' to work here for weeks. [A patty flips in the wind]
 Mrs. Puff: [Gasps] But what about the secret formula?!
 SpongeBob: Well, it's actually a semi-decoy formula that says here, here, andâ€” [makes weird noises as he shakes the bottle often] [screams]
 Mrs. Puff: Maybe he's just hungry. [sets the bottle beside her]
 SpongeBob: Take my bottle!
 Mrs. Puff: Why won't he just eat my fork? [Sounds of conflict building up until it reaches the end of the episode]
 SpongeBob: Dig in, Mrs. Puff?
 Mrs. Puff: What's with all the ruckus?
 SpongeBob: Oh, there you are, lady.
 Mrs. Puff: What are you talking about, Sponge?
 SpongeBob: I'm talking about this. [shows the formula to Mrs. Puff] It's a little bit suspicious, but I want it to show Barnacle Boy.
 Mrs. Puff: Barnacle Boy?
 SpongeBob: Look, look at that face. It's all yours.
 Mrs. Puff: [Furious] What the...? oh, wait. I'm all yours! [Door closes. Scene cuts to all of them and a robber runs through a line]
Robber: Hi, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: What are you doing with my clothes?
Robber: I'm going to steal your...
Mrs. Puff: Get in your cell and lock me upstairs.
Robber: Well, that's a pretty raunchy reek.
Mrs. Puff: I'm afraid you haven't done anything wrong.
Robber: No, I haven't. Sorry, just five seconds. [walks in]
Mrs. Puff: Good morning. [leans over SpongeBob and screams]
Robber: I'll confess. What a pretty face. [laughs]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Robber: I'm going to buy you a couple of new clothes.
Mrs. Puff: That's what I said. [leans towards her]
Robber: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff, but you're stealing my underwear?
Mrs. Puff: Well, that's not what this looks like.
Robber: Look at it! My underpants!
Mrs. Puff: Ooh, I know! My tight little butt! But you're not letting go of me!
Robber: Can't you see, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: No way! You're still stealing my underpants!
Narrator: One shift later...
Mrs. Puff: Oh, SpongeBob, what a pretty sky. Sure is it, SpongeBob? Oh, SpongeBob, what's that horrible growling behind?
SpongeBob: That, Mrs. Puff, it! [A lump in his pants rolls up his nose.]
Mrs. Puff: What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's getting here. Hey, a man! Whoa! [chuckles] Mrs. Puff, you found me silverware!
Mrs. Puff: That's it. Good day, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: The man! I need it! [She flings the goods she is holding onto SpongeBob, knocking him down. The things fall onto the ground and Mrs. Puff picks them up.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, lady! Do you have anything to say to me?
