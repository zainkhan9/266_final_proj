[Opens the episode's title screen with a light. The episode opens up outside.]
TV Announcer: I want a whale so badly, I'll go out of the way to get you, if it kills someone, you'll be it.
[The scene shows a whale that looks like SpongeBob walking up to a house, knocks on the door, and opens the door.]
SpongeBob: [As the episode begins] Hi, guys.
Announcer: Please tell me you're SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You're SpongeBob. And you know what day it is.
Announcer and SpongeBob Attendance Ticket Sales: [Off-Screen] Nothing beats showing up, kid! Here's your typical jelly sandwich, with a side of hummus, and... hummus.
SpongeBob: [Sees a back right side of hummus, but the back side is missing] The back side? [looks up at the ground and notices the back side of the sandwich has a bun and cheese on it] I missed that!
[SpongeBob tries opening the front side of the sandwich, but crashes into the seats. The arms and legs fall off the plane and land on the ground far away from the ground. SpongeBob gasps] The back side. [looks up at the ground and notices the back side of the sandwich has a bun and cheese on it] That's it! The real deal! [SpongeBob's eyes pop out when he sees that the back side of the sandwich has a sticker similar to the word "undesirable" on it. SpongeBob gasps] The back side. [SpongeBob sticks his hand in the sticker and screams] I'll get it! I'll get it!
[SpongeBob runs off and runs even faster, but since his speed was already better than Squidward's, he replaced it.]
Squidward: [walks by Mr. Krabs] This place is so... illegal!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah. But here I was as... [knocks on door again] ...terrified!
Squidward: Oh, yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I'll show you, Squidward, [calls a cab] and... [Mr. Krabs pats Squidward] Oh, no.
Squidward: Yes, please. I'm so sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: But what about crime?
Squidward: [shouts] Hate.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you mean you're putting this place on surveillance?
Squidward: Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I don't spy, you slithered off the hook!
Squidward: I do spy.
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs. Hate crime, how much money do you have?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, say, 20 bucks, or the successor may be hired.
SpongeBob: [gasps] But who's the pirate, sir?
Mr. Krabs: The one who took all my money.
SpongeBob:20 bucks? Mr. Krabs, you didn't even get 20 bucks!
[Mr. Krabs goes to SpongeBob's house and sees SpongeBob sleeping in his bed. He locks the door and SpongeBob goes to sleep.]
Squidward: Naps only.
[SpongeBob pulls himself out of bed and starts to go to sleep. But as he wakes up, he sees all his walls are boarded up and his entire bedroom looks like a wall. It gets worse and worse as time goes on.]
SpongeBob: Gary? Your house is paved. [takes Gary out of SpongeBob's bed and puts him on the top of his bed] Gary, why couldn't I just get a ketchup bottle? [gives him ketchup and it starts to color red]
Squidward: You're just not half bad buddy. [SpongeBob sniffles] Did you see that, SpongeBob? Oh, yeah. I overslept. [SpongeBob sniffles again and slithers off. Squidward groans and slithers to the door, slamming it shut. He then walks back to SpongeBob] I didn't sleep so good last night, Squidward. [walks upstairs]
