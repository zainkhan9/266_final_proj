[The episode starts with Gary snoring. The TV starts to shake. Gary wakes up from his nap. He goes to tuck himself in, but gets whacked with the television's remote before he gets up. Gary slithers towards the door, towards Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Ow!
[Gary growls and heads towards Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Youâ€™re taking me business!
[Mr. Krabs pushes Gary out of the way so he can get into the door. Gary steps on the button and jumps jumps into the Krabby Patty. After Gary takes the patty, the menu flips to show a salad bar with lettuce, tomato, chum cheese, ketchup, cayenne, cayenne, ketchup, kielbasas, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, and buns]
Squidward: [groaning in pain] Hmph. The only other customer is SpongeBob. [walks over to Mr. Krabs] I can't have that. [takes the patty from Gary] Or maybe SpongeBob will just find you so you can get back into the restaurant you love.
[Mr. Krabs takes the patty from Gary and puts it in the container that is Mr. Krabs office. Then he leads Squidward through the kitchen, which is shaped like a refrigerator.]
Mr. Krabs: I love you, Squidward.
[Squidward closes his eyes and sees a refrigerator covered in cheese. He gasps in amazement. He then thinks in more detail and realizes that the refrigerator is made of a different material. Squidward opens the refrigerator and notice is the refrigerator's littlest bubbles. Squidward then notices there's a kelp salad on the menu, and that the customer can only order it with ketchup. Squidward closes the refrigerator lid and thinks really about what he just heard.]
Squidward: [starts crying in shock] SpongeBob! You were supposed to make me a teddy bear!
SpongeBob: A bear? I thought you were the giant!
Squidward: I love my teddy bears! [tears his shirt off] I'll take them away, SpongeBob!
[Squidward closes the refrigerator lid and thinks really about what he just heard.]
Squidward: [laughs] I hate giant bikers.
[Gary slithers down to the giant biker gang. SpongeBob and Gary start eating giant burgers. SpongeBob starts eating hamburger doughnuts, Gary starts eating doughnuts, and Patrick starts eating his burger in the sink. Patrick starts drinking water from his burger, and SpongeBob starts drinking water from his burger.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Oh, Gary. Looky' other.
[Gary growls, and SpongeBob starts drinking SpongeBob water from his kelp salad, then Patrick starts drinking SpongeBob water from his kelp salad, and then both of them are dead tired from eating burgers. Mr. Krabs escorts Gary out of the bathroom, and both of them sit on poles, so they won't move too much. Mr. Krabs lifts the pole up, which makes Gary's burger look like a burger. Mr. Krabs puts the burger on the pole, and Gary sits down.]
Mr. Krabs: There, there now, gents. Just as I predicted, moppingtailing. [tongue wag turns into a wag and becomes a wagworm] Oops! I lost the nitpick. [giggles]
[Gary's burger becomes tangled in the tangled wires of Mr. Krabs' warden's wig. Mr. Krabs tries to clean the burger, but becomes tangled in the wires. So he curls up and uses a rope to turn the wig's wires into gold.]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, nitwit!
[Mr. Krabs uses a giant comb to chop the wig's wires into gold. Then he uses a giant swab to dig into the wig's wig. Then he uses a needle to swab into the wig's wig and grabs the broken pieces.
