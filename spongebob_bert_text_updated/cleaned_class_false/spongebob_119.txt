PlanKrab: [The scene shows the exterior of the Krusty Krab. PlanKrab is shown in his office. The scene zooms into the front windows of the restaurant. He is shown flipping through the pages. The page opens shows Mr. Krabs reading a magazine.] [As the crowd of people is shown, they are cheering] Thank you, Thank yous! Thank you! I hope we can finally close this restaurant down, Officer!
PlanKrab: No! Let me make it up to you!
Mr. Krabs: It's almost time, Mr. Squidward. [The scene zooms into the future. Mr. Krabs is in the present, the exterior of the Krusty Krab. The scene opens and the crowd is shown. Mr. Krabs has just returned from his vacation in the restaurant.] I hope you like your vacation in Bikini Bottom, Officer. I hope your vacation in Bikini Bottom is happier.
Squidward: [Off-Screen] It's okay, Mr. Krabs. My vacation in Bikini Bottom is over.
Mr. Krabs: [He returns with a bag full of money.] Here you go, me boy!
Squidward: [Taking the money.] Enjoy my money!
SpongeBob: Happy Bikini Bottom! [SpongeBob lands on the window with all his money and the customers listen from outside.] Happy Bikini Bottom! [Thinking] Dowager leagues.
[The scene changes to the future. Mr. Krabs has just returned from his vacation in Bikini Bottom.]
EMBEDATORS: Take him away, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs: [Looking at SpongeBob] Eh, that's okay. That's my precautionary measure you're taking. [The EMB officer comes in, taps SpongeBob's shoulder, and takes out a straw] We're going to be at a loss for words, son. [The officer gives Mr. Krabs the straw.] We actually having a buyer.
Mr. Krabs: What?
EMBEDATORS: This is for you.
Mr. Krabs: Don't look away. We've got a pretty good idea who we have.
EMBEDATORS: That's perfectly realistic. I guarantee it.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't.
EMBEDATORS: But I...I's not buying it.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah.
[Mr. Krabs straws the EMB officer in a bar of soap. SpongeBob is shown wearing the officer's outfit. SpongeBob removes his shirt and applies the officer's on his face. He puts his hand in front of Mr. Krabs and says "Hi Mr. Krabs". He puts his foot in back.]
Mr. Krabs: Hey.
[The scene changes to the Krusty Krab the next day. Mr. Krabs is looking at Plankton with a British accent.]
Mr. Krabs: So that's how you're gonna get the "Krabs out of me money"?
Plankton: No. [Mr. Krabs stares at SpongeBob and the scene changes to a boat parked next to the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: What's with the honking?
SpongeBob: Plankton just drove over here and there, and I could hear his every move. [Mr. Krabs drives past SpongeBob and SpongeBob gets angry. The scene changes to a boat in front of a restaurant shaped like a Krusty Krab.] Plankton's plan works! He got the money from Davy Jones.
Mr. Krabs: [Off-Screen] Hey, Davy! What're ya doing here, lad?
Davy: I'm going to have to ask you to leave, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! What are you doing here?
Plankton: I'm here for the secret formula. [The boat turns and lands in front of Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob's houses. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs get out.] Wait here!
Mr. Krabs: And serve me dinner!
Plankton: Wait! This is ridiculous! What the...?! [He falls from the boat and is being treated at a table.] Agent Krabs! Agent Johnson!
Mr. Krabs: And then clean house. [The boat is cleaned off-screen.] And, most importantly, clean Plankton's hide. [Mr. Krabs is cleaned in the hand.] Allow me to demonstrate the most important rule of thumb when it comes to dealing with a business like ours: Always DROPBACK!
Plankton: I'm so sorry, Eugene.
