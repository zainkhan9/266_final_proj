[episode starts at the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] No, this isn't that! This is my restaurant! And no, I haven't stolen anything!
[scene cuts to Squidward sleeping at his doorstep with a phony check]
Squidward: This is the best restaurant in Bikini Bottom!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I can't possibly trusted this, Squidward. [snaps his finger] If it didn't have a phony check, [gulps] it wouldn't be here.
Squidward: You got money for nothing?
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are sitting at the counter]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: As soon as the show is over, I'm gonna sell you... [gasps] permanent change!
SpongeBob: Assignment. [gasps] So long, precious little jewel. [goes inside the kitchen where an angry Mr. Krabs is. flicks Squidward's money out of his hand]
Mr. Krabs: I'll never replace it! It is worthless now!
Squidward: Then we'll be a full restaurant and you can't buy a lawnmower and not do it!
Mr. Krabs: [angry] Oh, wait, it's me malarkey! [cries loudly and picks his teeth]
Squidward: It's not your jaw that's a problem.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah. Yeah. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Your nose is a problem. And your eyes are a problem. [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are walking around the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is trying to sell SpongeBob shoes] Come on, SpongeBob, give me some of those extra money.
Squidward: Come on, Mr. Krabs. Give me all those pennies I want!
SpongeBob: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, yeah, yeah. [walks away. SpongeBob sighs and is soon after walking into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Day 20, [gives SpongeBob some of the patties and tells him to prepare himself a Krabby Patty] is almost here.
SpongeBob: [sighs] 20 more Krabby Patties. [normal voice] Another 20 more Krabby Patties. [Mr. Krabs is about to open the door to the kitchen when a big red nose bun appears. He looks at it and then at what looks like a giant index card]
Mr. Krabs: Eh? [looks at his index card] Hmm. [Now a mustache with his nose sticking out] SpongeBob, this is your day. You've gone super-secretive, haven't you?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Greatpapal, we'd like to introduce you to our newest member.
[Francis walks up]
Francis: Hey, you can come anytime, boss. [SpongeBob pats his butt on the shoulder while he is kissing SpongeBob] Just please come back later.
Mr. Krabs: [Francesca-like] Okay, then. [Francis leaves]
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't take that hospitality, young man. It's a filthy barnacle.
SpongeBob: It is? [SpongeBob whimpers. Cut to the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is cleaning and cleaning the tables] Well, I gotta go to work today. [Mr. Krabs walks in. SpongeBob screams, runs over to the tables, and claps his hands. Cut to SpongeBob coming out with a turkey baster. He then walks into the kitchen with a turkey baster on] Well, it's been nice working here. [shows off some of the cleaning done] I can already taste the fresh meatballs. [SpongeBob grunts] The secret recipe is here. [SpongeBob jumps with a jump rope] I can already taste the meatballs. [SpongeBob jumps with a jump rope] I can already taste the Krabby...I can already taste the Krabby secret...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, this is gonna be so super boring.
SpongeBob: But I'm hungry! [Mr. Krabs hesitantly leaves]
Mr. Krabs: Good thing you went. I doubt you'll have any more leftovers after you cleaned me barn this afternoon.
SpongeBob: Oh, sir, yes, I'll be so proud of you!
