[At the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Order up! [at the grill]
Squidward: What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Do you want to order the Krabby Patty or the Krabby Patty only?
Squidward: Why, both are awful and delicious. And neither is the Krabby Patty. And neither tastes like a burger.
SpongeBob: [takes a bite out of the patty] My brain will understand! [his brain zoom out and he screams]
Mr. Krabs: What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It's a patty I made for you! [his brain screams and falls on the grill] It's made with horrible barnacle and claptra hops. [his brain screams and the patty is left on the grill]
Mr. Krabs: That's not what I meant!
SpongeBob: That's not what I meant!
Squidward: Fine... thang! [jailbreak sound. SpongeBob grabs Squidward and drags him in his office] Break the ice. [gets in the phone, opens it, and dials]
Mr. Krabs: Hello. Hello. [it was SpongeBob] Hello.
[SpongeBob drags his boss, down the stairs, which is next to the telephone]
Mr. Krabs: And this is Mr. Squidward. I just served the Krabby Patty to your table here, and it was delicious.
Squidward: What?! Why would I want to eat it? I love it! My life is a living nightmare!
[phone rings. Squidward clears his throat and shrugs. SpongeBob walks over]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Thanks for the phone.
Squidward: No, don't hang on. I hate you a little less when you're my age.
SpongeBob: All right, all right. I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not you're ready for your junkyard life to an all-out depression.
Squidward: [gets an idea] ...ScamMate!
SpongeBob: That's me, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: It's alright, SpongeBob. You just do what I say. You're allowed to do. You see, this was one of my hobbies. I was a kid again.
SpongeBob: Oh.
Squidward: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes. You see, Squidward, this was one of my hobbies back in the old navy days. I'm sure everyone in the old navy knows what a great hobby is.
Squidward: Yes.
SpongeBob: And I'm exactly who I used to be.
Squidward: Ummm...
[They both get into one of SpongeBob's yellow aerobics bicycles. They both pedal at the same time, one after the other. They pass a line of customers]
SpongeBob: What has changed your life?
Customer #2: Hey, boy, what's with the fork?
Customer #1: Oh... What the? What the? Uhh, I had it nailed to the back of the fork. [customer walks off]
Squidward: And you don't have any ketchup?
Mr. Krabs: No, but... uhh, you do.
Squidward: And why are you wearing painters tape?
Mr. Krabs: Because I fell apart! [shows customer his fork. Customer angrily walks off]
Squidward: And why is it in the bin?
Mr. Krabs: Because my legs were burning! [shows customer his bike. customer angrily walks off]
Squidward: And why is it in the trunk?
Mr. Krabs: 'Cause it's gonna break... [shows his tire] ...your back! [searches] What's the problem, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: My back? I mean, you broke your back! My back!
Squidward: And why is it in the trunk?
Mr. Krabs: Because I said it!
Squidward: And why is it in the trunk?
Mr. Krabs: Because I said it!
Patrick: [talking to Squidward] Hey, Squidward. My name is Patrick, and I love motorcycles.
Squidward: Actually, you don't.
Patrick: Don't tell me, buddy! Why don't you tell me?!
Squidward: It's for my good. Wait a minute! Patrick, what was that other thing you said?!
Patrick: It was your good name, buddy.
Squidward: Me?
