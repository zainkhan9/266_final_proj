[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in his office counting money.]
Mr. Krabs: One—two—more—fees paid.
[The money is shown and a bill comes for the customers' money. The money is shown.]
Customers: Yay!
[Mr. Krabs starts counting money.]
Mr. Krabs: One—two—more—fees paid.
Fred: [money comes out of his mouth] Money?
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles nervously] What? No, no, wait. [He shows the money to Fred] Money?
Fred: Yup. I gave it to you. [walks away]
Mr. Krabs: One—two—more—fees paid.
Fred: Yup, I gave it to you too.
[Fred gives money to Mr. Krabs. Meanwhile, Squidward is counting money at the register.]
Squidward: One—two—more—fees paid.
Fred: Yup, I paid for it all by hand.
[Fred counted money at the register. Mr. Krabs is still counting it.]
Mr. Krabs: One—two—more——fees paid.
[Squidward is confused for a long second.]
Squidward: One—two—more——fees paid.

Fred: Yup, I paid for it all by hand.

[Fred counted money at the register. Mr. Krabs is trying to think of a solution to his money-running problem.]
Mr. Krabs: Hand it on the cash register, boy. [hands Fred money] Hello, what's this?
[Fred gives Mr. Krabs a dollar and Mr. Krabs doesn't understand why he gave him a dollar. Mr. Krabs gives ino— out— but cents. Mr. Krabs cents, but when he takes them out of his pocket, everyone cheers.]
[The scene changes to Mr. Krabs working at the Krusty Krab. He is sweating and drooling like a baby. Then comes the giant hammer. It starts to slam into the wall. Everyone, is sure that Mr. Krabs is asleep, runs up to the huge hammer. When they arrived, everyone was sure that it was Krabs' fault.]
Mr. Krabs: He's too late! [shuts the entire wall] I gave the monster his first wash! [crashes into the ground and is sent flying to the top of the wall] NOOOOOO!
[Outside the Krusty Krab, the hammer's breath is seen being sucked from the giant hammer. Now, outside, Krabs is thinking clearly and could have sworn seeing a sign saying "Work".]
Mr. Krabs: [thinking] PRIMETRATION. Krabs' second-best friend. [pushes the thought bubble out of his mind] And now, he's going to create a million workaholistic burger flicks with his mind-bending mind of-wit!
[Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs' house]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you're right in the kitchen; I should be serving Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs: I'm just right in the kitchen.
SpongeBob: I've been saying for weeks that I'm in the kitchen of my mind-bending mind of-wit!
Mr. Krabs: I've seen you here before. Think fast, Krabs; I've seen you pump your fists and jiggery.
SpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs?
[SpongeBob knocks on the door of Mr. Krabs's house and Mr. Krabs answers it]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, what is it, boy?
SpongeBob: [gets out of the way] Oh, he's not real.
Mr. Krabs: I've been out there a few times now. Last week, I broke through the front door and delivered a giant-sized Krabby Patty to Patty-e for everybody to eat.
SpongeBob: [jumps out of the way] Oh, I am so hungry!
Mr. Krabs: Kick back and we'll make it worth it!
[SpongeBob continues to knock but the door keeps knocking. SpongeBob reaches for the door and gets skipped over. SpongeBob bounces around in mid-air and lands on the ground, causing his butt to ricochet off and land on the floor. SpongeBob tries to get himself or his house to stay, but his house is floating in the air. The house comes out of the ground and falls flat on the ground]
