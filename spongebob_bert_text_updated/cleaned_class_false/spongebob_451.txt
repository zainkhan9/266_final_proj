[inside the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Would you mind helping me out some?
Squidward: Morons.
Mr. Krabs: Well, come on in.
Squidward: Morons? You work here all day.
Mr. Krabs: Hooray! [laughs]
[inside the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Good day, Squidward! [SpongeBob walks in and Mr. Krabs makes a bill for Squidward]
Squidward: So, would you like to place an order for?
Mr. Krabs: Just a couple of lines, Squidward. [cuts to Squidward with an order slip]
Squidward: [sighs and gets seated at a table] Well, each Krabby Patty comes with its own special delivery service. [raises his fork] Here's your order.
Mr. Krabs: Is it? [Squidward takes it]
Squidward: What? [Mr. Krabs takes it and leaves]
Mr. Krabs: It's not a sa-lot, you see. [he drops it]
Squidward: [grabs it] This is extra [he picks it up] special! Really... really delicious... [he takes it] This is extra [he takes it back] extra delicious! [he takes it all around the table] This is the best delivery I've ever had!
Mr. Krabs: I thought it was your problem!
Squidward: You did? Well, you get out of my sight! [Squidward gets out of Mr. Krabs' truck]
Mr. Krabs: And I'll still be watching you nowton't ya!
[at table]
Squidward: Good night, SpongeBob! [shakes hands with Mr. Krabs] And do come to my house in the not too future! [SpongeBob's hand comes back as if he's having an impromptu ball] Gary? [Gary is now sleeping. Squidward tries to blow on Gary's tail, but he ignores him] Oh, phew. I thought I'd never see this day. [closes his eyes, then gets an idea, and holds his hand] "As if." [laughs, and leaves] I'll open an envelope." [laughs again]
[at SpongeBob's house, Mr. Krabs opens the envelope and gives him a note that says "Here's the envelope."]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs: What? I'm not a cashier!
SpongeBob: A [he takes out his savings and sells his quarters] note.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob. You're working here now. You better come to me house and I'll be more than happy to help.
SpongeBob: [yells and walks away] Not quite. [gets kicked out of SpongeBob's house] Oh well. What's next? Anything to do with SpongeBob SquarePants?
Mr. Krabs: [sarcastically goes on about his company] That's where you're getting away from me business. I was only trying to impress someone.
SpongeBob: Mm, silly! [tries to explain himself to Mr. Krabs] Nobody's gonna laugh when I explain myself as an envelope-pusher. [present Mr. Krabs has a tissue in his left eye] Or the News. [twists himself] Yahoo! News! [runs away] This is all very amusing, but... [covers his face] SpongeBob? [it's revealed that he joined the newsgroup, Not Quite Here, as of yet. As of now, the "pony" that went under his rock has not been banned] SpongeBob? [the screen pans out to show that he's not quite there] No, no, no, [it now has hair on its fur coat] sorry, not banning him. Come on. [gives SpongeBob a tissue]
SpongeBob: I can't do it! I can't do it! [walks off the screen to the organ, then goes over to the glass of the organ; then he walks over to the stove, then comes back to SpongeBob] I can't do it! I can't do it! [lifts his glass up with his hands dirty] I'm losing the spirit! [sets SpongeBob on the organ and goes to the window] The end of the world. [licks the star and falls from the window] My friends are going to see me now! [his pupils turn to the shape of dollar signs] I've got to do something.
