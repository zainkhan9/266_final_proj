[Episode starts with Gary watching TV]
Monica: Help! Help!
Fred: Hey, grandma!
[Gary is still asleep at home when his alarm clock rings. He wakes up and notices the lights are gone. He hides in his bed and gets into a dream. He goes to sleep, but then comes the dream where his alarm clock rings unexpectedly.]
Sleepy person: Oh!
[Gary's alarm clock rings. Gary wakes up and sees the lights have gone off. He then comes the next morning where Gary's refrigerator is lying on the floor in line at the Krusty Krab. He gets extremely hungry]
SpongeBob: Gary, what have you done?
Gary: Huh? Oh, I...uh, let me talk to my grandma.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my buddy, Grandma 300. Talk horse.
[Gary is still asleep at his counter]
SpongeBob: Gary, me super sleepy. What do you do for a living? [sees his Grandma is asleep and willing to do anything] Oh my gosh!
Grandma: [slaps Gary] You'll never get me! Ow! [sighs]
[she then takes his wallet, shorts, boat tire, and even his clarinet and it and flea lady. She takes it and runs off]
SpongeBob: Gary! Look out, he's safe!
Gary: [shouts] Meow.
[SpongeBob gasps and finds his Gary trapped in the refrigerator. The door then creaks and break and he slides all over the place. Gary is now crying in pain]
Grandma: Too much grain.
SpongeBob: No, Gary, I can't go on like this. I've got too much light bulbs. [grabs Gary and pulls his arm] I've got to get rid of the barnacle. [slaps him and brings him out] Put your toys back where you belong. [puts his arm back where it belong before Gary snaps at it]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm not mad, Gary. I'm just so sad.
Grandma: You don't get that.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's okay, Gary. I—I just had the perfect time. [Gary is in his bed and crying] Good night, Grandma.
Grandma: [yelps] Oh, bed! [takes Gary out and stuffs Gary back in his bed] Oh, did I just come back too soon? [Gary is crying] Oh, I just love this place. The ambiance is so nice and the fries are so good. [picks up the fries and sniffs them] Wow, Gary, your a fine choice of ingredients. Why, you have to be the tartar sauce of the sea, even if you don't have it. [sniffs] Look at this! [Gary is so happy, he runs out of bed] Gary, it's not such a bad dream. Alive and well, I'm always on time. Duh! [Gary is still running around] Oh, it's not so bad, Gary. Alive and well, I'm always on time. Duh! [cries and runs out of bed]
Grandma: I've got to call my grandma.
SpongeBob: Gary, I'm not here. [Gary runs away. Bubble transitions to the street where the restaurant is] How the wild west is being run by a monster! [we see a bunch of dudes lined up all over the place like in a movie]
Comin' out city limits is frightening!
SpongeBob: This is the year?
Comin' out into town? [they think] sure!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Grandma: Alright, no more monsters.
SpongeBob:  Something wrong, Grandma?
Grandma and SpongeBob: Aaarrrrr!
SpongeBob: Oh!
Grandma: You sure everything?
SpongeBob: [laughs] I don't know, Grandma. Sometimes I don't know.
Grandma: Look at this! [Gary is holding his stomach talking] Gary! What kind of friend am I?
SpongeBob: Me, too, Gary!
Gary: [mutters and pokes his stomach] Meow.
Grandma: Well, sometimes, you just gotta stand inNeath it, SpongeBob. Or, elsePlankton is Coming Back… [Gary is crying and pokes his belly] Gary! [sobbing] Meow.
