[Screen transitions to a circular black screen with the words, "Start!" said in blue and the words "Run!" said in green. The start time is 6:01.55, which is the hour the Chum Bucket changes into, and the words "Hooky!" shown. The episode opens with Patrick running through the halls of the Krusty Krab as it descends downward. He eventually stops at the Krusty Krab doors]
Patrick: Uh-oh. Uh, what's up? [notices the lights are off]
Squidward: The Krusty Krab is now in violation of our unpaid customer service code. Code violation. I want a Krabby Patty free of cost. I want it fast. I want it with good old-fashioned pickles, not pickles and onions.
Patrick: [sarcastically] Krabby Patty goodness [walks over to the cash register] Oh, oh, I'm not so sure about that.
SpongeBob: [takes the register in with him] Uh, can I get you a Krabby Patty free?
Patrick: Yeah, thanks. [leaves]
SpongeBob: But Squidward, free Krabby Patty... [Patrick takes the register in with him] Uh, isn't that great?
Patrick: Yeah, yeah, great.
Squidward: I like the idea of you guys being cheap, hey, if you could charge twice as much for your Krabby Patty as you do for all those Krabby Patties [showing them at the Krusty Krab with onions, tomatoes, and pickles]?!
SpongeBob: Yeah, that's definitely gonna drive people away.
Squidward: They probably are. [SpongeBob is shocked, and he walks away. scene cuts to SpongeBob at the register, blabbering about with his lips] I don't need a money maker! [notices the red "WELCOME HOME" sign] Huh? [notices the burnt patties] Oh, my oh-my! I must've missed it! I've got to try this Krabby Patty! [He tries it, but the spatula is stuck in the "WELCOME HOME" sign. He tries opening it up again, but the spatula is stuck in the "OPEN" sign. He pulls it out] I guess that's good enough for now. [SpongeBob tries the "WELCOME HOME" sign again, but it's not fitted into the "OPEN" sign. SpongeBob starts screaming, and Patrick starts growling at him]
Patrick: Stop! Look at what you've done!
SpongeBob: [starts growling angrily] I have had enough with your establishment! [Starts growling again, and sets up a cage with the "WELCOME HOME" sign on it] Let's go home, shall we?
Patrick: Oh, no, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [starts growling even harder] I demand you hand over the Krabby Patties to me! [He pinches his opponent's butt with his claws, making him scream. He jumps on his back and runs like a sea dog, trying to kick his opponent's butt, but he gets stuck] They're not patties.
Patrick: That's not what I meant, SpongeBob.
Squidward: Well, maybe you're right. Let's go home. [He starts to walk away, but Patrick pushes him back. He eventually does, and he gets himself stuck in the cage with the "WELCOME HOME" sign on it] Home. [He gets off his back a bit, and gets himself stuck in the cage again with the "WELCOME HOME"] But what do I care? Is this a trick? [He gets himself stuck in the cage with the "WELCOME HOME" sign on the ground] Home, home, home. [He gets himself stuck in the cage with the "WELCOME HOME"] Oh, no, wait! [He pulls himself out, and we hear Patrick laughing. We see SpongeBob walking over, very excited, and then pulls the cage a little closer to Patrick] Homecoming.
SpongeBob: You want me to go home? [walks with Patrick to the front of the stage. Patrick jumps on SpongeBob, and they get them by the noses, then they both hang onto the curtain and laugh. The song ends with Patrick and SpongeBob taking the microphone]
Patrick: Good times.
SpongeBob: Have fun, homey. Well, I'll be right back.
Patrick: Well, that's what I would've wanted to hear, had I known a little more.
