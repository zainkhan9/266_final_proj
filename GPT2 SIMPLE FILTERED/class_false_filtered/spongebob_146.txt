[SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing and playing with lots of bunny figures. SpongeBob and Patrick sit on their hammocks with their arms and legs stretched out. SpongeBob and Patrick grab the bunny figures and run after them. SpongeBob and Patrick hop onto a rock and jump over it. Then they jump down and fall on the floor.]
SpongeBob: [in a French voice] La vie... [Patrick's voice] [SpongeBob's voice] [SpongeBob knocks on it's surface] Oh, I'm coming, Patrick! I'm coming!
Patrick: Yay! [SpongeBob screams. He and SpongeBob both groan]
SpongeBob: [screams] Patrick! Whoa-hoo-hoo!
Patrick: [screams] [screams] I'm scared!
SpongeBob: I'm gonna get you!
Patrick: I'm gonna be right back!
SpongeBob: No! [Patrick is crying]
[Patrick runs after SpongeBob and SpongeBob both scream. They both go back to the hammock and run after SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob runs through a wall and falls on the ground.]
SpongeBob: [through the back door] Patrick, how come you're all alone?
Patrick: I don't know. I don't know where I'm going.
SpongeBob: Maybe you're not alone.
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: Maybe you're not alone.
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: Maybe you're not alone.
Patrick: No.
[SpongeBob runs into the living room.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, you're home!
Patrick: [screams] I'm scared!
[Patrick runs out of the kitchen, SpongeBob and Patrick run into the kitchen, and the brick wall falls down.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what have you done with the fire?
Patrick: Hmmm... [pants]
[SpongeBob lands on his head and starts crying.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, I'm so sorry. I thought you were gonna cry.
Patrick: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick walking to the bus stop and SpongeBob gets tired.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Good times again. [jumps off the bus and walks to the back of the bus] Hey, Patrick, I'm gonna help you get into the bus. [walks to the back of the bus, then the back of the bus again, then the back of the bus again, then the back of the bus again, then the back of the bus again, then the back of the bus again, then the back of the bus again, then the back of the bus again, then the back of the bus again, then the back of the bus again, then the back of the bus again, then the front of the bus, then the front of the bus again, then the front of the bus again, then the back of the bus, then the back of the bus, then the back of the bus, then the front of the bus]
[The bus drives off.]
SpongeBob: [nervously] Oh, Patrick, you're the best luck-seeker ever. You got me through the whole journey.
Patrick: [weakly] Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea you were such a luck-seer. Funny thing is, I was looking out for you all along. Well, I'll just walk you through my own...[pulls out a mirror]
[Patrick stares blankly at SpongeBob, who is in the bus stop. SpongeBob looks at the bus driver closely.]
Bus Driver: Well, if I were to pass your driver, I would be your greatest friend. Now, you must pass the bus.
SpongeBob: Okay. Now, what's the first thing you do?
Bus Driver: Well, I like to call this "the test of your abilities." [points to SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, how could I forget that?
Patrick: Oh, boy. You're my best friend now! [holds out a crudely drawn nose]
SpongeBob: Well, I...
Patrick: Oh, I have a confession to make here. I didn't draw you a crudely drawn nose.
SpongeBob: Well, what's your confession?
Patrick: Well, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I was just wondering...
Bus Driver: Don't draw me a crudely drawn nose! Oh!
Patrick: Well, I'm gonna draw a lot more of you. [draws a list of all the things he and SpongeBob can draw
