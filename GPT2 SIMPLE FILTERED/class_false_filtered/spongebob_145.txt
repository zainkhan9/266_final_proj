[On the morning of April 6, SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting in a bus stop at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick.
Patrick: [behind him] SpongeBob, I want to go pushin' out here with you.
SpongeBob: Yeah. [cuts to him at the Krusty Krab, where Squidward is booing.]
Squidward: [quietly] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Squidward, why is it that everybody in town is booing me?
Squidward: [quietly] I want to be in the Krusty Krab and everyone is booing me.
[Squidward and SpongeBob are shown in front of the doors.]
Squidward: You're great, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: But, thanks for the lift.
SpongeBob: [pulls his hat up to reveal a Krabby Patty on the other side of the door] And now, Squidward's not welcome in my establishment.
Squidward: [quietly] SpongeBob...
[Squidward's eyes go into the other direction. His mouth opens and his nose is shown.]
SpongeBob: Uhh... Squidward?
Squidward: [quietly] What are you talking about?
SpongeBob: Your employee...
Squidward: I'm talking about... you.
[Squidward is shown in a sad, sad face.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, I'm so sorry you're such a jerk.
Squidward: [quietly] No way! This isn't the end of the world!

Patrick: Well, it's called Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Oh, it's a place I've never heard of.

SpongeBob: Okay, time to take the knock.
[The doors open. SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the doors in their underwear.]
SpongeBob: Okay, if you're not wearing your underwear right now, I suggest you just wear your Krusty hat.
