[The episode begins at the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob still hears the music outside, but he is not listening. He goes to open the door and sees Squidward in a white coat and holding a key.]
SpongeBob: [through the door] Hello, Squidward. [Squidward laughs and walks off, but SpongeBob stops him.] I'm sorry. [SpongeBob turns around to see SpongeBob and Squidward outside] Squidward, you're not going anywhere.
Squidward: I can't take it anymore. This is my last chance. I need your help. [SpongeBob stands up and shows Squidward his key. Squidward laughs.]
SpongeBob: [through the door] Oh, Squidward, I'm sorry. I'm late for my little show. [Squidward gets angry.] Hey, SpongeBob, are you with me, or off? [Squidward grabs SpongeBob's arm.] Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you with me? I need my show!
[SpongeBob walks up to Squidward, who is in his bathrobe.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Where are you going?
Squidward: Oh, come on. [Squidward gets angry.] Because I'm late for your little show!
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Oh, sorry.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob holds Squidward's arm.] I'm not leaving until you're with me!
Squidward: SpongeBob, you can't give me this!
SpongeBob: [sarcastically] No way! You're my new best pal!
Squidward: You're... whoa!
SpongeBob: You're behind me all the time!
Squidward: I know! I'm the best pal! [Squidward screams and runs off]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, I'm so sorry.

[SpongeBob is in a hospital bed.]
SpongeBob: Warden, I'm on my way.
Warden: All right, SpongeBob, I'll see you at the hospital if you're not late. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Warden, please. I'm afraid you're not coming through.
Warden: All right, all right. [Warden runs out with a mallet, a needle, and a net. SpongeBob and Squidward giggle]
Squidward: Oh, I'm sorry! [Squidward gets an idea and runs off]
SpongeBob: Warden, you're late.
