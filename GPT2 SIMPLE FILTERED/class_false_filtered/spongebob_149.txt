SpongeBob: I am ready!
Mr. Krabs: Aha! Let's go! [SpongeBob walks off]
SpongeBob: You're welcome! [Mr. Krabs walks up to Squidward] You know you want to, but we always lose out on the novelty fee. [Squidward screams while SpongeBob is still walking off.

Mr. Krabs: Well, I'd like to make myself scarce for good. [walks into the Krusty Krab and takes out a bunch of dollar bills] Here you go, buddy. [walks into the kitchen]
Squidward: [screams] What?
Mr. Krabs: Two dollars.
Squidward: [screams] Mr. Krabs! How do you wanna... [Mr. Krabs throws a penny into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: I wanna put you in a place where you won't have to eat at all!
Squidward: [looks at his wallet and shrugs] I see where you're going with this.
Mr. Krabs: [holds up a knife and fork] What?! [Squidward walks into the kitchen and opens the door] What? [Squidward walks up to SpongeBob and starts making a Krabby Patty]

SpongeBob: [in the kitchen] Oh, boy! That's it! I can make you a Krabby Patty with my own hands! [hands him a knife and fork] Congratulations! You're hired!
Mr. Krabs: But you said you were the best.
SpongeBob: No. I didn't. [talks in Mr. Krabs' ear]
Mr. Krabs: Now, now, SpongeBob. How much do you want?
SpongeBob: I don't know. But I'm gonna give you a little more than the usual fee.
Mr. Krabs: You know, SpongeBob, I think this might be a good idea. [hands him a check]
