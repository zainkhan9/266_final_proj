SpongeBob: [doorbell rings] Patrick, what are you doing out here?
Patrick: [checks his watch] Oh, SpongeBob, I'm going to bed. [Patrick walks into the kitchen]
SpongeBob: That was a close one, Patrick. [Patrick walks over to some food and puts it on the grill]
Patrick: Some food! [Patrick grabs food and puts it on the spatula] Food! Food! Food! Food! [Patrick's eyes start to water] Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! [Patrick's eyes start to water again] Food!

Patrick: Yeah, yeah. [laughs] [hears this]
SpongeBob: What is it?
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob, are you coming to my house? I'm just here to meet my good friend, Patrick. [Patrick walks out of the kitchen and into the living room]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, you're late for work.
Patrick: Yeah, whatever. [Patrick walks outside and picks up a trash can]
SpongeBob: Patrick, how are you going to get out of here?
Patrick: Yeah, I'm going to go get some sleep. [Patrick walks outside to his rock, but he sees that there is no one there]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're late for work.
Patrick: Yeah, I'm sorry. I think I'm gonna be late for work. [Patrick walks up to Squidward's rock]
Squidward: Hey, SpongeBob, what're you doing?
SpongeBob: I'm going to go out and help Patrick.
Squidward: I don't have a place to go to the party.
