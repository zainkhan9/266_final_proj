[The episode starts at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is watching the TV from outside the kitchen, but he is too busy watching SpongeBob to notice Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] SpongeBob, are you in there?
SpongeBob: [gasps] I am?
Mr. Krabs: What are you saying?
SpongeBob: I am practicing for my lesson, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Okay, time for you to get used to the new surroundings. [shown through the window]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I see you're not wearing your lunch suit.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I think you'd better give it a try.
SpongeBob: [laughs] I got the hang of it. [shown through the window]
