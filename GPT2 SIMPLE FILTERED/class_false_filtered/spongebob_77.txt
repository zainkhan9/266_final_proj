Squidward: Hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Squidward. You know, we've got so much to live for. [talks through his list of what he wants to do] Now is the time to give me that wish. I'm gonna go to the moon.
SpongeBob: But I'm afraid I won't get there until I get to the moon.
Squidward: Well, I have a dream.
SpongeBob: Okay. It's gonna be so boring.
Squidward: You're right. I've got a lot of ideas.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Well, I've got a lot of ideas. [points to a bunch of ideas] But I've got one idea.
Squidward: Yeah. Don't you wanna see it?
SpongeBob: Nah, I don't wanna see it, Squidward.
Squidward: [talks through his list of what he wants to do] Now is the time to give me that wish. I'm gonna go to the moon.
