[The scene changes to have the camera roll to the right, where SpongeBob is playing with a guitar, which he slams on the ground.]
SpongeBob: I can't take it anymore! I'm stuck! [He walks off. The scene pans out to show a shot of the Krusty Krab. It is being held by the customers.]
Art SpongeBob: Hey, everybody! It's me, SpongeBob SquarePants! I'm gonna start working here!
[The scene changes to show the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is at the register.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, come on, boy! There's a little kid here who needs help.
[The customers are in shock.]
Bubble Bass: He's my friend, Gare-gare.
[The scene returns to Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, he's a lifesaver. He needs help for... [He notices a flower on the ground.] ...a strange monster! [He looks at the creature in question.] That's right! [He laughs.]
[The scene changes to show the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is holding the register up to SpongeBob.]
Mr. Krabs: [Puerto in his voice] SpongeBob, I'm gonna need a favor of yours.
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob at the register with the fish under his care.]
SpongeBob: You're welcome.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh! Oh, hey, boy! I can't wait to see your little guy.
SpongeBob: I'll be right back. [He goes to the register.] Hey, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Give me your hand. [Suddenly, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are completely tangled up. Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob's hand.] Ah, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! What are you doing?
SpongeBob: I'm waiting for someone. [Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob out of the way.] They're not coming! [Mr. Krabs runs away.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Hold on! [SpongeBob is still tangled up.] Hold on!
[SpongeBob is tangled up again.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy-o. I'll take you up on that. [He runs out of the kitchen. SpongeBob is tangled up again.] SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs runs to the bathroom.] Hey, Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're in trouble! You're not gonna help me anymore! [He runs off. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs.] Mr. Krabs, your shift's over.
SpongeBob: [Talking] Thank you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [Breathing heavily] What a nice day.
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Mr. Krabs? You mean you're not taking me job anymore?
Mr. Krabs: What I need is a replacement for when I'm gone.
SpongeBob: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'd better start looking for someone who's not just a jerk, but a real jerk.
Mr. Krabs: Sure thing, SpongeBob. What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: All I do is babysit.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah? What happened to your babysitting, buddy?
SpongeBob: [Laughs] I've got to go get my hair cut. [Mr. Krabs pulls SpongeBob out of the way.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're on the lam.
SpongeBob: Well, I gotta go babysit for my little angel. [He strokes his rock.]
Mr. Krabs: First thing tomorrow morning.
SpongeBob: [Laughs] Hey, Mr. Krabs! I think I've got you covered.
Mr. Krabs: [Flips paper over and over] Well, you're not coming down tomorrow.
