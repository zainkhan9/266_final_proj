<Start Ep> [SpongeBob and Patrick stand up and wave as the sun rises in the west. SpongeBob and Patrick scream as the wind blows them back in time. SpongeBob and Patrick point at each other.]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen] I got a surprise for you, pal. [Patrick points]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, I'm sorry. I thought you were the one who said we need a giant clarinet.
Patrick: Can I get one?
SpongeBob: No, no, Patrick. I'm sorry. I can't take it off.
Patrick: But I'll take it off. [lifts SpongeBob's arms]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, I'm not gonna take it off. I'm gonna call the cops.
Patrick: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [SpongeBob runs off-screen with Patrick holding his nose]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're alive! I'll save you!
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, I don't think so.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, you're not alive! I'm gonna save you! [cries]
Patrick: SpongeBob, why are you still alive?
SpongeBob: I'm gonna save you, pal. I'm gonna save you! [fade to black]
