<Start Ep> Hello, everyone! This episode is all about your phone, and your mail.
Squidward: What?!
SpongeBob: I got a good feeling that I'd get this one. [They walk past Squidward and SpongeBob's house]
Squidward: SpongeBob! You're here! [At the SpongeBob's house, Squidward hears a noise]
SpongeBob: [He enters the house and sees SpongeBob and Squidward inside] Huh?
Squidward: Look, SpongeBob, I'll help you! [Patrick is putting a stack of envelopes in the sink]
Patrick: [Meanwhile, Squidward is in the bathroom washing the soap. Squidward notices SpongeBob and Squidward. They both glare at each other]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you're dressed up in a cute little pink outfit.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, never mind. [Squidward is sitting on a bench with a blue dress shirt and a white tuxedo. Squidward's head starts to throb]
Squidward: Wait a minute. [Squidward is doing pushups and jacks and is already doing a lot of jumping. He walks up to SpongeBob and Squidward, who are in their chairs] Howdy, Squidward, are you doing, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Well, it looks like you've got a lot of work to do, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh, boy. I wonder how long I'm gonna be stuck in here.
SpongeBob: [Sitting in a chair] Squidward, what are you doing here?
Squidward: [Walking to SpongeBob] I'm following you, SpongeBob, to the door.
SpongeBob: [As Squidward walks in the room, SpongeBob starts to walk in an extremely fast pace] Coming, SpongeBob! [The two begin to argue]
Squidward: Please, SpongeBob. It's no use arguing with me. I'm just here to watch you do pushups and jacks. [Squidward starts to sweat and cough] It's time to get you fixed.
SpongeBob: [walks in] Squidward, SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
Squidward: [Off-screen] Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Squidward, where are you?
Squidward: I'm here to watch you do pushups and jacks. [Squidward starts to sweat and cough] It's time to get you fixed.
SpongeBob: [Walks in the kitchen] Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: [Off-screen] Saving money on new clothes. Don't you mind?
Squidward: This is all just a misunderstanding.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Squidward: I'd like to make a number one request.
SpongeBob: Are you trying to make a joke?
Squidward: No.
SpongeBob: Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. How about two? [SpongeBob chuckles]
Squidward: [Off-screen] No, not two.
SpongeBob: Okay.
Squidward: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. [Squidward starts to sweat and cough]
SpongeBob: Okay, okay. [Squidward walks up to a table]
Squidward: Are you ready for your jiggy-combo?
SpongeBob: You're not ready, Squidward. You're not ready today. [Squidward starts to sweat and cough]
Squidward: What? What? [Squidward's sweat and cough starts to cloud his vision]
SpongeBob: Okay, you're ready, Squidward. You're ready today. [Squidward's sweat and cough stops]
Squidward: No, no, no, you're not.
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, uhh, okay. [Squidward's sweat and cough stops]
