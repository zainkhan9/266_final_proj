SpongeBob: Gasoline?
Squidward: Yes, Gasoline.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, no, you've got to take a break. It's a little relaxing.
Squidward: Oh, no. I'm sorry, SpongeBob. [Squidward turns off the gas. SpongeBob shakes Squidward.] If I could get Squidward to take a break, I would, but he's too busy working at the Krusty Krab to do it right.
SpongeBob: Well, you're right, Squidward. I can't do anything right.
Squidward: What's wrong with Squidward?
SpongeBob: I've got a confession to make. I've got a confession to tell.
Squidward: I said, "If I could do nothing right, I'd do it right." [notices a stick of dynamite behind SpongeBob and gasps] Oh, you're right. I can't do anything right. I'm not gonna go near this thing!
SpongeBob: That's not what I said! [gasps] It's not okay! [gasps again] Go away! [gasps again] I don't want to do this! [gasps again] I'm not gonna go near it! [gasps again] Wait! [gasps again] Wait!

[gasps again] Wait! [gasps again] Wait! [gasps again] Oh, no! I'm not gonna go near it! [gasps again] Wait!
