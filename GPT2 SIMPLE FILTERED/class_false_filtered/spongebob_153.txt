SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick.
Patrick: [offscreen] Oh, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob is in the kitchen] What's this? [SpongeBob is frying a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: It's a fancy dress here, isn't it? [cut to SpongeBob in the kitchen, wearing fancy dress clothes] I'm the chef. I've never seen anything like it. [cut to SpongeBob at the register, still wearing fancy dress clothes and talking in a French accent] Looks like you're gonna make it. [SpongeBob pulls out an apple] It's a beautiful morning in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, that's nice, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, yeah, it's nice to be home.
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick. I got a better idea. [Patrick walks up and SpongeBob notices him]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
