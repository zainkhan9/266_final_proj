[The scene shows the two at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is standing in front of the door with the tub filter and the grill on top of him.]
SpongeBob: [muffled] I'm quiet. What's going on?
[He is shown walking to the Krusty Krab with the grill on his head.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Why did you come to the Krusty Krab?
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob and Patrick. They both scream.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [sighs] Patrick, you're right. We were just out of food. There's got to be a way to make Krabby Patties just like the customers.
[Patrick starts to climb up SpongeBob's bed.]
Patrick: Just follow me!
[SpongeBob walks into the kitchen and Patrick starts to eat his own Krabby Patties. The scene changes to show Squidward.]
Squidward: [still in the kitchen] What the barnacle is going on here?
[Squidward pulls out a metal detector in the kitchen. He digs into the kitchen and picks up Squidward's stuff.]
Squidward: What?
[Squidward looks through the metal detector and sees SpongeBob inside of his shell.]
Squidward: What's that?
[Squidward gets dressed up like SpongeBob and takes out a remote.]
Squidward: You want to know what's going on in there?
SpongeBob: [off-screen] I'm in there, Squidward.
Squidward: That's what?
SpongeBob: It's a pretty convincing explanation, Squidward.
[The scene returns to Squidward. He looks through the metal detector and sees that the Krabby Patty formula is still there. Squidward turns around.]
Squidward: [yelling at SpongeBob] You want me to stop?
SpongeBob: No, you want me to stop! I'm hungry!
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob with two smaller snacks inside of his shell. The scene changes to show Squidward sitting on a couch looking at the TV.]
Squidward: [sighs] As if I couldn't get any worse.
[The scene returns to Squidward and SpongeBob.]
Squidward: And here's your second snack.
[The scene returns to Squidward.]
Squidward: [sighs] I'm hungry!
[The scene changes to show Squidward at the Krusty Krab. The screen shows Squidward outside the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: [screams] Just how pathetic is your pathetic attempt to sneak in? [He gets in the restaurant and runs out of the building]
SpongeBob: Look, Squidward, you've made your escape.
Squidward: [gasps] SpongeBob, I'm not here! Why are you so scared?
SpongeBob: You know, Squidward, I have never felt so alone.
Squidward: [gives SpongeBob his hat] You've been a nice neighbor, but you haven't been kind to me.
SpongeBob: Squidward, that was a very good neighbor.
Squidward: Well, that doesn't mean he doesn't have a lot of things in common.
SpongeBob: I have to admit, Squidward, I'm a bit of a SpongeBob. I like to keep to myself.
Squidward: I suppose you're right. I shouldn't be in such a position.
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob at the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward!
[SpongeBob and Squidward are shown sitting at an establishment.]
Squidward: What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Well, it's not that I'm not into you, but I'm not into you enough to be in this job. I just don't feel comfortable around you guys.
Squidward: Well, we've got a lot of other things in common.
SpongeBob: [talks through the megaphone] I'm your new manager!
Squidward: But you're my new manager and my job is to make sure you're happy.
SpongeBob: I'm happy to be here.
Squidward: I'm happy to be here.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! What are you doing here?
Squidward: I'm here to make sure you're happy.
SpongeBob: I'm here for the fish food.
Squidward: And I'm here to make sure you're happy.
SpongeBob: And I'm here to make
