<Start Ep> [Squidward, Patrick, and Gary are all there]
Squidward: SpongeBob, tell them to shut up. [Squidward, Patrick, and Gary continue to talk in a low voice]
SpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward. We're just not feeling well. [Squidward, Patrick, and Gary are all there]
Squidward: I'm just gonna save you.
SpongeBob: [chortling] Did you hear that? Squidward, I'm gonna save you! [Squidward, Patrick, and Gary still talking in a low voice]
Squidward: SpongeBob, can you believe it? Squidward, I'm gonna save you!
SpongeBob: I'm gonna save you, Squidward! [Squidward screams]
Squidward: SpongeBob, how could you?! I'm saved!
SpongeBob: Squidward, why?
Squidward: [exclaiming] I'm saved!
SpongeBob: Now, Squidward, why don't you just keep driving?
Squidward: I won't let you let me down! I'll be back soon. [Gary walks up to Squidward] Gary, I'm gonna save you! [Squidward screams]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: [laughs]
[Squidward drove up to Squidward's house, where Squidward and SpongeBob were playing a game of rock and roll. Squidward plays the rock rock and rolls on the floor.]
Squidward: [dancing and singing] Yes?
[Squidward and SpongeBob laugh. Squidward slides down the bed and puts his blanket on him. Squidward's eyes turn to the floor and his eyes widen in shock.]
Squidward: I'm not gonna let ya go! You're gonna have to stay here like a prisoner, remember?
[Squidward laughs and the ceiling cracks like he's having a seizure. Squidward's eyes pop back to normal and he screams. Squidward screams even more and Squidward falls over. Squidward gets up, puts his blanket over his head, and starts to walk away.]
Squidward: [enters his house and the wind blows Squidward inside. Squidward screams as the door opens and SpongeBob walks in.]
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What's the matter SpongeBob?
Squidward: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry to say that you've been a real jerk to me and my tartar sauce. You know, I've been a real jerk to Patrick, too, you know?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, you weren't just a little tartar sauce on my bucket of rocks, were you?
Squidward: [happily] Not really. [starts to sob] And you know what else? There's the time, [falls asleep] and there's the opportunity, and I'm gonna...
[Squidward wakes up, but his alarm goes off. Squidward slaps his head and groans. Squidward screams.]
Squidward: [in a sad voice]You're fired!
SpongeBob: No, Squidward, there's no way I'm gonna let you go like this!
[SpongeBob pulls out a tape measure and drills a hole in the floor. Then he goes to jack the jack with a jackhammer, but it sticks and he falls asleep. The jack machine comes and jack opens and the machine shows that Squidward is sleeping. The jack machine pulls Squidward out and puts him under a blanket.]
Squidward: [panting] SpongeBob! I'm not gonna let you go! [Squidward's eyes turn into hearts and his eyes become hearts]
SpongeBob: Good night, Squidward. I promise you'll be safe in me safe place.
[SpongeBob pulls the shell off his head, revealing that it's actually his head. The shell flings Squidward into his bed.]
Squidward: That's right, SpongeBob. I'm gonna be safe here tonight. We'll be in my safe place under that blanket. And then I...and then...
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Oh, Squidward. I'm sorry to say it. I don't deserve this. I didn't deserve this. I deserve to be in this place all this time. I deserve to have my bed here.
Squidward: [reenters his room and closes the door] Oh.
SpongeBob: Hey, you're not gonna have to live like this anymore.
Squidward: But I'll
