<Start Ep> [Starts at the Krusty Krab with a Krabby Patty and fries] Here ya are, boy! [He starts to eat the patty but then he gets his head stuck in the patty] Whew.
Mr. Krabs: [turns pink] Krabby Patty, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: [stops at a distance from the Krusty Krab] What do you want, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I don't know. I think I just want some fries.
SpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I got you now, boy!
Mr. Krabs: I'll have some here. [His eyes turn into a camera and start to shoot] Pearly! Pearly! Pearly!
SpongeBob: Well, I'm not hungry.
Mr. Krabs: I'm sorry. I just can't afford the fries.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I'm saving up to get the Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: No, no, I can't have that! [SpongeBob takes the patty] It's my lucky gift!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy. You really don't get to eat at the Krusty Krab without that.
Mr. Krabs: Huh.
[Mr. Krabs puts the patty on the table]
SpongeBob: Good thing he touched it. C'mon, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Let me give you the lucky gift of a Krabby Patty. [He opens the door and SpongeBob is there with a Krabby Patty] Thank you, pal. You really did outsmart me this time.
SpongeBob: Why, thank you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, the Krusty Krab is the best place to be without a family member to eat at.
SpongeBob: [pats the patty] Aww, thank you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, okay. Next. [Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk over to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] I'm here, sir. First, I want to make sure you all have a good time.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boy. I have to go home early.
SpongeBob: Oh, I know, sir. Please, please, don't go out that way.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, I'm glad that's over.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk into the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [high voice, with a mustache] Enough of this nonsense! First, I want to make sure everyone has a good time.
