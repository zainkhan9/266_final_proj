SpongeBob: [gasps] My house! My house! My house! My house!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk up to their house with a package. Inside, there's the package with a picture of SpongeBob on it.]
SpongeBob: My secret package...
[SpongeBob's house is searched again.]
SpongeBob: No, my secret...
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs return with a package with a picture of SpongeBob on it.]
Mr. Krabs: Hi, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Hello?
[Mr. Krabs sniffs the air and smells the air. He puts the package in SpongeBob's mouth.]
SpongeBob: Hello, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? [bubble transition to him, SpongeBob, and Mr. Krabs inside SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Oh, well. I suppose you two seemed kind of... [SpongeBob sees a bunch of pictures and a picture of SpongeBob] Right. [SpongeBob's house is searched again.]
SpongeBob: [gets hit in the face by a can of soda] Ow!
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Oh, that's what my best friend said.
Mr. Krabs: [goes into SpongeBob's house] Heh, heh, heh.
Mr. Krabs: [his eye tears up at SpongeBob's house] Oh, it's okay. We can play with the toys. [SpongeBob goes in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Oh, wait a minute. That's my best friend.
Mr. Krabs: No, wait. Nobody's best friend.
SpongeBob: Oh, well. I guess I'll try the things.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, wait a second. It's really not that bad.
SpongeBob: Never mind. I've got a really good idea. [walks out of the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm sorry I ruined your best friend's day. I'll have to call the police.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry you ruined my day.
Mr. Krabs: That's okay. Just try to forget about it.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I know you're upset with me, but I just don't know why that man would upset you all by making this whole thing up.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I won't go in there and say, 'Hey, boy-o, feel me. I know you're upset with me, but I just don't know why you'd upset me all that much.
SpongeBob: But you're my best friend. [Mr. Krabs comes out of the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boy, look at you, SpongeBob. You look like you've never been this upset before.
SpongeBob: Why would I upset you?
Mr. Krabs: Well, because you told me your secret. [walks out of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Where was I?
Mr. Krabs: It was that time of day, where everybody talks about you.
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: I said I didn't like your secret.
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: I said I don't know why you'd upset me all that much.
SpongeBob: But you're my best friend.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boy, look at you. You look like you've never been this upset before.
SpongeBob: You were?
Mr. Krabs: Yes, that's right. I said I'm your best friend. [walks out of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy, I'm so sorry.
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs look at each other and get very angry.]
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Krabs. I'm not upset. I'm just upset.
Mr. Krabs: What?
SpongeBob: You said I wouldn't listen to you, and you said I'm supposed to be your best friend.
Mr. Krabs: Oh... I don't listen to you, boy-o.
SpongeBob: I didn't say I'm your best
