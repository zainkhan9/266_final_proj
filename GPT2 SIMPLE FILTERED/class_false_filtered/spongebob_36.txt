Narrator: And just as Patrick and SpongeBob were about to put on their midnight hijinks, they heard a crashing noise.
SpongeBob: Patrick, where are you?
Patrick: I'm not in the boat.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you can't be in here!
Patrick: I'm in here!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you don't understand! This is happening all over Bikini Bottom!
Patrick: Look, it's my boat!
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're crazy! Why, you're lying to me!
Patrick: I'm not lying to ya! I'm lying to you!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. I'm gonna get in the boat and get out of here!
Patrick: Now that I'm in the boat, I'm gonna get out of here!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's time to leave.
Patrick: Leave me! [holds up the boat, which is a small-powered machine gun]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what do you want?
Patrick: I don't know. I don't want to go anywhere. [pushes SpongeBob out of the boat]
SpongeBob: I don't wanna go anywhere!
Patrick: [stops the boat] Hmmm... [pushes the boat back inside] I'll just take you to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: [gasps as he sees a sign that says "Krusty Krab"] I'll take you there, Patrick, but I'll need some help.
Patrick: I don't know how I'm gonna do this, SpongeBob. I've got a lot of problems that I'm gonna have to solve.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm not gonna do that. I have a lot of problems that I'm gonna have to solve...
Patrick: [pushes SpongeBob out of the boat] Well, I have a lot of problems that I'm gonna have to solve.
SpongeBob: Well, what I want is for you to have a good time.
Patrick: [laughs] Yeah.
SpongeBob: [sits on the seat next to Patrick] Let me show you how to make a Krabby Patty.
Patrick: Wow!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Patrick, it's so easy.
Patrick: Oh, I don't know! I've got lots of things I'd like to see here!
SpongeBob: I know. Here's your patty.
Patrick: [holds up SpongeBob's underwear] Here's your underwear. [holds up his spatula] Here's your spatula. [holds it up high] Here's your spatula. [holds it up low] Here's your spatula. [holds it up wide] Here's your spatula. [holds it up high]
SpongeBob: Here's your spatula.
Patrick: Here's your spatula.
SpongeBob: Here's your spatula. [Patrick holds up his spatula] Here's your spatula. [Patrick holds up his spatula] Here's your spatula. [Patrick holds up his spatula and sticks it into SpongeBob's mouth]
SpongeBob: That's it! I got you now!
Patrick: Thanks! I'll never get this job. [walks away]
SpongeBob: Patrick, your boat is gone.
Patrick: [picks up the boat] Oh, SpongeBob, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
