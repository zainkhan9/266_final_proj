[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab where Squidward enters his office]
Squidward: Excuse me, sir. I am writing to ask about your latest customer.
Mr. Krabs: What?
Squidward: What are you doing here, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I'll suggest your suspicion.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Krabs and I are having a customer strike.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: We want your Krabby Patty to be as good as his heart.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: I don't think you can make this job more boring.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: I don't think you can make this job more exciting.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: I think you're making this a lot more expensive.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: I don't think we can ever make this job more exciting.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: I think... [Bubble transition to Mr. Krabs making a note of his health] You make me a dollar. [Mr. Krabs' eyes opens and a dollar comes out] A dollar! [Mr. Krabs screams as his dollar falls on Squidward's head]
Squidward: Oh, no, no, no, no, Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs cowers in fear while Squidward's eyes flutter open. Mr. Krabs gazes out the window as Squidward is having a seizure on the floor. He pulls Squidward off the floor with his tentacles, while Mr. Krabs wraps him in a package. Squidward's eyes fall open wide and his head pops out. Squidward is now at the hospital. He is in a bed with a bandage over his head and is having a seizure on the floor.]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, what a beautiful day it is.
[Mr. Krabs drags a doctor out of the hospital.]
Doctor: Adios, Squidward!
Squidward: Doctor, I think that you'd better go to your doctor.
Doctor: Oh, I'll be coming to my office immediately. [They walk out of the hospital, and Squidward walks in]
Squidward: [He is shocked to see doctors who don't know about Squidward's seizure.] Oh, hi, doctor.
Doctor: Ooh! My name is Doctor H.
Squidward: Oh, thank you. The doctors know everything I know, so I'm gonna need a trip to my office.
Doctor: Oh, what is it?
Squidward: Huh, no. [Doctor opens a tray and puts a handful of medicine into it] The medicine I need is a trip to my office.
Doctor: Oh. Nurse?
Squidward: [hears a noise in the distance] What? I'm out of medicine.
Doctor: Wait a second. What's that?
Squidward: [hears a different thought] Nurse!
Doctor: [reaches in the tray] Oh, sorry. I just need a trip to my office.
Squidward: Nurse!
Doctor: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling well. [points to his head]
Squidward: Well, I don't see how this can't be good.
Doctor: Oh, well.
Squidward: [pulls out a clipboard] Here's your trip plan.
Doctor: Oh, uh, yeah.
Squidward: [hears the news] What the...?
Doctor: Well, uh, I'm trying to write a letter to the president.
Squidward: Ooh, excellent idea!
Doctor: You're in my office now, too. [Squidward sits on his desk and writes a letter of resignation]
Squidward: Oh, I'm gonna write an open letter to the president. [He opens the letter] Under oath.
Dr. Parrot: [Showing Squidward's face with a laugh and an "O" on it.] 1. What is your name?
Squidward: Dr. Parrot.
Dr. Parrot: Oh, I'd like to propose a simple question: what is your name?
Squidward: [hears a conversation on the other side] "What?"
[Squidward's mouth opens and he sees a picture of SpongeBob on the wall. He laughs and goes into the picture. Squidward turns to see SpongeBob in a hospital bed with the name tag still on it.]
Squidward: [He hears a knock on the door.] What the...?
