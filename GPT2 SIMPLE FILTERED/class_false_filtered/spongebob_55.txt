SpongeBob: Sandy's here.
Sandy: [sitting at a picnic table, staring at a picture of SpongeBob with an extremely realistic face] Oh, my gosh. [SpongeBob stares blankly. Sandy stops and sips some of the lemonade]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, look! [Sandy's head is shaped like a heart, and the heart is SpongeBob's head as well. Sandy steps away from the picture and looks up at SpongeBob] I can see your eyes, Sandy. They're sparkling. [Sandy's eyes are surrounded by a very fine gold plating.]
Sandy: Eh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Look, Sandy, I'm in love with you.
Sandy: Oh, SpongeBob, I can't wait to see what your life is like when you're with me.
SpongeBob: [gasps] I'm ready.
Sandy: Let me take this.
SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy, this is the most realistic look I've ever seen.
Sandy: All right, all right. Here's your realistic face.
SpongeBob: Sandy...
Sandy: Sandy, no! [sighs]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait! I'm sorry. I'm sorry you've ruined my look!
Sandy: Oh, SpongeBob, you're right. You should have used a different name.
SpongeBob: [looks at the picture of him with an extremely realistic face] Hey, Sandy, look at that. You look a lot younger.
Sandy: All right! [the picture of SpongeBob with an extremely realistic face turns into a picture of a realistic shark]
SpongeBob: Who's that?
Sandy: That's me. I'm Sandy Cheeks, owner and operator of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Mermaid Tooth. I'm here to see if you'd be interested in taking my look and help me get my teeth fixed. [now Sandy is wearing a bikini, and SpongeBob is on top of her] Tell me more! [SpongeBob looks sad] Sandy, are you with me? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm not sure I'm gonna come back. I've got a lot of other things to do. But I'm gonna get to the bottom of this matter.
SpongeBob: What are you doing?
Sandy: I'm here to see if you'd be interested in taking my look.
SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy, I gotta say that's a lot of relief.
Sandy: [through a megaphone] You're real good, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, if I were you, I wouldn't take that look. But you don't have to. I'm just here to see if you'd be interested in my Mermaid Tooth.
Sandy: Oh, okay. I'll save you. [SpongeBob pulls out a mirror. He looks like a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. SpongeBob smiles]
SpongeBob: You're in.
Sandy: [through a megaphone] Oh! I'll save you! I'm in! Oh-kay! [she stops the Mermaid Man Mermaid Tooth. SpongeBob looks sad]
SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy. You're not in anymore.
Sandy: Oh, I'm sorry. I know how to save you, SpongeBob. I'm so sorry I'm not wearing my Mermaid Man Mermaid Tooth anymore. I hope you can at least take this look. [puts Mermaid Man Mermaid Tooth on Sandy's mouth] I'm so sorry I'm not wearing my new Mermaid Man Mermaid Tooth. [SpongeBob looks like a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. SpongeBob and Sandy laugh]
SpongeBob: Sandy, you look a lot older.
Sandy: Oh, SpongeBob, thanks. [she stops the Mermaid Man Mermaid Tooth, SpongeBob looks a lot older. Sandy sighs]
SpongeBob: Sandy, you look a lot younger.
Sandy: I'm sorry, SpongeBob, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
SpongeBob: [Sandy smiles] Sandy, you look a lot younger.
Sandy: Oh, SpongeBob. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
SpongeBob: [screams] Sandy, what are you gonna do?
Sandy: I'm gonna protect my job and my money.
SpongeBob: [screams] Sandy, what are you gonna do?
Sandy: SpongeBob, I'm gonna protect my
