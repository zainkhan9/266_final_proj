<Start Ep> [Episode 1]
SpongeBob: Squidward, it's really getting to the point where you need assistance.
Squidward: Why, yes I do. I've been in this situation before and I know it's only getting worse.
SpongeBob: [chuckles] Well, as you all know, we all need help...
Squidward: Please, I'm late for work. [SpongeBob and Squidward walk out, accompanied by Squidward's mother]
Mother: [off-screen] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What's your mom like?
Mother: [off-screen] Hello.
SpongeBob: Oh, sister. We're having a brainstorming meeting.
Squidward: And now, your mom is going to be on the case.
Mother: [off-screen] Ya know, I think I can handle this.
SpongeBob: My mom is a genius.
Squidward: Oh, okay. Alright, bye. [Squidward walks away, his wig on, and SpongeBob and Squidward both laugh]
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. But what about your dad?
Squidward: I don't have dad, but I did receive a letter from my mom. It says that my dad's 'Help Wanted' letter says that he's in the hospital.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, that's right! Your dad's in the hospital!
Squidward: You can't just send out a letter like that.
SpongeBob: But, Squidward, it's the truth.
Squidward: Well, no one would ever lie to me like that!
SpongeBob: Why, yes! It's exactly what you would expect from a family friend.
Squidward: Well, I was just coming to terms with the fact that my dad wasn't going anywhere.
SpongeBob: That's true.
Squidward: Well, you see, SpongeBob, you're kind of on your own two pronged path.
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward, it's not like my dad is in any danger.
Squidward: But I have to inform you that my dad is in the hospital for observation.
SpongeBob: Yes, that's right.
Squidward: Can you be more precise?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, his condition is very serious.
Squidward: What are you gonna do today?
SpongeBob: I don't know.
Squidward: Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'm sure you'll come up with an explanation.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm not sure what you're gonna do today, Squidward. But I'm sure I'll come up with something cool to help.
Squidward: That's right, SpongeBob. I've got something really cool to bring you. Something so cool that it makes you want to cry.
SpongeBob: Really?
Squidward: Really. Let me show you something cool.
SpongeBob: Oh, this is the thing. The thing that makes Squidward so happy.
Squidward: Really?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Something that makes him want to cry.
SpongeBob: Let's see what that is.
Squidward: Huh?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, I'm glad you like that idea.
