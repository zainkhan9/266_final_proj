SpongeBob: [reading to his friend Gary] Good morning, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [Gary's voice is hoarse] Okay, Gary, I'm tired of the stupid, boring, and lame SpongeBob SquarePants show. I'm going to get cranky. [Gary runs up to SpongeBob in a ball of fire and sits on the couch] Gary, I know I want to. [SpongeBob turns his head to see his friend sitting on a chair with a light bulb in his hand] I know it's not all that easy, but I'm ready. I'm ready. [Gary walks up to SpongeBob] Gary!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Hey, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob's eyes became bloodshot] Gary! You look sad! I hope that you're feeling better today. [Gary walks away]
SpongeBob: Gary, I know what you're thinking. You're jealous. You've been having so much fun that you've stopped being yourself, and you don't want to be seen as a loser anymore.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You don't understand. You've lost all of your friends. Now you're gonna be the best friend ever! [SpongeBob imagines Gary as a nickel]
Gary: Meow, meow, meow!
SpongeBob: [Gary jumps off the couch and runs away] Gary! You're the best friend ever!
Gary: Meow, meow, meow!
SpongeBob: [Gary runs off, back into the house, and runs back into the wall] I'm going to save you, Gary. [Gary runs behind the curtain] Sorry, Gary. I think I found my nemesis. [SpongeBob walks up to a TV with a bunch of people watching it]
