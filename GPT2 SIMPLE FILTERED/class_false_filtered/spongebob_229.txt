[SpongeBob and Patrick are now sitting on top of the Krusty Krab.]
SpongeBob: [stops eating] Patrick, I've got to go. I'm late for my lunch break. [closes refrigerator] Why, I've got to take it easy. [enters kitchen]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing with your allowance?
Patrick: I'm having so much fun.
[SpongeBob opens the fridge and catches a whiff of a whiff of the stale Krabby Patty. He grumbles and rips the patty apart.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I don't care. I'm just having so much fun.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are having a great time playing with their sticks.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, you're a great player.
Patrick: [giggles] That's right. I'm having so much fun. [coughs] Patrick, I'm not.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are having a great time playing with their sticks.]
SpongeBob: Oh, isn't it great?
Patrick: Yeah. It's so relaxing. [giggles]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, don't worry. I'm sure you'll find that out in the end. [Patrick shoves SpongeBob and Patrick away, disappointed with himself. SpongeBob is shocked at how easy it is for Patrick to lose.]
Patrick: Now, let's play roulette.
[The two play roulette on the stick called "P" which is also a real stick with real hands. Patrick shakes his head and chuckles.]
Patrick: Oh, this game's easy enough. Now, let's have some fun.
[SpongeBob and Patrick are playing against each other with their sticks.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Patrick, I thought you played roulette.
Patrick: Yeah, I did.
SpongeBob: Oh, well, we've got to find out who's right.
[SpongeBob and Patrick dive into an illegal spot on the stick called "Sand." Sand gets in the way of the two playing.]
Patrick: Okay, SpongeBob! Now, let's go! [giggles]
SpongeBob: [crying] Patrick, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Patrick: Okay, SpongeBob, just one more thing.
SpongeBob: [whispers] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Patrick: Okay, okay!
[SpongeBob and Patrick grab onto each other's sticks and start sliding.]
Patrick: Okay, okay!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are sliding on their sticks. Patrick's stick is still moving, but SpongeBob's is sliding faster. They're both getting closer and closer.]
SpongeBob: I'm so sorry!
Patrick: Okay, okay!
[The two continue to slide on their sticks. Patrick's stick falls on SpongeBob's.]
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob and Patrick continue to slide on their sticks, but become very tired after having to slide on their sticks all day.]
SpongeBob: [laughing] Patrick, we're just gonna get some rest.
Patrick: You're right.
