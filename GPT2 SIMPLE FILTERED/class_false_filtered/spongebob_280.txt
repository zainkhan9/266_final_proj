SpongeBob: By the way, SpongeBob, I'm gonna miss you.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob standing next to a trashcan]
Patrick: Wow, you really liked my show last week.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, I don't feel like I've ever been to a "Best Friends Ever" reunion.
Patrick: Uhh, I've never been to a "Best Friends Ever" reunion.
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, having been in "best friends ever," when you guys are in "best friends ever," you're in a lot of trouble.
Patrick: Oh, thanks, SpongeBob! I'm glad I'm here.
[Patrick looks at the trashcan. He notices some things on it]
Patrick: [with a cup of coffee] This is the best Friends Ever!
SpongeBob: What are you talking about?
Patrick: It's a very important secret.

Patrick: I don't know what to do.

SpongeBob: You know what? I'm gonna miss you more.
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: I don't wanna do anything.
Patrick: I don't wanna do anything either.
SpongeBob: Well, what do you say we move to a new town?
Patrick: Well, to move to a new town is to move back.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, it's actually quite a move.
Patrick: Yeah, I've got a house, I've got a boat, I've got a pet bunny, I've got a lima-buzzah, I've got a movie theater, I've got a little movie theater set, I've got my own theater, and now, I'm moving.
SpongeBob: Yeah, all this new stuff, and we're gonna live in a completely different town.
Patrick: Yeah!
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk into a hole they saw growing]
Patrick: So, you're telling me your new town is, like, "Blinging!"

SpongeBob: [while walking to the "Best Friends Ever" reunion] Hey, you guys! What's the best friend for you and me?
Patrick: I don't know, I don't wanna talk about it.
SpongeBob: I wanna be friends with my best friend!
