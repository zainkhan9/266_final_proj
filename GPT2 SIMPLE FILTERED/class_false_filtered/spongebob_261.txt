[SpongeBuck pulls out a pen and paper.]
Squidward: SpongeBuck, I don't know how you're gonna come to a good, clean, and happy place like this.
SpongeBuck: Oh, I'm a little bit worried. I've got to be more careful.
Squidward: I'm not worried. I don't need you to keep me busy. I already got the perfect outfit for my special occasion. [shows his outfit]
SpongeBuck: Well, I don't think I can handle all this stuff, do I?
Squidward: Aww, but you two are just starting out. I don't need to remind you.
SpongeBuck: No, no, no, no, no, no. [meanwhile, Squidward is having a chat with Patrick.]
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBuck. I'm wondering if you'd like to join my club.
SpongeBuck: Sure! In your club, I mean.
Patrick: Are you a member?
SpongeBuck: Sure! [takes out a blue club membership card.]
Patrick: Nerd club membership card!
SpongeBuck: Well, it's a little smaller than your regular membership card, but you are a member. I'm gonna take you on a trip of my own creation and meet some of my very own friends.
Patrick: Oh, I already have a club card.
SpongeBuck: Okay, okay, I'll get you on board.
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBuck: Okay.
Patrick: And be sure to bring your own
