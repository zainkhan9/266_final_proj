<Start Ep> [1.00]
SpongeBob: [on television] Oh, gee, Sandy, I don't think it's a secret that SpongeBob is not one for the details, either. He comes in every day, and he's always rocking a karavel. [shows a picture of SpongeBob with the words "Krabby Patties" on it and SpongeBob's face on it] But I do know one thing: He's the nicest guy I ever met.
Sandy: [shows SpongeBob a picture of her] Oh! Sandy, my dear, you're in the right place at the right time.
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. Well, let me just say, Sandy, I have just as much respect for your artistic genius as you do. [sadly]
Sandy: [off-screen]
SpongeBob: I like to paint. [scene cuts to SpongeBob painting the words "Krabby Patties" on a blanket.] And this morning, I was so inspired by your karavels, I drew a very special karavel for you to visit. [a purple sponge named Squidward comes out of the water.]
Squidward: [flies away] SpongeBob, I'm sorry! [SpongeBob paints a likeness of Squidward on the karavel.]
SpongeBob: Aw, this is great! I'll never forget the first time I rode my bike in the middle of the ocean.
Squidward: [goes on the bike path with the "Krabby Patties" painted on his back.] I never rode my bike in the middle of the ocean!
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, what are you doing here?
Squidward: [has a smiley face and talks in a low voice] I'm painting "Krabby Patties" on my back.
SpongeBob: Why would you paint "Krabby Patties" on your back? [SpongeBob draws "Krabby Patties" on his back and he stands on it. SpongeBob goes on the bike path and draws "Krabby Patties" on his back. Squidward's face pops out of his head.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you can't paint the "Krabby Patties" on my back. [SpongeBob draws Squidward on his back and he stands on it.] Squidward wants to paint "Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Oh, Squidward, I'm sorry. [SpongeBob paints his "Krabby Patties" on his back.]
Squidward: [off-screen] I'm gonna paint "Krabby Patties." [SpongeBob draws a crosswalk that goes up to SpongeBob's house.]
SpongeBob: That's not really 'Krabby Patties' at all, Squidward.
Squidward: But I never thought it was the most romantic story I ever told. [SpongeBob draws a bridge over a river that goes down to his house. He draws a huge sign that says "Krabby Patties." SpongeBob goes on the bridge and writes "Krabby Patties." Squidward's face pops out and switches from "I never thought it was the most romantic story I ever told" to "Krabby Patties."]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Hey, Squidward, I'm so sorry you had to paint that "Krabby Patties."
Squidward: [off-screen] I guess I was just saying I'm sorry you had to paint that sign.
SpongeBob: But, Squidward, that was my story. [Squidward paints his sign.]
Squidward: [off-screen] Well, now I'm gonna paint "Krabby Patties." [SpongeBob draws a wide circle around the sign that says "Krabby Patties." Squidward writes "Krabby Patties." SpongeBob goes on the bridge and it goes over to Squidward's house.]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Hey, Squidward, I'm sorry you had to paint that "Krabby Patties."
Squidward: [off-screen] What?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, your mother told me to paint "Krabby Patties." Well, she said, "Because you're too kind."
Squidward: [off-screen] Well, then, I'm gonna paint "Krabby Patties."
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Okay, that's it.
Squidward: [off-screen] All right. Well, stop messing around. [SpongeBob writes in the "Krabby Patties" sign.]
