<Start Ep> 
[The episode begins at SpongeBob's house. He is sleeping, and Gary is waking up.]
SpongeBob: [screaming as he hears Gary's alarm] Gary, I'm awake! [gets up from his bed, and sees Gary] How dare you disturb my sleepy Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [opens the door] Patrick! [leaves]
Patrick: [shocked] What's going on?
SpongeBob: [opens the door and sees Patrick's still sleeping] Oh, Patrick, what is that horrible music you're playing?
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob, it's the music of my bad dream.
SpongeBob: I know, Patrick. But I've never heard this kind of music before.
Patrick: What are you talking about?
SpongeBob: [screaming] Why are you all playing that scary music?
Patrick: It's because I've been hallucinating.
SpongeBob: [screaming] What's that music?
Patrick: It's my bad dream.
SpongeBob: Patrick, what is it?
Patrick: It's my bad dream. [screaming]
SpongeBob: Patrick, we don't know what it is.
Patrick: It's my bad dream.
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick!
Patrick: It's my bad dream.
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick!
Patrick: It's my bad dream.
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick!
Patrick: It's my bad dream.
SpongeBob: Patrick, Patrick!
Patrick: It's my bad dream.
[Camera cuts to a close-up of Patrick's head with his reflection in it. Patrick pulls out his clarinet and plays it loud and clear. The score changes to Patrick's clarinet playing the "bad dream" theme tune "La La La La" over SpongeBob's clarinet. It plays "La La La La," then cuts back to the "good dream" theme tune "La La La". Patrick plays the clarinet, then runs out of the house with the clarinet, screaming.]
Patrick: [screaming] Oh, what's going on?
SpongeBob: That's what happened to me.
Patrick: [screaming] What's going on?
SpongeBob: That's what happened to me. [Patrick runs off]
Patrick: Oh, good riddance, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [Stops Patrick and giggles] Patrick?
Patrick: Oh, hey, SpongeBob! Did you hear that?
SpongeBob: [on the phone] Hello? Hello?
Patrick: What's up?
SpongeBob: [On the phone] I'm having a conversation with a friend. I'd like to discuss the possibility of having my own personal bad dream.
Patrick: Oh, what are you saying?
SpongeBob: If I could, I'd say, "That's it, that's how it is."
Patrick: You said it?
SpongeBob: No, it was the opposite.
Patrick: What's wrong with you?
SpongeBob: I'm not good enough.
Patrick: Well, you two have to figure out a way to have your own bad dream.
SpongeBob: But I'm not good enough.

SpongeBob: But I'm not good enough.
Patrick: Well, then, you've got to figure out a way to have my own bad dream.
SpongeBob: But I'm not good enough.
Patrick: Well, then, you've got to...
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're right. We've got to figure out a way to have my own bad dream.
Patrick: [screaming] Not so fast, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [On the phone] I'm having a conversation with a friend. I'd like to discuss the possibility of having my own personal bad dream.
Patrick: Oh no.
