<Start Ep> 
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is eating all of Plankton's junk at the Chum Bucket.]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of the Chum Bucket] Hey, Plankton, what's going on here? [begins to sweat] What kind of job is that?
Plankton: Well, it's a sort of secret army operation. I'm the one who got him all this way, and I'm here to stop him from getting to the surface.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, all you stupid Krabys, you're just on your fifth commandment.
Plankton: [puts on his command necklace] I'll show you what I mean. [puts on his command necklace] I command you to stop making me laugh!
Mr. Krabs: [shows his command necklace] No, no, no, no, no, no! [Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton] Oh, Plankton, you're too stupid to command me.
Plankton: [sighs] I'm not dumb. I'm just a nice guy.
Mr. Krabs: Fine, my only job is to make Krabby Patties and your job is to make me laugh. But that's not what I'm about.
Plankton: What?
Mr. Krabs: Well, you know what?
Plankton: Don't you worry, Krabs. I don't want to hear about your... [puts on his command necklace]
Mr. Krabs: [holds up his command necklace] The necklace's on the naughty side.
Plankton: Did you get that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What?
Plankton: I demand you stop playing with my life. You're ruining my brand.
Mr. Krabs: [holds up his command necklace] The necklace's on the naughty side.
Plankton: Well, if you want me to stop, I don't want you to bother putting me down. [puts on his command necklace]
Mr. Krabs: [holds up his command necklace] We can't have this. [puts on his command necklace]
Plankton: I don't think I can stand it.
Mr. Krabs: [holds up his command necklace] We'll just have to take your necklace and... [puts on his command necklace]
Plankton: [closes his eyes] Hmmm... I've got it. [He holds out a guitar]
Mr. Krabs: [opens his door] Ah, I see you there. [He and Plankton head for the kitchen]
Plankton: [closes his eyes] Hi, Mr. Krabs. [He and Plankton leave the kitchen with the necklace]
Mr. Krabs: [closes his eyes] Oh, good night, Plankton.
Plankton: [closes his eyes] Do you want to take my necklace?
Mr. Krabs: [closes his eyes] Y-You can do that, babe.
Plankton: [closes his eyes]  You're too dangerous.
Mr. Krabs: [closes his eyes] Oh, no, I'm not. [He and Plankton leave the kitchen.]
Plankton: [closes his eyes] Hey, you're not going anywhere. [He and Plankton crash down on the front of the truck.]
Mr. Krabs: [closes his eyes] Oh, Plankton, you're just ruining my brand.
Plankton: [closes his eyes] Uh, I was just kidding, hmm?
Mr. Krabs: [closes his eyes] Oh, I think I understand.
Plankton: [closes his eyes] Uh, is that what you think?
Mr. Krabs: [closes his eyes] I'm sorry, [Closes his eyes] I'm not sure how you're gonna give me that, [Closes his eyes] and you've ruined my brand. [He walks off.]
Plankton: [closes his eyes] Oh, what a stupid fool you are. [Looks at the necklace on the ground. It's empty.] This isn't mine. [He walks up to the table of Plankton.]
Plankton: You're going to have to give me back what I gave you, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [closes his eyes] That's it, I'm going home. [He walks up to a table of Plankton. Plankton is sitting on the chair.]
Plankton: [closes his eyes] I'm not going home!
