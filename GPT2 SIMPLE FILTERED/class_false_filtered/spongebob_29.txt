[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick walking with a cart full of bubble wrap and their bags. SpongeBob is dragging the bubble wrap around Squidward's house, but Squidward refuses to let go of it.]
Squidward: Stop! You're ruining me! [pulls out a mallet]
[SpongeBob gives Patrick a real-life version of his house and SpongeBob puts it in his head to pretend to live there. SpongeBob then goes to the front door and walks to his clarinet playing.]
SpongeBob: [screams] Squidward, where's your clarinet playing?
Squidward: It's not playing! It's playing here!
[SpongeBob walks up to Squidward's house and pulls the clarinet out from under his rock. Squidward knocks on the door.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, check your clarinet playing.
Squidward: Oh, no. It's getting very dusty. [opens the door]
SpongeBob: [gulps] Squidward, what do you want?
Squidward: I don't know. I have a very long career here, I don't want to waste any more years of my life here.
SpongeBob: Okay. But you want to go home.
Squidward: I don't. [Opens door]
SpongeBob: Wait! You can't stay! I don't want to be here! [gulps] Where's your clarinet playing?
