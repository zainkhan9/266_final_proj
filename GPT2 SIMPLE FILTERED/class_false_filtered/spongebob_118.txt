<Start Ep> [Everyone's asleep at table. A creepy old dude appears out of the corner of their eye.]
Old man: Hey, something's not right with your pillow.
Squidward: Don't worry. I'll fix it. [SpongeBob starts playing. Squidward walks up to the couch and takes out a pillow.]
Squidward: [screaming] Get away! I don't want to wake you!
SpongeBob: [screams again] I don't want to wake you!
Squidward: Get away! Get away! [screams] Get away! Get away! [screams] Get away! [screams] Get away!
SpongeBob: Squidward, it's okay to be sad. But just because someone woke you up doesn't mean you have to be happy. You just have to learn to love those who wake you up. [closes door]
Squidward: I'll take it away, SpongeBob. Just do your thing.
SpongeBob: You know, Squidward, I think I know what it's like to be happy.
Squidward: Yeah. Isn't that what I like best?
SpongeBob: No. But it's what I like the most.
Squidward: Well, there's nothing like a happy birthday.
SpongeBob: What are you celebrating?
Squidward: I'm celebrating...
SpongeBob: [jumps on top of Squidward] Happy birthday, Squidward! Happy birthday, Squidward! Happy birthday, Squidward!
Squidward: [stops SpongeBob] What am I going to do? Do you really think I can't get on this roller coaster?
SpongeBob: I don't know. It's too dangerous.
Squidward: Well, it's not dangerous when you're scared. You're not going to be able to get out of here very long. [SpongeBob jumps off the roller coaster]
SpongeBob: [screams] My eyes are bloodshot!
Squidward: SpongeBob, don't! You're ruining my birthday.
SpongeBob: [gulps] It's not necessary.
Squidward: No, it's not. I've been on it for years and years.
SpongeBob: But, it's too dangerous!
Squidward: Wait! You mean you're not scared of it?
SpongeBob: I'm scared of it! [gulps] I'm scared of it! [gulps] I'm scared of it! [gulps] I'm scared of it! [gulps] It's too dangerous! [gulps]
Squidward: I'm not scared! [SpongeBob runs off]
SpongeBob: What happened?
Squidward: I'm scared of ice cream!
SpongeBob: You mean you don't know what that means?
Squidward: No. I've never heard of it. [screams]
SpongeBob: You wanna know what's dangerous about it?
