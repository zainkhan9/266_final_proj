Squidward: [SpongeBob comes out wearing a SpongeBob hat and holding a book, while holding a broom] My favorite book now? "The Sponge Who Could Fly?" [SpongeBob turns his hat on the lamp. SpongeBob grabs it, and Squidward walks over to him]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. [Squidward snatches the book and smashes it into the ground. SpongeBob quickly takes the book and goes to read it.] Oh, this is starting to kind of suck. [hugs Squidward] What's the matter?
Squidward: My books are all over the place. [Squidward starts to feel a little guilty, but Squidward stops him] Besides, I've been wasting my time on your books for years.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah?
Squidward: I've read 'em all. [Squidward starts to cry] And I've read 'em all about money. [Squidward starts crying]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, it's okay to be heartbroken. [Squidward starts to sob. SpongeBob takes the book and goes to read it] What do you think of this book? [hears a knock at the door] What the garbled heck?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I don't know. What happened to the book?
SpongeBob: Well, it's in your hands now.
Squidward: [sighs] Please help me get my books back. I don't have time to play cards with these old books. [Squidward holds up a set of playing cards] I'm tired of your useless books. What do you think I will do for you, Squidward?
SpongeBob: Well, this is the most important book in the whole house. I have it in my back pocket. I don't want to lose it.
Squidward: [stops SpongeBob] I don't want to lose my book!
SpongeBob: You're right. I'm tired of your worthless books. [Squidward notices SpongeBob's face]
Squidward: Oh, well, I'll have it back. [walks to the door]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, it's you.
Squidward: Well, I don't want to lose my book. It's in my back pocket.
SpongeBob: Oh, well, I'll have it back. [walks to the door]
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, I'm sorry if I'm late. I'm sorry I'm late. [SpongeBob walks away]
SpongeBob: Wait! I gotta go!
Squidward: Oh, well, we're all alone. [scene cuts to the Krusty Krab]
Nat: Hey, what are you doing in my restaurant?!
SpongeBob: Oh, I just got a tip. Just one ketchup packet with the tip of a single can of ketchup.
Nat: [sighs] Ahem.
SpongeBob: Thanks. [points to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is in the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Where's me money? [SpongeBob runs into Mr. Krabs] SpongeBob, you've got to help me find a new job.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into dollar bills]
Mr. Krabs: [to SpongeBob] What do you think I'm gonna do about this?
SpongeBob: I'm gonna call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm gonna quit!
Mr. Krabs: Really?
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs. I'm gonna have to find a new job. I have to learn to say thank you. [SpongeBob leaves. Mr. Krabs walks over to the door]
Mr. Krabs: [to SpongeBob] How are you gonna do that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Well, I have to say a big thank you to all the other employees.
Mr. Krabs: [to SpongeBob] You guys?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: And here's your new manager.
SpongeBob: Oh, hello, manager.
Mr. Krabs: What do you know about the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob: Well, I've... [Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into penny-sized dollar bills]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's a real nice little restaurant.
SpongeBob: Well, it's not really mine.
Mr. Krabs: Why don't you
