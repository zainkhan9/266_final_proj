Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Squidward: What's wrong, Patrick?
Patrick: Squidward, I think I just lost it.
Squidward: Yes, of course it's lost.
Patrick: Oh, sir.
Squidward: Oh, no.
SpongeBob: I am sorry. Squidward, sir, I do not want SpongeBob to lose it.
Squidward: Well, SpongeBob, I can't help but think it must be true. [SpongeBob frowns] It sure is, SpongeBob, but I don't feel like I've seen it [laughs] before in your mirror.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Well, what do you want me to see?
SpongeBob: You know, Squidward, you're the best person to work with.
Squidward: I know you're right, SpongeBob. I want to win.
SpongeBob: [bowing to Squidward] Oh, of course!
Squidward: You know, SpongeBob, I would never lose it.
SpongeBob: I know you're right. I want to win. [laughs]
Squidward: Oh, you mean like this?
SpongeBob: Yes, this. [shows a brick to Squidward]
Squidward: Look, SpongeBob, I'm here to see your grand piano.
SpongeBob: [sniffles, realizing what he's seeing] Oh, great Neptune. I'm gonna get one.
Squidward: Oh, I know, I have one too. [gets out of bed]
SpongeBob: [stops at a red light] Good morning, Squidward.
