SpongeBob: [on phone] Hello, Patrick.
Patrick: I'm trying to read a story, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry, Patrick. I've got a little break.
Patrick: Sorry.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's see here. You're not even here in two hours.

SpongeBob: [turns off the lights] Well, are you sure you're not gonna draw me a drawing of yourself a little later today?
Patrick: [turns off the lights] I'm not sure.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm a little nervous. I know you're a really great artist, but I just can't draw you that way. You're just gonna draw me a joke. [turns off the lights]
Patrick: [scratches his head] You're not really drawing me a joke.
SpongeBob: [turns on the light] Patrick, why is my hair so short?
Patrick: [scratches his head more] Oh, it's just so long you can't see my eyes.
SpongeBob: [scratches his head again] Patrick, you are so short that your brain is missing out.
Patrick: Okay, I think you're right. I'm missin' you.
SpongeBob: [scratches his head] My brain, my brain.
Patrick: Yeah, but your brain is just too small.
SpongeBob: [scratches his head again] I was just kidding.
Patrick: Get out!
SpongeBob: [scratches his head again] And if you draw me a drawing of you I'm gonna draw you a million times over!
Patrick: [sarcastically] No!
SpongeBob: [scratches his head] I don't need your help, SpongeBob, I've done it before. [turns on the light] I'm gonna draw you a drawing of yourself a million times over!
Patrick: I'll draw you a drawing of yourself a million times over!
SpongeBob: [scratches his head] I don't need your help, Patrick, I've done it before. [turns on the light] I'm gonna draw you a drawing of yourself a million times over!
Patrick: I'll draw you a drawing of yourself a million times over!
SpongeBob: [scratches his head] I don't need your help, Patrick, I've done it before. [turns on the light] I'm gonna draw you a drawing of yourself a million times over!
