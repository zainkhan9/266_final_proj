SpongeBob: [pops out of Patrick's house, laughing] I don't think Patrick's here.
Patrick: [sniffs] What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Oh, I thought you were in town.
Patrick: Where are you?
SpongeBob: [notices] I'm not in town.
Patrick: Don't look! I'm in Bikini Bottom. [closes door]
SpongeBob: [closes door] Where are you gonna hide?
Patrick: [notices] I'm not here.
SpongeBob: [notices] Come on, Patrick, we've got a long way to go before we've got any valuable information.
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: [gets in Patrick's canoe, and drives away] Patrick, your trail is on the way.
Patrick: I know! What are you going to do?
SpongeBob: [gets out of Patrick's canoe] I'm sorry, Patrick, but I'm not here to see any valuable information. I'm here to see someone who has the gift of knowing.
Patrick: Say, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Well, I thought you said that I was in town. Um, we should probably leave, because that's where we're going to hide.
Patrick: Well, that's okay. [shows Patrick the door]
SpongeBob: [pulls Patrick out] There's no place like home. I've been thinking lately about coming home.
Patrick: It's great to be back in Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob: [Holds up a mirror] I'll be in my room, reading to my family, and scrubbing the floor.
Patrick: [Shuts the mirror] I don't know what you're talking about.
SpongeBob: I'm not scrubbing the floor!
Patrick: Oh, I see you.
SpongeBob: [hugs Patrick] Hi, Patrick.
