[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs and Mr. Krabs' manager, Patrick, are working on a delivery.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'd like to place an order for two. It's lunch time. [whispers] And I have a delivery man come by and he wants to know how you're gonna get there.
[Mr. Krabs walks up to Patrick.]
Patrick: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What do you know about delivery?
Patrick: Delivery?
[Suddenly, the delivery man stops and grunts in frustration.]
Mr. Krabs: Delivery?
Patrick: Delivery?
[Mr. Krabs passes Patrick. Patrick gets up and goes to punch Mr. Krabs in the gut.]
Patrick: I can't believe they paid me for delivery.
Mr. Krabs: Are you kidding? I hate delivery.
Patrick: Uh, yeah, I really don't mind.
[Patrick knocks the delivery man's delivery box and the box opens. Patrick knocks on it and it opens and Patrick knocks on it.]
Patrick: [announcing the delivery] I'm Mr. Krabs. [Patrick knocks on the box and its lid.] I'm the delivery man and I just got delivery.
Mr. Krabs: Delivery?
Patrick: Delivery!
[Patrick leaves and gets into a taxi. He takes the box and walks to the Chum Bucket, where he enters his office and picks up Patrick. He checks out the box and gets in.]
Patrick: Uh, hello.
[Patrick sees the box and the delivery man.]
Patrick: Hello?
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's exactly what I was looking for.
Patrick: But you said you were here for delivery.
Mr. Krabs: [pushes Patrick away] You said you were here for delivery.
Patrick: [angry] Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I can't take it anymore.
[Patrick grumbles angrily and hops into his taxi. Patrick drives off.]
Patrick: I still have delivery bags and I'm gonna need them to get to the Chum Bucket.
[Patrick drives off.]
