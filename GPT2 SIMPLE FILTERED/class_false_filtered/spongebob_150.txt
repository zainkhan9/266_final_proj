[The scene above shows Squidward in a costume as a cowboy riding a horse. He is shown sitting in a seat near a table, wearing a helmet, and with a hat on.]
Squidward: [Whispers] I don't see anything wrong with that. What do you think?
SpongeBob: [Gives Squidward a cowboy hat]
Squidward: [Gives him a cowboy hat]
SpongeBob: [Whispers] Heh. [Grabs a handful of teeth from behind his back] I guess I'll have to give him a ride.
Squidward: [Gives him a ride on a horse]
SpongeBob: [Whispers] Uh, Squidward, my horse is so cute. How do you think I can get him to stop and get a ride on him?
Squidward: [Crying] This isn't the most exciting day of my life. You are way too sweet. Get out of my life.
SpongeBob: [Crying] I hate you! You are the most beautiful thing I ever met!
Squidward: [Crying] I will never get my horse back!
SpongeBob: [Crying] I never will!
Squidward: [Crying] I'm sorry. I'll never have a ride with you.
SpongeBob: [Crying] I was wrong! You are too sweet! Get out of my life!
