<Start Ep> 
[The episode begins at a frozen lake. SpongeBob and Patrick are standing outside of the Krusty Krab.]
Patrick: [gulps] Phew! I got ya! [pokes SpongeBob in the face with his elbow]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick! What happened to you?
Patrick: I guess I just needed a little privacy.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, you sure did come back from your nap.
Patrick: [gulps] Oh, you sure did. I'm a bit nervous about going outside again.
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary.
Patrick: [gulps] I just need a place to sleep.
SpongeBob: Gary?
Patrick: [gulps] Yeah, okay, SpongeBob. [grows up into Patrick's chest]
SpongeBob: [gulps] Patrick, look out. A bed of bugs is exactly what I need! [dresses himself as a creep as SpongeBob walks towards him] I am a creep.
[SpongeBob looks at Patrick's reflection.]
Patrick: [sits on his rock] Good night, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob opens the door and sees a huge, white, flesh-colored bed.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick, it's me!
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: You're right. A bed of bugs is exactly what I need! [waves his hands] I am a creep. [tries to rub the bugs on Patrick's legs]
SpongeBob: All right, Patrick.
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: No!
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: No!
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: No!
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: No!
Patrick: No!
SpongeBob: No!
Patrick: No! [SpongeBob and Patrick come out of the door] Okay, Gary. [giggles]
SpongeBob: Gary?
Patrick: [giggles] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SpongeBob: [opens the doors] Where's Patrick?
Patrick: [giggles] Oh, he's in the living room.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick?
Patrick: [giggles] In the living room?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Oh, you sure do. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Patrick: Okay.
SpongeBob: [tries to rub the bugs off] [laughs] Let's see where this bed is. [walks off]
[The scene changes to SpongeBob's pineapple. Patrick is sleeping on Patrick's rock.]
Patrick: [reaches down and pulls himself and SpongeBob together] Oh, my gosh! [tries to rub the bugs off] I can't do this! I'm a creep! [pokes his head up and down] Oh, my gosh! What am I going to do now? [puts on his boots, but the bug bites off his leg.] [screams] SpongeBob! [goes up to SpongeBob] Patrick, tell him I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
SpongeBob: Hmm... You know, Patrick, I'm not a creep. [looks through the telescope where a creepy robo-like creature is watching him] But I am a creep, right?
Patrick: Yeah, yeah.
SpongeBob: Well, let's get out of here. [door slams]
Patrick: [sits on his rock] Hey, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick, what happened?
Patrick: SpongeBob! [sniffs] What's going on?
SpongeBob: I'm a creep!
Patrick: Ack! [the creature runs away]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick!
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're not a creep at all! You're a monster!
SpongeBob: Uh, I'm a monster!
Patrick: Well, I don't know. Aren't you a little bit creepier?
SpongeBob: Hm... [Patrick wipes the dirt off his rock]
Patrick: Can you believe it? I'm a creep!
SpongeBob: Hhmm, I see. Well, take your time. I know you've all been waiting for this for days.
Patrick: [gasps] I'm a creep!
SpongeBob: Hm.
Patrick: Are you?
SpongeBob: I'm a creep. [a monster appears from behind the rock]
Patrick: Monster! [monster screams] Monster!
SpongeBob: [monster grips Patrick] Monster! Monster!
Patrick: Monster! Monster! [monster pulls
