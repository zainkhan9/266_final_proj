SpongeBob: [notices a sign that says "Free Lunch" and has to jump into Squidward's boat] Huh?
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Squidward, I'm gonna help you get free lunch.
Squidward: No, thank you, thank you. [SpongeBob stops laughing and Squidward goes back to SpongeBob]

Squidward: SpongeBob, free lunch! [SpongeBob stops laughing and Squidward walks back]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, I got free lunch! [Squidward runs away]

Squidward: [sarcastically] No, thank you. [SpongeBob stops laughing]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Squidward, you ruined my day.
Squidward: [scared] My lunch? [SpongeBob is surprised]
SpongeBob: [gives him a turkey sandwich] Grilling? [SpongeBob's eyes widen and he gets angry]
Squidward: What? Free lunch?
SpongeBob: You're not going to get me free lunch if you really hate science!
Squidward: What?!
SpongeBob: I wouldn't stand for it! [Squidward jumps at Squidward's face, but Squidward stays on his hands and knees and does his own free-wheeling]
Squidward: Oh, that's it.
SpongeBob: All I wanted was to be able to get some of your lunches.
Squidward: [sadly] Sorry. [takes out a tray with some food on it]
SpongeBob: Okay, bye. [walks to the kitchen] Today, I am going to take this tray of food, and, me first free lunch, and I am going to count it. [jumps on a metal table] More like, [holds up a stick of dynamite] "See ya tomorrow!"
Squidward: [stops SpongeBob's hand from reaching his food] I didn't have to count it.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, I'm gonna be late for my free lunch!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [gasps as Squidward gets up] I am late for my free lunch! [SpongeBob fills in his form, but Squidward's eyes are closed and he is confused] Squidward, you said "See ya tomorrow!"
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Squidward, I'm late for your free lunch!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Squidward, I'm late for my free lunch! [SpongeBob's eyes get bigger and bigger and Squidward gets scared]
Squidward: SpongeBob, [gasps] You did the same thing I did!
SpongeBob: Why?
Squidward: Because...
SpongeBob: Because you were late for my free lunch!
Squidward: Oh... I don't get it!
