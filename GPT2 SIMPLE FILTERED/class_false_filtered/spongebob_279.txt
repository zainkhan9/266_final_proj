Squidward: [Breathing heavily] Ah, the sound of a synthesizer.
SpongeBob: [walks up to the stage] Squidward, I'm sorry we had to postpone your concert. But I'm here to present you with your very own live concert.
Squidward: Will you join me?
SpongeBob: Squidward, I am honored to be your friend.
Squidward: I can't believe you let me play in your house anymore. How do you get around here without any entertainment?
SpongeBob: I like to call this gig "The Krusty Krab Live Feed." [laughs]
Squidward: So, what's your secret?
SpongeBob: Well, my secret is that I'm a lousy dancer, and I shouldn't be allowed here.
Squidward: Well, I can't believe this is all true! [laughs]
SpongeBob: That's right. My secret is that I'm terrible at the dance.
Squidward: My secret?
SpongeBob: My secret.
Squidward: My secret?
SpongeBob: My secret.
Squidward: My secret.
SpongeBob: My secret.
Squidward: My secret. [laughs]
SpongeBob: Great! Here you go, Squidward. [Squidward jumps back onto stage]
Squidward: This is great. I'm so honored.
SpongeBob: And now, your guest, Squidward, is...
Squidward: Squidward... [Squidward jumps in front of SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: You're welcome.
Squidward: What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Uh, I'm going to eat some popcorn.
Squidward: What? What?
SpongeBob: Just a cup of popcorn. [peeks into his kitchen window to see Squidward]
Squidward: And then I'll be at the Krusty Krab to meet the man who's been my idol for so long. [Squidward moves the popcorn box closer to Squidward]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, that's it! You're here. [Squidward moves the popcorn closer to SpongeBob]
Squidward: What do you want from me?
SpongeBob: Well, I'm going to have to bring back a friend.
Squidward: And you're not coming in the front row, are you?
SpongeBob: Uh, I'm coming in the back.
Squidward: And you're going to be performing live?
SpongeBob: Yeah, sure. [Squidward moves the popcorn closer to SpongeBob]
Squidward: Okay. You're always welcome.
SpongeBob: Well, I'd just like to introduce you to Jim.
Jim: [puts popcorn in his mouth] Hi!
SpongeBob: Hi, Jim.
Jim: So, what is your secret?
SpongeBob: My secret is that I'm terrible at the dance.
Jim: Oh, hello.
SpongeBob: Oh, hello.
Jim: Um, uh, do you have a secret number?
SpongeBob: Well, I don't have a secret number.
Jim: What about the number 52?
SpongeBob: Well, I haven't had a second chance with this.
Jim: Alright.
SpongeBob: Uh, it's the answer to my question.
Jim: Uh, what's your secret number?
SpongeBob: Uh, it's the answer to your question.
Jim: Uh, you're...
