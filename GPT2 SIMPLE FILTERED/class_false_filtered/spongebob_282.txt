SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward's got all the dang ideas.
Squidward: [SpongeBob's eyes get bloodshot] SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to me, huh? [SpongeBob starts to panic] SpongeBob, can I give you a hand on that [SpongeBob starts to panic] Now?
SpongeBob: Squidward's not listening to me. He's just waiting for me to come up with something to blow out the candles. [laughs]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you're such a nutcase.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Squidward, what's wrong with you?
Squidward: Well, SpongeBob, I have a confession to make.
SpongeBob: Oh, there's one more thing I can't seem to get out of my system. [SpongeBob notices something in the water] What the...? Squidward, are you okay?
Squidward: Well, SpongeBob... SpongeBob, uhh, I just heard that the wind is blowing in here.
SpongeBob: [pokes his nose out from under Squidward] Squidward, are you okay?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'm fine.
SpongeBob: Well, what do you mean?
Squidward: [stops breathing] I've gotta get back to the Krusty Krab. Wait, that's not what I said.
SpongeBob: Well, I admit it. I've been waiting for this whole thing to end.
Squidward: SpongeBob, you're right. The Krusty Krab is the most dangerous place to be a pirate.
SpongeBob: But I guess I could of course take advantage of all the free rides this place has to offer. [SpongeBob and Squidward walk to the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, wait! I'm not gonna blow your candles!
Squidward: Pirates, we're not pirates! We're mindless cannonballs! We're lunatics!
SpongeBob: But I guess I got a point. [SpongeBob and Squidward walk to the Krusty Krab]
[SpongeBob and Squidward continue to walk until they meet at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: I know, Squidward. I'll bet you and I know who you are. [Squidward stops walking]
Squidward: [looking at the two] You're not pirates because you're a pirate. You're pirates because you're a mindless cannonball.
SpongeBob and Squidward: [both look at each other]
SpongeBob: You know, Squidward, I've known a guy who looks like you. And he's a pirate. And I love him.
Squidward: Well, let's go play in the woods.
SpongeBob: Yes! [Squidward leaves]
Squidward: [looking at the two] You're pirates because you're a mindless cannonball.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward! Why, I love you! You're my best friend.
Squidward: Oh, why?
SpongeBob: Because you were born into a long line of mindless cannonballs. I love you so much!
Squidward: [snickers] I wish I were a doctor.
SpongeBob: But I'm not. Why?
Squidward: Because I'm too lazy to go out in the wild. [pulls out a flashlight]
SpongeBob: ...Or that stupid, undersea world. [tries to listen to a pirate story] Or that pirate ship that you're about to visit.
Squidward: The pirates came to visit and I'm here to see you.
SpongeBob: I've been waiting in the woods for you all day. [snickers, getting a better idea]
Squidward: [screams] Are you gonna tell me all these things?! I'm sick of listening to you! [SpongeBob walks up to Squidward]
SpongeBob: What are you doing here, Squidward?
Squidward: You were born into a bunch of mindless cannonballs.
SpongeBob: Why, yes, I am.
Squidward: You are the ultimate mindless cannonball.
SpongeBob: Well, then, why don't you get rid of your stupid, undersea life and come out here and say my name?
Squidward: Uh, uh, I'm afraid you're too slow. [laughs] I'm afraid I'll be impatient.
SpongeBob: Why, it's what it is. This is my natural habitat. [Squidward walks up to a rock and giggles. Some
