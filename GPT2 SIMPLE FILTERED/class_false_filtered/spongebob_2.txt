SpongeBob: [singing, in SpongeBob's pineapple] SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
Patrick: [in SpongeBob's pineapple] SpongeBob, I don't have time for this. [in SpongeBob's pineapple] I'm sorry, SpongeBob. [in SpongeBob's pineapple] SpongeBob, you're ruining my perfect day.
[SpongeBob's pineapple starts to turn into a picture frame. The scene changes to SpongeBob looking through a telescope at the moon.]
SpongeBob: Wow, moon is pretty dim. We should probably start looking.
Patrick: [through telescope] You better start looking.
[As SpongeBob begins to see moonlight, the moon turns into a glow around him, making him see through a telescope.]
Patrick: [through telescope] Moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon.
[SpongeBob begins to see moonlight from behind his back.]
SpongeBob: [through telescope] Look, moon, moon, moon, moon. [softer tone]
[SpongeBob's moonlight shines on Patrick's. SpongeBob's moonlight moves up and down in front of Patrick's eyes. SpongeBob's moonlight floats in and out of his eyes, moving underneath the eyestalk as he moves through the scene.]
Patrick: [through telescope] Oh, SpongeBob, you're bright at night.
[SpongeBob's moonlight goes invisible to Patrick. SpongeBob's moonlight floats up in the sky and becomes a spotlight.]
Patrick: [through telescope] You know, SpongeBob, tonight is the night of the thieves. I think they'll all be caught.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh.]
Patrick: [through telescope] Well, if the moon's really shining on the thief's head, then we might be able to catch them.
[SpongeBob and Patrick laugh. SpongeBob's moonlight floats around them. SpongeBob imagines a pirate making a reef out of a sponge's leftover napkin. SpongeBob's moonlight floats around him and floats down to his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats down to his udder and floats into SpongeBob's udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats into SpongeBob's udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats into his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats into his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats into his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats into his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats into his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats into his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats into his udder.]
Patrick: I see you've got me all figured out.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, come on, you've got to come on.
[SpongeBob and Patrick jump into each other and we see SpongeBob's moonlight. SpongeBob's moonlight continues to float down to his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats down to his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats down to his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats down to his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats down to his udder. SpongeBob's moonlight floats down to his udder.
