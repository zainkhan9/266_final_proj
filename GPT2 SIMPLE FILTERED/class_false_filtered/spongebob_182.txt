<Start Ep> 
[The episode starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is wearing a wig and talking in a wimp voice. Mr. Krabs is playing the clarinet in SpongeBob's wig.]
Mr. Krabs: [scared] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [imitating Mr. Krabs] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boy, this is gonna be so exciting!
[He runs out of the Krusty Krab and into the crowd.]
Mr. Krabs: [screams] What have you done with all the money in the Krusty Krab?!
[Mr. Krabs runs into the crowd and SpongeBob's wig blows into the air.]
SpongeBob: Ahh!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are scared and they all run out of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: [angry] Whoa! Whoa!
SpongeBob: No!
[The crowd cheers for Mr. Krabs as SpongeBob runs into the kitchen.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, I'm gonna keep this one secret, over and over. You've got to come and stay and listen. Until then, I won't tell you how to make a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm gonna tell you how to make a Patty.
Mr. Krabs: What?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm gonna tell you how to make a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: What?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm gonna tell you how to make a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: What? [gasps] What in tarnation?!
[SpongeBob's hat shines in the light and Mr. Krabs laughs.]
SpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs. I've got to talk about my chances of succeeding in life.
Mr. Krabs: What, what's a chance of succeeding?
SpongeBob: Well, I don't have a chance. I'm lucky. I have my parents. My older brother-in-law. My best friend. My best friend.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, boy! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[Mr. Krabs is about to walk out of the Krusty Krab when a doorbell rings. SpongeBob pops out of the pocket and takes a paper bag with him.]
SpongeBob: Ee-hh! [falls through the door]
Mr. Krabs: I got you, SpongeBob. [snaps fingers and leaves]
SpongeBob: Wow, Mr. Krabs. I may not be good at business, but I'm good at talking to people.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Hey, I don't know how you're gonna make me take a job at the Krusty Krab if you don't work there.
SpongeBob: [opens the door] Mr. Krabs, what do you think of my new job?
Mr. Krabs: I'm just gonna be your manager.
SpongeBob: Well, I guess you could say that.
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] One day, I'm gonna do it for the high desert.
[SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab with a tray of Krabby Patties.]
SpongeBob: [holding a tray of patties] Here you go, sir.
[Mr. Krabs gives SpongeBob a tray of burgers.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, this is the finest burger ever created.
SpongeBob: Does this mean I'm your manager?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Yes.
[SpongeBob walks over to Mr. Krabs' office, where Mr. Krabs' head is covered in a paper bag and a pencil. He starts to leave.]
SpongeBob: What is this stuff?
Mr. Krabs: What's this stuff?
SpongeBob: It's a little ledger you put together.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'd like to give you this.
SpongeBob: Thanks. [sobbing]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Are you sure you don't want to work here?
[SpongeBob walks into the Krusty Krab with his tray of patties.]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy, this looks good.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you're in!
SpongeBob: [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [barks up] This.
Mr. Krabs: [barks down] Ugh.
SpongeBob: [laughs]
Mr.
