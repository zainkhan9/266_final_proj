[scene cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street with his pants on fire, which sparks a loud explosion and sends two buildings crashing. One skyscraper falls on Squidward, who is flying in the sky]
Squidward: Ow!
[scene cuts to SpongeBob, who is being held against the window of his house by the power of a giant vacuum cleaner, who screams in pain as the vacuum causes his body and his clothes to fly off and land on the floor. SpongeBob, in pain, grabs the vacuum cleaner and hops onto the bed. He then goes to blow some air into his body.]
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward.
Squidward: [screams] SpongeBob! I'm not doing that. I'm getting a massage now!
[SpongeBob pushes the button on the door and the vacuum cleaner flies away from Squidward. The vacuum cleaner spins around and crashes into the wall of his house, destroying it.]
SpongeBob: I can't believe it! [sniffs] I'm ruined! [starts to sob]
[SpongeBob runs into the Krusty Krab and his house collapses in front of him. SpongeBob, still sobbing, runs to the bathroom. He looks at his reflection and sees that his body has a lot of dust from the vacuum. He looks in the mirror and sees that it's just dust. He pushes the mirror back to normal, but all of a sudden, it starts to smell like stale ketchup and he smells like stale ketchup everywhere. He narrows his eyes and gets a whiff of the stale ketchup. He pulls himself out of the bathroom and starts to sweat profusely. He takes his towel, puts it on, and goes to wipe the stale ketchup off.]
SpongeBob: Hey, that smells stale. [jumps into the kitchen and smells the stale ketchup]
[The cork board on the side of the Krusty Krab is filled with stale ketchup. SpongeBob looks in the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: What's the holdup with that ketchup? [tries to pull out the bottle of stale ketchup, but can't]
[SpongeBob pulls out a rubber band and pulls out stale ketchup.]
SpongeBob: I'm not smelling stale!
[SpongeBob removes stale ketchup from his mouth and goes to wipe the stale ketchup off.]
SpongeBob: Hey, those stale kipperspiel are calling my life a nightmare!
[SpongeBob picks up a trashcan and puts it in the trashcan. He tries to open the window, but the window's lock is too high, so he opens it and pulls the window down instead. The stale ketchup goes into the trashcan and SpongeBob is about to pull the bottle of ketchup to open it. However, the bottle of ketchup popped and ends up on the table. He pulls the bottle down and pulls the table's hooks, but the table's hooks are no where near enough to close the bottle, and the stale ketchup comes out of the kitchen.]
SpongeBob: Ah! I'm ruined! [jumps out the kitchen, but the stale ketchup comes back]
[SpongeBob pulls the bottle of ketchup out and holds it in front of the washing machine. The stale ketchup goes to the washing machine, but the washing machine's hooks break and the bottle ends up on the washing machine's hooks. SpongeBob pulls the bottle back and pulls away from the hook, but the bottle ends up in the sewage treatment plant.]
SpongeBob: [gets up] Oh, no, no, no!
[SpongeBob pulls the bottle back and pulls away from the hook, but the bottle ends up in the sewer system. SpongeBob pulls away from the hook, but ends up in the sewer pipe. SpongeBob pulls away from the hook, but ends up in the sewer pipe. SpongeBob pulls away from the hook, but ends up in the sewer pipe. SpongeBob pulls away from the hook, but ends up in the sewer pipe. SpongeBob pulls away from the hook, but ends up in the sewer pipe. SpongeBob pulls away, but stops]
[SpongeBob pulls the bottle away and pulls it back. He pulls it away, but stops when the bottle goes back on the washing machine's hook.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, I'm ruined!
Squidward: Where are you?
[Squidward picks up the bottle and starts to put it on the washing machine's hook. Squidward pulls the bottle away, but stops when the bottle goes on the washing machine's hook.]
SpongeBob: I'm ruined!
Squidward: You ruined my life!
SpongeBob: [sits on the washing machine's hook] I'm ruined!
