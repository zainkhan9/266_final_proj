[SpongeBob is sitting on the couch watching a movie, and Mr. Krabs pops out of the living room.]
Mr. Krabs: [eats a Krabby Patty] You're not gonna like it, Squidward. It's a deliciously fried, underdone Patty. [follows SpongeBob and gets out a can of tuna] Here we go. [gives SpongeBob the can of tuna] I'll get more out of this. [takes the can of tuna] Look, SpongeBob, you're already over-fried.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy!
Mr. Krabs: [hangs up the can] You can't give that to me. [sticks the can of tuna in SpongeBob's mouth, and eats it. SpongeBob is so tired that he falls over in pain]
SpongeBob: Oh, no!
Mr. Krabs: [hangs up the can of tuna and continues to eat the can of tuna, grunting] Fine! I'll get you more out of this one, you two! [gets out a can of tuna] Here we go. [gets the can of tuna and bites into it. He eats it, and then he eats it back into his mouth, and then he ate it into his pants] Here we go. Get a load of these, boys!
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs watch the movie, and then Mr. Krabs grabs SpongeBob and leads him inside.]
Mr. Krabs: [pulls SpongeBob out of the kitchen] SpongeBob, you are gonna love this!
[SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen, and Mr. Krabs throws him on the floor.]
SpongeBob: I'm a genius!
Mr. Krabs: I don't know how you'd pull it off, but you're a genius! [runs to the bathroom]
SpongeBob: [gets picked up by Mr. Krabs] Hey, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're gonna love this!
SpongeBob: I'm a genius!
Mr. Krabs: [knocks SpongeBob out of the bathroom] SpongeBob, you're gonna love this!
SpongeBob: I'm a genius!
Mr. Krabs: [tries to pick up SpongeBob, but can't] SpongeBob, you're a genius!
SpongeBob: I'm a genius!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm a genius!
SpongeBob: [yells in Mr. Krabs' ear] SpongeBob! I'm a genius!
