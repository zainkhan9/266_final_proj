Squidward: Hey, Squidward, what's going on out there?
SpongeBob: I'm back.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob, what's wrong with him?
SpongeBob: I have a question.
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you sure you're okay?
SpongeBob: Oh, sure.
Squidward: What's wrong with him?
SpongeBob: There's something wrong with him.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, he's right. [notices something] I feel fine.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, look. He's right. He needs to get some rest.
Squidward: SpongeBob? I think he's suffering from something.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry. I just had to ask.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I just have to let him go.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I know. I just need him to calm down.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. I feel fine.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry. I just need him to rest.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, he's right. He needs to get some rest. [SpongeBob hands Squidward a blanket. Squidward gets scared. Then he takes a sand rug. Then he plays with a drum. Then he hugs a baby doll. Then he plays with a flower. Then he hugs a cat. Then he plays with a snake. Then he hugs a fish. Then he plays with a whale. Then he hugs a seahorse.]
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you so much, Squidward. We're just gonna have to go back to our old... [Squidward gasps. Then he pulls his pants down and his blanket falls on top of him. Squidward screams]
Squidward: SpongeBob, it's okay. We're just gonna have to go back to our old...
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward!
Squidward: What are you going to do?
SpongeBob: I'm going to have to put you in a hospital.
Squidward: Well, I can't take it anymore. It's too dangerous.
SpongeBob: That's okay, Squidward. We should get rid of the monster before it gets too far.
Squidward: What? You're not into that?
SpongeBob: I'm into that.
Squidward: Well, you can't throw me in the garbage can right now.
SpongeBob: Oh, no. I'm into the scary parts.
Squidward: [gets out a rock] Okay. [puts it in the garbage can and the garbage truck stops] Here you go, SpongeBob. Just stay here for a minute. I'll be your friend.
SpongeBob: You know, Squidward, I think I'm gonna go jump onto your limbo machine and break it in half.
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Okay. [grabs his limbo machine and starts to glue it]
Squidward: SpongeBob, you're gonna break it in half!
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward, that's the plan.
Squidward: Okay.
SpongeBob: Okay, I got it.
Squidward: All right, now get back to work! [runs out of the room]
[SpongeBob runs out of the room. But Squidward grabs his limbo machine and knocks him back into the garbage truck. Squidward starts to tear up the limbo machine. It crashes into a pole and SpongeBob and Squidward crash into it.]
SpongeBob: [stops running] Squidward, wait! I got it!
Squidward: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
SpongeBob: [runs backwards into the garbage truck] Squidward! Squidward, I got it! I got it, Squidward!
Squidward: [screams]
SpongeBob: [runs to the Krusty Krab] Squidward, you're ruining my restaurant business!
Squidward: [starts to tear up the Krusty Krab] It's terrible! It's terrible! It's horrible!
SpongeBob: And it
