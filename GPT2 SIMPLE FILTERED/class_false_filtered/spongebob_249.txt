<Start Ep> [The monitor appears at Squidward's house, who then opens the door and SpongeBob walks in. Squidward is sleeping, so SpongeBob opens the door and Squidward opens it back up]
Squidward: [Squidward goes into his room, but the door is locked behind him] Squidward! [Squidward wakes up and sees SpongeBob and Patrick in a room. He opens the door and Squidward opens it back up] Squidward! You! You two idiots! I got to get to the bottom of this!
[Squidward pulls the lever down and the lights turn off. A heart appears in front of Squidward and Patrick]
Patrick: [in the background] I'm Patrick! [Squidward screams and runs away, but the lights turn off]
Squidward: [in the background] I'm Squidward! [Squidward runs away and starts to spin around in circles]
SpongeBob: Squidward! You two idiots don't have to go to the hospital! You can go to the doctor right away!
Patrick: What are you going to do?
Squidward: I'm gonna get a brain scan right away. [sighs]
SpongeBob: Patrick, Squidward, I know you're very depressed, but you should treat this as normal as far as you're concerned.
Patrick: I'm not depressed.
SpongeBob: No, no, no, Squidward! It's the opposite! It's the opposite of the normal state! [SpongeBob's eyes start turning into hearts]
Patrick: I'm all out of looking.
SpongeBob: Patrick, Squidward, what are you gonna do?
Patrick: I'm going to go to the hospital right away.
SpongeBob: Okay, great, Patrick. [walks out of the hospital] Patrick, I can't see you.
Patrick: I'm going to the doctor right away.
SpongeBob: [confused] Patrick, you're right.
[Patrick sees the heart and screams like crazy. The scene cuts to the hospital where SpongeBob walks in. Patrick is swabbing the body of SpongeBob]
Patrick: Look out! That guy's a brain stem! [SpongeBob is tied to the wall with a net]
SpongeBob: Patrick, where are you?
Patrick: I'm in here, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're supposed to be in there.
Patrick: Well, I was just going to get you a brain scan.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're taking a break.
Patrick: Oh, you're taking a break?
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. I'm taking a break.
Patrick: Well, what about the rest of the day?
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. I'm take a break.
Patrick: No, SpongeBob, I'm taking a break.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, you're taking a break.
Patrick: Oh, it's-it's okay, SpongeBob. I'm taking a break. [SpongeBob is in a trance]
SpongeBob: What's happening, Patrick?
Patrick: It's happening.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're taking a break.
Patrick: Oh, I'm taking a break.
SpongeBob: Oh, it's happening.
Patrick: Oh, it's happening.
SpongeBob: Patrick, look. We're having a brain scan right now.

SpongeBob: Two seconds.
Patrick: Two seconds.
SpongeBob: Two seconds.
Patrick: Two seconds.
SpongeBob: Two seconds.
Patrick: Two seconds.
[The scene cuts to the hospital where Patrick is snoring]
SpongeBob: [opens the door] Patrick, I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well. [Patrick wakes up]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what?
SpongeBob: I've had a brain scan. It's like a brain scan. [Patrick looks at the screen]
Patrick: What happened?
SpongeBob: It was a brain scan.
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: It was...
Patrick: Brain scan.
SpongeBob: Brain scan.
Patrick: Oh, yeah?
SpongeBob: [gasp!]
Patrick: Oh, no! [SpongeBob sees a large brain and screams]
