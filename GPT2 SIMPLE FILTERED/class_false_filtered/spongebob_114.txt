SpongeBob: [at the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, what's up?
Mr. Krabs: I'm here to make sure everyone in town gets their fair shake.
SpongeBob: [along with Patrick] Just a little something to make you feel more welcome.
Mr. Krabs: Like this?
SpongeBob: [as Mr. Krabs pushes SpongeBob off] Okay, okay! [takes him behind the register]
Mr. Krabs: Here, let me see. [snaps his fingers and a sign that says "Open" forms in his face]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I just wanted to say that I'm delighted to have you as my new manager, and look forward to working with you soon. [puts on a square hat with a Krusty Krab "Krabby Patties" sign on it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [pulls Patrick away] Patrick, what happened?
Patrick: He was working at the register.
SpongeBob: Patrick, I just wanted you to know that I'm eager to work with you.
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: Well, I'm starting to think that the Krusty Krab isn't for everybody.
Patrick: Oh, I don't think so. Look what happened to the Krusty Krab. [SpongeBob starts to shake and growling and Patrick is starting to fade]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! [chuckles] You don't seem so happy.
Patrick: Oh, I guess I am.
SpongeBob: Oh, at least I didn't have to work there. [Patrick looks at his watch] See? I don't seem so happy.
Patrick: Oh, will you get over here? [takes SpongeBob's hat off]
SpongeBob: Patrick, how come you stay here all night?
Patrick: You can't stay up all night all night. [gets up and walks out of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I've been working here all night.
Mr. Krabs: I'm sure if you stay up all night, you'll get a job.
SpongeBob: But I'm not a manager.
Mr. Krabs: You'll have to work here. You'll have to stay here all night.
SpongeBob: But it's not working out.
Mr. Krabs: [goes on the offensive] You're right. [laughs] You're not supposed to stay up all night.
SpongeBob: [takes off his hat] You are right, Mr. Krabs. [SpongeBob and Patrick are giggling] You gotta stay up all night.
Mr. Krabs: [taps his shoulder] What are you blabbermouths doing?
SpongeBob: I'm not blabbermouthing, Mr. Krabs. I'm working in the kitchen.
Mr. Krabs: What's that?
SpongeBob: I'm gonna start an ad buy, and you better get a job.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, boy, do you think you can handle this?
SpongeBob: Get a job?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SpongeBob: Do you wanna be a stand-up guy?
Mr. Krabs: I'd better get something else.
SpongeBob: Anything else?
Mr. Krabs: You wanna go on a date?
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: Just go on a date.
SpongeBob: Okay.
Mr. Krabs: Okay.
SpongeBob: Oh, okay.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, okay!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, now hold on, SpongeBob. I don't think I can handle this.
SpongeBob: I'm not ready.
Mr. Krabs: You better get a job.
SpongeBob: Okay, yeah, okay.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, okay.
SpongeBob: Okay, okay!
Mr. Krabs: Okay, okay.
SpongeBob: Right away, Mr. Krabs. [walks to the register]
Patrick: [at the register] Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [sets his hat on the counter] Patrick, are you still here?
Patrick: [sets his hat on the counter] SpongeBob, am I in here?
SpongeBob: [sets his hat on the counter] Patrick, I
