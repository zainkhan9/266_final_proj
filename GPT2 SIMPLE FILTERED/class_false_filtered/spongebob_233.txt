[The episode opens up with SpongeBob and Patrick at the Chum Bucket]
Patrick: You should be able to get away with just talking to yourself. What better place to let a little weirdo down with me than with Squidward? [SpongeBob and Patrick start walking away]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. I'm trying to catch up with my old friend, Squidward.
Patrick: You're saying the same thing that I said you were saying, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, Patrick. Just the other day, I was talking to myself about myself. That's not what I said.
Patrick: Okay, sure, let's get a closer look. [walks away, hushing SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick! You need to talk to yourself.
Patrick: Well, as you know, I've become a bit of a recluse.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, that's what you said.
Patrick: So, could you talk about why you're now your own best friend?
SpongeBob: Well, uh, uh... [Patrick is back to talking] I like Squidward. I like him a lot.
Patrick: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's my best friend. [Patrick is still talking]
SpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's my best friend. [Patrick is still talking]
Patrick: Yeah. He's my best friend. [SpongeBob and Patrick are still talking]
SpongeBob: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Squidward walks up to them]
Squidward: Hey, SpongeBob, how about this for the...
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward! How about some kind of autograph? [Squidward stops talking]
Squidward: A autograph? Only if you talk to yourself.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward! What are you talking about?
Squidward: I said, I like Squiddy. [points to Squiddy] I don't know what he likes, but he's a monster. [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to him]
Patrick: Well, who's better to go with than Squidward? [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to him again]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward! He's a monster.
Patrick: But I don't wanna talk about him!
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, you just need to talk to yourself.
Squidward: I just can't do that. I'm too talkative.
SpongeBob: And that just leaves you with this: Squidward is a monster!
Patrick: [Goes to Squidward] Well, okay, then. Have fun!
Squidward: [Goes back to talking to himself] I'm a monster.
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward?
Patrick: Uh-oh. Squidward?
Squidward: [Looking at himself in the mirror] I'm a monster.
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, you need to talk your shell off.
