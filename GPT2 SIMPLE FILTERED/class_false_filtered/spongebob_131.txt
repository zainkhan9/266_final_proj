[At the zoo, Plankton and Squidward are having zoo sessions.]
Squidward: Plankton, I thought you'd just take the bus home.
Plankton: [starts crying] What? What did you do to my brain?
Squidward: I said, "You're not allowed to go to the zoo until you get back."
Plankton: Well, you can't just walk out there with a big ol' granny on her lunch break, are you? Not like that.
[Squidward puts a blanket over Plankton.]
Plankton: Oh, no! You're not allowed to go to the zoo until you get back.
[SpongeBob walks up to Squidward.]
SpongeBob: Hello, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'm so sorry you're so upset with me.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I'll take it back.
Squidward: No way, SpongeBob. You're my friend.
SpongeBob: Oh, that one's on your windshield.
Squidward: Who cares about my friend's health? I've seen enough.
SpongeBob: I don't care about your health. [tries to smile] I promise. Just take a look around. [points to the zoo] There's plenty of food for everybody.
Squidward: I'm gonna get a taxi to the zoo.
SpongeBob: Okay.
Squidward: Don't forget your taxi number.
SpongeBob: Okay, see ya at the zoo. [talks to Plankton, who is in a gorilla costume] Hey, Plankton, what happened to you?
Plankton: [chuckles] Oh, I just wanted to say that today I'm honored to be a part of the community I love. It's just a little... [muffled] ...initiative. [pushes SpongeBob aside]
SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton, don't you have any friends?
Plankton: Yeah, good luck! [giggles]
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Plankton. I just wanted to say that today I'm honored to be a part of the community I love. It's just a little... [muffled] ...initiative. [pushes SpongeBob aside]
SpongeBob: No, thanks, Plankton. But I don't think you should be having this fun.
Plankton: Okay. Okay.
SpongeBob: Okay, thanks, Plankton. But I think I'd better let you know if you're in any trouble.
Plankton: Well, I've got another idea.
SpongeBob: Okay, I'll be right back. [goes to put his umbrella on Plankton's head] Hey, I know it.
Plankton: [leans over and puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth] Listen to me, Plankton. I've got another idea.
SpongeBob: [leans over and puts his hand over Plankton's mouth again] You know, Plankton, I think I can use my umbrella.
Plankton: Oh, SpongeBob, I know it. I've got another idea.
SpongeBob: [leans over and puts his hand over Plankton's mouth again] Okay, I'll be right back with you. Plankton!
Plankton: [leans over and puts his hand over SpongeBob's mouth again] Okay, SpongeBob. What do you know?
SpongeBob: [leans over and puts his hand over Plankton's mouth again] Okay, I'll be right back with you. Plankton, you're in trouble.
Plankton: Well, I think I can use my umbrella. I'm kinda hungry.
[SpongeBob and Plankton sit on a small bench. The banana peeler appears on the bench. The banana peeler puts sand in his mouth.]
Plankton: [licks his lips] I think you'll like my idea. [laughs]

SpongeBob: I think I like the idea of you two making me-
