Mr. Krabs: Wonderful Neptune Day, Mr. Squidward! 
Squidward: [hiding in the sand] I know you're here for the Christmas party, but what'd you want?
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] I don't know. I'm late for the party. 
Squidward: Oh! [runs to the front door]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Hey! It's Christmas, Squidward! 
Squidward: [frowns] What would you like to hold in my... [Mr. Krabs opens the door] ...Christmas card? 
Mr. Krabs: [shocked] Don't say it! I've been working on that one! 
Squidward: The rest is history.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm afraid you're not finished yet!
Mr. Krabs: [stops shaking] I still don't know what this holiday is.
Squidward: [sighs] It's not even... [Mr. Krabs turns back to normal and walks away]
SpongeBob: [screams] What happened to Mr. Krabs? [Mr. Krabs's eyes get full of water] Mr. Krabs! [Mr. Krabs bursts through the door and runs into his house, screaming] Mr. Krabs!

[Mr. Krabs is completely flat back in his bed, but his eyes still have water on them] Mr. Krabs!
