SpongeBob: Wow! [Squidward runs up to Squidward] Squidward? Squidward?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'd love to, but I'm late for my knucklehead conference call. [Squidward answers the phone, but SpongeBob's voice is too strong]
SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing?
Squidward: It's a relief to know that I can still be here. I've never been so tired before.
SpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward. You got your wish.
Squidward: Well, let's see what happens. [Squidward is scared and runs away]
