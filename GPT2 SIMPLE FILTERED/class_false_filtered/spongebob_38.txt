<Start Ep> 
[The episode starts at the Krusty Krab. The scene opens to the exterior of the restaurant. SpongeBob walks up to the counter. He looks inside. He is shocked at what he saw. He looks over at Mr. Krabs.]
Mr. Krabs: Wow, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Ooh, Mr. Krabs, I just came in to tell you something. I'm not a fry cook, and I don't want to be.
Mr. Krabs: Well, that doesn't mean you're not a good eatery.
SpongeBob: Oh, it's just that you're not my natural habitat.
Mr. Krabs: That's right, it's my natural habitat.
SpongeBob: So, you two are gonna teach me how to make...
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] SpongeBob, how to make... [holds up spatula. SpongeBob takes the spatula and makes a Krabby Patty. Mr. Krabs takes out a spatula, and makes a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob's eyes fill up with joy. Mr. Krabs comes out of the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Way to go, boy!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you need to get to the bottom of this.
Mr. Krabs: But I'm afraid there's no way I can get your patty to the table, boy.
SpongeBob: Well, then what are you gonna do with it?
Mr. Krabs: [gives SpongeBob a Krabby Patty] Oh, I don't know, but I'm gonna...
SpongeBob: No, wait, Mr. Krabs! I'm not hungry!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, wait! I'm sorry! I'm not hungry! I'm not hungry! I'm not hungry! I'm not hungry! [Mr. Krabs takes out a Krabby Patty] Oh.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you just gotta... [Mr. Krabs puts the patty in his mouth; he swallows it]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, boy. Now, I gotta go get some food.
SpongeBob: I'm hungry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [muffled] Oh, no, boy. It's not food.
SpongeBob: Food? [takes the patty out of his mouth] Food is food.
Mr. Krabs: All right, all right. But I've got to hurry, boy, get to the safe part of the restaurant. [Mr. Krabs stops]
SpongeBob: All right, all right. All right, all right! [Mr. Krabs stops moving]
Mr. Krabs: All right, all right! I'll just be back in a minute.
SpongeBob: I'm ready! [runs to the safe place] All right, all right! [both run into the safe; one of the doors is locked; Mr. Krabs closes it] All right, all right! [they both exit the safe, and the doors close]
Mr. Krabs: You'll never get food here, boy!
SpongeBob: But I'll try! [trips and falls]
Mr. Krabs: All right, that's it! [tries to free himself from the safe, but he ends up falling and getting electrocuted] Ow! [falls on his head] Ow! [falls on the floor] Ow! [falls on the floor, but he gets himself out of the safe] Ow!
