SpongeBob: Good morning, world, and wondrous excursion, world! Thanks for the invitation. Catch the sunrise, SpongeBob. [goes to sleep but wakes up from another dream, this time with a headache and a look on his face]
Patrick: Good morning, world!
SpongeBob: I'm alive!
Patrick: Well, good mornin'.
[SpongeBob and Patrick continue to sleep. Patrick wakes up from a flashback in which he is on a picnic with his friends. He sees the sun set on the west side of town. He runs to the Krusty Krab where he enters the restaurant.]
Patrick: Wow! [grabs a Krabby Patty] It's the only restaurant in town open to the public.
[A Krabby Patty is taken away by the customer and he eats it. Patrick and SpongeBob are shocked at what happened. They scream and run inside the restaurant. Patrick awakes in the kitchen, where he sees a sign that says "Krabby Patties Only". They walk out.]
Patrick: I thought it was here. [goes inside the restaurant] Hey, where'd he go? [looks in the register and notices the Krabby Patty] Oh!
[SpongeBob and Patrick scream when they see the sign. SpongeBob and Patrick continue to scream until they see a fish in a fishnet. They jump out of the net. The fish in the net is Patrick. SpongeBob and Patrick scream as they see Patrick's naked body in the register. Patrick pulls out a mirror and sees his naked body. He screams that he is naked.]
Patrick: Oh! Oh, my! Oh! Oh! [gets an idea] Oh, oh!
[A fish enters the kitchen and grabs SpongeBob and Patrick. The two continue to scream until they finally get an idea. The fish opens the door and SpongeBob and Patrick enter. Patrick and SpongeBob scream until they see Patrick's naked body.]
Patrick: Oh, my!
SpongeBob: Is he naked?
Patrick: Yes.
[The fish grabs SpongeBob and Patrick.]
SpongeBob: What's wrong, Patrick?
