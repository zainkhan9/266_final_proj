[At night, SpongeBob is basking in the sun, reading a book that is stuck in his shell.]
SpongeBob: [Singing] Ah, sleep is good. [He opens the book and sees a picture of a baby crying. He takes out a baby crying baby book and puts it in the book] Oh, that's the story of a baby crying at a baby reading, too.
[The baby cries until SpongeBob pulls the book away and the crying baby book flies out of the book. The book flies back and forth in the book's hole. The baby book flies over the baby book and SpongeBob jumps out.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [Comes out the back of the hole] Ah, I've never seen such a story before.
[SpongeBob looks out the front of the hole.]
SpongeBob: Huh?
