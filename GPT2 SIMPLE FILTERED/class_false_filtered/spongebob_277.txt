Squidward: My name is Squidward, I am a janitor at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Did you know Squidward is a jerk?
Squidward: Oh, I've never heard of that before. [sniffs]
SpongeBob: What's he like?
Squidward: He's the best. [pokes SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: He keeps his dignity.
Squidward: See, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: How could you? You must be the jerk.
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I thought I'd tell him about the secret formula. [Squidward snaps his fingers. SpongeBob and Squidward look in the mirror. Squidward is wearing a pink wig.]
Squidward: Oh, I'm sorry.
SpongeBob: It's okay. I just need to wear a wig.
Squidward: [muffled] How?
SpongeBob: [putting wig on head] You don't want to wear a wig.
Squidward: Why not?
SpongeBob: Because you...
