Patrick: What's the matter, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I've been working on my jellyfishing net.
Patrick: I don't have time for that.
SpongeBob: I'll take care of it. [Patrick grabs the jellyfishing net and shakes it]
Patrick: Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. I've got a lot of jellyfishing to do.
Patrick: Don't worry. I have plenty of time.

Patrick: [laughs] Oh, come on. I've got a lot of jellyfishing to do.

SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick!
Patrick: I'm so glad you weren't injured.

SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick, it's just a joke!
Patrick: I'm so sorry. I think I'll have to use my new netting. [takes out a new one]

Patrick: Huh, I thought this was a net. [SpongeBob grabs a pair of underwear and puts them on SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: Hmmm.
Patrick: [takes out a new net] This is great! I don't have to go out anymore!
