[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab as SpongeBob and Patrick are eating Krabby Patties.]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what do you like to eat here? [SpongeBob and Patrick are both eating the same plate of Krabby Patties]
SpongeBob: [chewing a plate of Krabby Patties] Well, I have a suggestion.
Patrick: Great, I'll get you work! [notices the plate of Krabby Patties] Huh, sorry, SpongeBob, but I don't think you should be eating here. I think we should make an open-mic!
SpongeBob: What? Wait a minute, Patrick, why would you want to do that?
Patrick: I don't know what you're saying, but it's really not in the menu.
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's not in the menu!
Patrick: That's not in the menu!
SpongeBob: Well, I've heard of someone who does want to make something open-mic, but doesn't know what to do with it.
Patrick: Not in the food!
[The scene changes back to Squidward's house.]
Squidward: So, we're all out? What else are you doing out there?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is in his bed] Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: You can't live in the moment.
SpongeBob: [laughs] I do what I do best, and I do it with a certain amount of dignity.
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I'm out here working, working out, doing my thing. I never really realized how much I've ruined my life.
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: It's a long story, but I want to give you the full story.
Squidward: Okay.
SpongeBob: Okay.
Squidward: [takes out a book and reads it]
Squidward: [reading [in his] book] "The Complete SpongeBob SquarePants Personal and Business Book Guide."
SpongeBob: It's a real book, Squidward!
Squidward: What's it called?
SpongeBob: "The Complete SpongeBob SquarePants Personal and Business Book Guide." It's a real book. Squidward?
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I'm gonna have to make a new life for myself.
Squidward: [laughs] You're kidding! I can't believe it.
SpongeBob: Yeah, I gotta make myself money.
Squidward: You mean by that you're not a real person?
SpongeBob: Aww.
Squidward: But, now that you two are both without money, what do we have to do?
SpongeBob: We'll take our lives.
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: We'll take our lives.
Squidward: No, wait, no!
SpongeBob: We gotta take care of our money.
Squidward: Money?
SpongeBob: Money! Money!
Squidward: No, wait!
SpongeBob: I've got to work!
Squidward: No, wait!
SpongeBob: I've gotta earn more money!
Squidward: No, wait!
SpongeBob: I've got to buy more things!
Squidward: No, wait!
SpongeBob: I've got to have my cake and eat it!
Squidward: No!
SpongeBob: I've got to maintain my sanity!
Squidward: No! No, wait!
SpongeBob: I've got to take care of my friends!
Squidward: [screams] I've got to take care of my treasured possessions!
SpongeBob: It's not enough just to take care of yourself!
Squidward: No! It's also a job!
SpongeBob: Uhh, wait a minute.
Squidward: What's a job?
SpongeBob: It's gonna be taking care of my stuff.
Squidward: [screams] I've got to take care of my stuff!
SpongeBob: It's not enough just to take care of yourself!
Squidward: No! It's also a job!
SpongeBob: It's gonna be taking care of my stuff.
