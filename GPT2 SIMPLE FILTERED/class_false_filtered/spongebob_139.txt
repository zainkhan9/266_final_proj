SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! I'm your janitor! [squidward stammers, squeaking, as he becomes scared]
Squidward: SpongeBob, I've been working at the Krusty Krab for a year. How did you get here?
SpongeBob: All I know is: I was working for the devil. [raspberries fly everywhere, causing Squidward to faint. SpongeBob and Squidward fly over to the green guy, who then screeches]
Squidward: Oh, Squidward!
SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing here?
Squidward: I'm here for the devil!
SpongeBob: Oh, why don't you just let me stay here forever?
Squidward: Oh...uh-huh.
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, you're a big jerk. [laughs] I've got a confession to make. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to tell you who.
SpongeBob: Who?
Squidward: [notices SpongeBob and drags him away] SpongeBob, the janitor at the Krusty Krab. I was cleaning up the Chum Bucket.
SpongeBob: What did you find out about the Chum Bucket?
Squidward: Oh, I found out that it was a vampire who had a toothbrush.
SpongeBob: Did you pick it up or did you take it from him?
Squidward: Oh, I picked it up.
SpongeBob: Oh, what happened to it?
Squidward: That toothbrush was supposed to be for me.
SpongeBob: Well, there was one more thing for you to find.
Squidward: That was a very expensive, very expensive toothpaste.
SpongeBob: I should've known. This is my life.
Squidward: And how is it gonna be when I get back?
SpongeBob: Well, I gotta go grab some food.
Squidward: Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob: I'm gonna have to go get some food for myself.
Squidward: [scoffs] Really?
SpongeBob: Yep.
Squidward: [leans over to the table] Oh, SpongeBob, I've got to ask you something.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: [scoffs] Well, if you're gonna go out and have fun, then you must make it fun.
SpongeBob: Oh, no, no, no, no!
Squidward: [scoffs] I know! I'll just have to wear a hat! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, you're a great host.
Squidward: [laughs] I'll take a hat, SpongeBob, and live in harmony with the music.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah.
