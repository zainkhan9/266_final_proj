[The scene changes to the Chum Bucket and Squidward is standing next to a table of various items]
Squidward: These stuff are so expensive I can barely afford a pair of shoes.
[Squidward takes out a pair of shoes and puts the pair of shoes on the table]
Squidward: And this stuff is so fancy it's almost comically fancy.
[The scene changes to Squidward walking in the Krusty Krab]

Mr. Krabs: [sits down] What do you have?
Squidward: [reads the cards] "Krabby Patties are Coming!"
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, can I help you?
SpongeBob: [sitting in a rocking chair] I have a very simple, but very important business card.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you've got a nice card.
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: What?

Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you've got a nice card.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, one card at a time, please.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I've got some very important cards that I need to help you with. Would you mind putting them away for a second?
Mr. Krabs: [takes out two business cards, one for himself and one for SpongeBob] SpongeBob, could you please put the cards away for a second?
SpongeBob: Sure, of course, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I know you're working here, but I don't need your help. I can help you with my business cards. Why don't you help me?
SpongeBob: I'm trying to make a living, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you're not working.
SpongeBob: What? But what if I helped you?
Mr. Krabs: [pointing to a mailbox] Get it?
SpongeBob: Never mind, Mr. Krabs. I'm just interested in helping.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I suppose you're ready for your first card.
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. [points to a card that reads "Help Wanted"] Oh, Mr. Krabs. Well, what's the big idea?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm looking for an employee at your place of business.
SpongeBob: Well, I'll go check on you.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'll help you get this card.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, just a second.
SpongeBob: It's a very important card. It's your signature.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] You think I can help you with that?
SpongeBob: [sitting on a chair] I say I help you with my business cards.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not helping you with my business cards.
SpongeBob: I'm helping you with my business cards.
